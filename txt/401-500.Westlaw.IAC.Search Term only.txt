IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicomedes E. Suriel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer I. Gaz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (found)
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; reopening; termination
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 17, 2014, decision. The respondent has also filed a motion to terminate during the pendency of this appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion to terminate. The appeal will be dismissed and the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion and judgment. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On September 17, 2014, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1). The Immigration Judge’s order reflects that, in exchange for the grant of voluntary departure, the respondent, with the assistance of counsel, waived appeal (Tr. at 37-40). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). We are not persuaded that the respondent’s conclusory statement in the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), maintaining that he was pressured by the Immigration Judge to accept the grant of voluntary departure, is sufficient to demonstrate that his waiver of appeal was not knowing and voluntary, especially because the respondent was represented by counsel before the Immigration Judge and has not suggested that his prior attorney committed ineffective assistance of counsel. See Biwot v. Gonzales, 403 F.3d 1094, 1097-98 (9th Cir. 2005) (explaining that a waiver of the right to appeal must be knowing and voluntary to be effective); Matter of Rodrigeuz-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000) (same). We therefore lack jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal, including his claim that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for administrative closure.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39 (explaining that an Immigration Judge’s order becomes final upon issuance if both parties waive appeal); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697, 699 (BIA 1993); Saenz-Kobel v. Holder, 459 Fed. Appx. 591, 592 (9th Cir. 2011); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(B) (explaining that in accepting a grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure, an alien must waive all additional applications for relief).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has filed a motion requesting that proceedings be terminated so that he may seek adjustment of status before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The respondent wishes to pursue an application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). Inasmuch as the Immigration Judge’s decision became final upon the respondent’s waiver of appeal, this request must comply with the requirements of a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b), 1003.2(b). However, the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act (cf. Tr. at 33). See Lopez-Vasquez v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1072, 1080 (9th Cir. 2013); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party requesting reopening bears a “heavy burden” of establishing that the outcome of proceedings would likely be different if the motion were granted).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to terminate is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

We also note that the respondent indicated on the Notice of Appeal that he would file a separate statement or brief in support of his arguments but has not done so. Accordingly, if we had jurisdiction over this matter, the respondent’s appeal would be subject to summary dismissal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luke H. Abrusley, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorraine L. Griffin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 20, 2015, denying his request for voluntary departure under the provisions of section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), as a matter of discretion and ordering his removal from the United States.1 The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board that he has demonstrated that he merits the privilege of voluntary departure as matter of discretion. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d); Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 22 I&N Dec. 811, 820 (BIA 1999); Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972). Even though the record does not contain formal conviction documents, the respondent, through counsel, has conceded that has he has been convicted of driving under the influence on two occasions (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 7; Exh. 2). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (holding that, absent a showing of egregious circumstances, an attorney’s concessions are binding upon an alien as an admission). There can be little dispute that drunk driving is an extremely serious offense. See, e.g., United States v. Chapa-Garza, 262 F.3d 479, 485 (5th Cir. 2001). The respondent also has other convictions, and was previously granted a voluntary return after apprehension (Exh. 2). The respondent has not meaningfully articulated any positive factors, i.e., family ties to the United States or a history of gainful employment, which would warrant a holding that, despite his history of drunk driving, he warrants voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. Thus, upon a balancing of the appropriate factors, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for voluntary departure as a matter of discretion (I.J. at 2).
 
*2 Finally, there is an absence of indicia that the respondent’s former counsel attempted to him to call him to testify regarding his positive equities or present evidence of positive equities. The respondent has not complied with the evidentiary standards for bringing forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has not articulated the testimony or evidence that he would have presented in these proceedings. Thus, he has not established that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s handling of this case. See Anwar v. INS, 116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir. 1997). As such, we decline to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s request for voluntary departure. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
For the reasons set forth above, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to order the respondent’s removal from the United States to Guatemala. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent, through counsel, has conceded that is subject to removal from the United States because he is an alien who is present in this country without being admitted or paroled by an immigration officer or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Mbacho, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
O. El-Bogdadi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 14, 2014, decision that denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge. In this case, the record reflects that the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) (Exh. 1). On April 8, 2014, the San Diego Immigration Court personally served a hearing notice on the respondent’s attorney of record, Russell Bolin, rescheduling the respondent’s hearing for June 20, 2014. The respondent failed to appear for his hearing as scheduled and he was ordered removed in absentia.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorney of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). Moreover, the record contains a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) for Mr. Bolin, as required by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.4(a).
 
To the extent that the respondent argues exceptional circumstances because his prior attorney did not. inform him about the date and time of his hearing, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy any of the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). We also decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Moreover, we are not persuaded by counsel for the respondent’s argument that the respondent’s failure to appear was due to a clerical error in his office. As the Immigration Judge observed, Attorney Mbacho had not entered his appearance in this matter prior to the April 8, 2014, hearing and there is no indication in the record that Attorney Mbacho entered his appearance by filling a form EOIR-28 with the Immigration Judge prior to the in absentia order. We therefore decline to further address this issue.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Catherine Susan Willmore, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ryan A. Kahler
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)] - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i)
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s June 24, 2014, decision, which denied the respondent’s request for a continuance. The respondent was granted the privilege of voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent’s removability is not disputed. Indeed, the record confirms that the respondent, through his attorney, conceded his removability under both sections 237(a)(1)(A) and 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(A) and 1227(a)(1)(C)(i) as charged in the Notice to Appear (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 28; Exh. 1). However, we do acknowledge the respondent’s statement in the Notice of Appeal apparently challenging the charge under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act. In this regard, we have held that, absent egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney (in this case admitting to the allegations and conceding to the corresponding charges lodged in the Notice to Appear) is binding on the client. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Valasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). The respondent has not alleged any egregious circumstances; nor do we find any such circumstances on this record. Indeed, the respondent has not alleged that his attorney was ineffective or complied with the procedural requirements, as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Regardless, the respondent does not dispute on appeal his removability under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
The remaining issue raised on appeal by the respondent is whether the Immigration Judge should have continued the removal proceedings for him to further pursue an administrative appeal of the denial of his U-visa application (Form I-918) by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). However, the respondent has failed to specify any legal or factual error in the Immigration Judge’s decision, and we are satisfied that the Immigration Judge applied the appropriate factors in denying the continuance. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

File: AXXX XX4 672 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joaquin A. Talleda, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 23, 2013, decision denying her motion to suppress evidence and to terminate proceedings.1 The respondent also filed a motion asking that the Board hold her appeal in abeyance, pending the result of her application to the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS”) for exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board uses a de novo standard of review for questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Notice to Appear (“NTA”), alleging that the respondent is a native and citizen of Nicaragua unlawfully present in the United States, was personally served on the respondent on August 4, 2008 (Exh. 1). The service of the NTA was accomplished with the cooperation of the respondent’s counsel, after the respondent and several other female natives of Nicaragua were detained and questioned as part of an investigation into human trafficking in the Los Angeles, California, area (Exh. 5E -I-213). According to the respondent’s appeal brief and her motion to suppress, after the respondent and the other Nicaraguan natives were apprehended and questioned by officers with the Burbank, California, police department about potentially being human trafficking victims, they were questioned by officers with the DHS’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) branch. See Respondent’s Motion to Suppress at 6; Brief at 2-3. After their release by the police department, the respondent was scheduled for an interview with ICE (Id.). Counsel for the respondent indicated that he worked with ICE to provide advance information so that the “NTA [could be] prepared in advance.” See Motion to Suppress at 8. Pursuant to this agreement, counsel for the respondent provided a completed “““Background Information Sheet” for the respondent in which she admitted that she was a native and citizen of Nicaragua. See Motion to Suppress at Exh. K. Based on this, the DHS prepared the Form I-213 in which the respondent is described as admitting that she is a native and citizen of Nicaragua (Exh. 5E).
 
*2 The respondent sought suppression of the I-213, arguing that the “““admission” referenced therein was not obtained directly by the undersigned officer via questioning of the respondent, but rather through the submission of the “Background Information Sheet” that was allegedly filled out by a secretary for the respondent’s counsel. See Motion to Suppress at 8-10, 13-14. The respondent therefore alleged that the information in the I-213 was unreliable hearsay. See id. Furthermore, the respondent argued that the information is unreliable because the secretary who obtained the information for the “Background Information Sheet” was later fired from counsel’s firm due to theft Id. at 9. The respondent repeats the same arguments on appeal.
 
We will dismiss the appeal. A request to exclude evidence is made via a motion to suppress that is supported by an affidavit or other objective evidence that explains why suppression is appropriate. Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 1988); Matter of Wong, 13 I&N Dec. 820, 822 (BIA 1971). When an alien has come forward with adequate evidence in support of suppression, the burden shifts to the DHS to justify the manner in which it obtained the evidence. Matter of Barcenas, supra, at 611.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s assessment that the information with regard to the respondent’s alienage in the I-213, which was obtained via counsel’s provision of the “Background Information Sheet,” is sufficiently reliable (May 7, 2013, I.J. at 2). The respondent has not offered evidence to suggest that the information contained therein was false or obtained by coercion or duress. Matter of Barcenas, supra, at 611. The fact that it contains hearsay is not itself a compelling reason to suppress the Form I-213, since an Immigration Judge is authorized to consider hearsay evidence if it is reliable and if its use is fundamentally fair. Id.; see also Gu v. Gonzales, 454 F.3d 1014, 1021 (9th Cir. 2006); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980).
 
Furthermore, we also will affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that it was proper for the DHS to prepare the Form I-213 using counsel’s admissions on the behalf of the respondent. These admissions distinguish the respondent’s case from any where a Form I-213 may have been found insufficiently reliable on the basis of hearsay not involving representations by the alien’s own counsel. The respondent is bound by the admissions and concessions of her counsel in these proceedings. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). The respondent has neither argued nor presented egregious circumstances sufficient to conclude that she should not be bound by her counsel’s judicial admissions. Id. (“Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission.”). Although the respondent stresses that the admissions on the “Background Information Sheet” were drafted by a secretary who was subsequently fired, they nevertheless were effectively adopted by counsel when he forwarded them to the DHS with a cover letter bearing his signature. See Motion to Suppress at Exh. K. We are also unpersuaded that the respondent should not be bound by admissions of her counsel that were made before he submitted an Entry of Appearance before the Immigration Court, since ordinary rules of professional responsibility provide adequate safeguards against counsel making unauthorized admissions. Moreover, the aforementioned signed cover letter from the respondent’s counsel to the DHS indicated that he was enclosing executed Form G-28’s (although the actual Forms are not included in the present record). In turn, Form G-28 is the proper form for entering an attorney appearance before the DHS, the agency with which the respondent was interacting at the time in question.
 
*3 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an alien may be relieved of counsel’s admissions when not doing so would produce an unjust result (such as where the admission is inadvertent) or where the admissions contains untrue or incorrect information. See Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820, 831-32 (9th Cir. 2011). The respondent has not established that either circumstance is present here, and we therefore find no cause to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to suppress, and to find the respondent removable as charged. See Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir. 2009) (refusing to permit an alien to withdraw his attorney’s tactical decision to admit alienage).
 
While this appeal was pending before the Board, on June 4, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to hold her appeal in abeyance pending a resolution of her application to the DHS to exercise prosecutorial discretion in her case. We interpret this motion as seeking administrative closure of these proceedings in the exercise of discretion. The respondent’s appellate argument regarding her equities in this regard is unavailing here, because the DHS has sole authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this matter. Neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982). We recognize that our lack of jurisdiction over the actual exercise of prosecutorial discretion by the DHS does not also divest us of jurisdiction to order administrative closure pending the DHS’s determination. See Singh v. Holder, 771 F.3d 647 (9th Cir. 2014). Nevertheless, given the lack of any indication that the DHS will exercise its sole prosecutorial discretion authority in a manner favorable to the respondent, we conclude that an exercise of our own discretionary authority to administratively close proceedings is not appropriate. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012). Absent a showing of a readily available form of relief from removal, we find administrative closure unsupported on this record. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, supra, at 505 (once the DHS institutes proceedings, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge). Consequently, we will deny the motion to hold this appeal in abeyance, and we will dismiss the appeal on the following orders.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent’s motion to suppress the Form I-213 and to terminate proceedings was denied in a May 7, 2013, decision by the Immigration Judge that will hereinafter be referenced as “May 7, 2013, I.J. at __.” The decision ordering her removal from the United States to Nicaragua, which was issued after continued proceedings to determine whether the respondent wished to file any application for relief from removal, is dated October 23, 2013. Both decisions are covered by this appeal. Although the Immigration Judge indicated in the October 23, 2013, decision that she had reviewed whether the respondent had received effective assistance of counsel, we note that the respondent does not argue on appeal that she received ineffective assistance of counsel below.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles Spector, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brenda J. Thomas
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. She has filed a timely motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the granting of the motion. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent contends that former counsel erroneously conceded her removability under section 237(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(E)(i). The record reflects, however, that former counsel denied removability, and contested the charge (Exh. 1; I.J. at 1). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s adjustment of status was an admission and since she was admitted within 5 years of her conviction for smuggling, she was removable as charged (I.J. at 2-3).
 
The respondent now argues she is not removable because her adjustment of status was not an admission, citing to Martinez v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 532 (5th Cir. 2008)(section 212(h) waiver applies to aliens who adjust their status after entering the United States, but not to those who enter the United States as lawful permanent residents); Matter of J-H-J-, 26 I&N Dec. 563 (BIA 2015). However, Martinez did not hold that adjustment of status was not an admission. Further, we have consistently held that adjustment of status is considered an admission. See e.g. Matter of Bouchra Agour, 26 I&N Dec. 566, 573 (BIA 2015). Accordingly, we do not find that former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel to the respondent such that proceedings should be reopened and termination. Nor has the respondent shown the requisite prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pablo Fernandez-Herrera, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 7, 2014, denying his motion for a continuance. On appeal, the respondent also moves for a remand based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We find that the Immigration Judge acted properly in concluding the proceedings and entering an order of removal. The pursuit of deferred action before the Department of Homeland Security does not constitute good cause for a continuance because the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a matter over which the Immigration Court has no jurisdiction and the possibility that the respondent would be granted such relief was speculative. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982) (Immigration Judge did not err in declining to adjourn hearing to allow alien to pursue deferred action); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6.
 
We find no merit in the respondent’s argument that the decision below requires reversal because the Immigration Judge made prejudicial remarks concerning his potential eligibility for deferred action. Under the circumstances, we find that the Immigration Judge merely gave a fair summary of the posture of the respondent’s potential application for deferred action. In any event, the respondent must demonstrate substantial prejudice affecting the outcome of the proceedings to establish a due process violation warranting reversal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Miller v. Mukasey, 539 F.3d 159, 164 (2d Cir. 2008). We are not persuaded that the respondent has done so. Absent a showing of good cause or readily available relief, the Immigration Judge acted properly in ordering the respondent’s removal. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (citations omitted) (once removal proceedings are instituted, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge). There is no merit in the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal deprived him of the opportunity to persuade DHS counsel that he was a suitable candidate for deferred action on his removal since nothing prevents him from applying to the DHS to favorably exercise its prosecutorial discretion even after an order of removal is entered.
 
*2 We will deny the respondent’s motion to remand based upon ineffective assistance. As an initial matter, the claim fails because the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements outlined in the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The claim also fails because the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the actions or inaction of prior counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (an alien asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice). The substance of the respondent’s claim is that prior counsel failed to make a persuasive case for deferred action on his removal (Brief at 8). However, an application for deferred action is a collateral matter involving the DHS’ independent exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and outside the jurisdiction of the Immigration Court. Therefore, any deficiencies in representation concerning that application are insufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance in the proceedings before the Immigration Court.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Candice Kasperson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, has appealed the May 20, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge denying a motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has not submitted a brief in support of this appeal, despite indicating on his Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) that he intends to file a separate brief or statement. Hence, we will consider the limited statements contained on the. respondent’s Notice of Appeal.
 
The arguments contained on the respondent’s Notice of Appeal do not specifically challenge the Immigration Judge’s reasons for denying the motion to reopen. The respondent simply states: “The Immigration Judge erred in applying the facts and case law. The IJ did not address the merits of the motion to re-open. The IJ abused her discretion and did not meaningfully address the motion and reasons why Respondent did not seek relief earlier.” Inasmuch as the respondent has not specifically challenged the bases for the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, we find that the respondent’s arguments on appeal do not establish error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. See, e.g., Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal); Matter of Gutierrez, 19 I&N Dec. 562, 565 n.3 (BIA 1988) (same).1
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen A. Lagana, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 19, 2015, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The respondent’s appeal fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent based his motion to reopen on an apparent contention that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance because he only communicated with the respondent through his girlfriend when the respondent was detained. See Respondent’s Brief at 3. On appeal, the respondent argues that, inter alia, the Immigration Judge erred by finding that the motion to reopen was not timely filed. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-4. As the Immigration Judge alternatively found, however, even if the motion had been timely, the respondent did not satisfy the requirements for reopening (I.J. at 4, 5).
 
“A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). In addition, to obtain reopening, the respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is statutorily eligible for the relief sought and that he warrants relief in the exercise of discretion. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 106 (1988). Prima facie eligibility is shown where the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied and that there is a reasonable likelihood that relief will be granted in the exercise of discretion. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996).
 
In this case, the respondent requested that his proceedings be reopened but he did not submit an application for relief or supporting documentation. See Motion to Reopen; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (motion to reopen to apply for relief must include the application for relief and supporting evidence). In his motion, the respondent stated only that he “was denied the opportunity to apply for political asylum.” Motion to Reopen at 3. He did not submit an asylum application or present material evidence that was unavailable at the former hearing. Therefore, because the respondent has not submitted an application or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for relief, he has not met the requirements for reopening.
 
*2 The respondent also argues that, when he waived his right to appeal on April 16, 2014, his waiver was not knowing and voluntary (Tr. at 8-10). See Respondent’s Brief at 5-6. The respondent did not raise this argument in his motion, however. See Motion to Reopen; Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007) (matters not raised before the Immigration Judge are waived on appeal); see also Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 638 (BIA 2003); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196-97 n.4 (BIA 1990). Also, although the respondent argues that, because he waived his right to appeal, he lost his opportunity to apply for asylum, he again has not submitted an asylum application or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for asylum. Therefore, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by the error he alleges. See Toribio-Chavez v. Holder, 611 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir. 2010) (due process claim cannot succeed without a showing of prejudice).1
 
Further, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent did not comply with at least some of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (to succeed on a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent should submit an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts including the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken; former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed to respond; the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities; the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (I.J. at 5). Additionally, the respondent did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
For these reasons, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vincent J. Benincasa, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on March 13, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen to rescind his order of removal (which was entered in absentia on May 24, 2007, due to his failure to appear at his hearing, as scheduled). On April 13, 2015, more than 7 years later, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with this Board alleging ineffective assistance provided by his former attorney (Esther A. Zaretsky), and a non-attorney (Fabian Sosa), at various points in time. The motion will be denied.
 
Insofar as the respondent is moving to reopen to rescind his May 24, 2007, in absentia removal order-whether based on a claim of lack of notice, or a new claim of “exceptional circumstances” beyond his control (including ineffective assistance of counsel) accounting for his failure to appear-his motion must be filed with the Immigration Judge.1 Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondent also advances specific claims of ineffective assistance in conjunction with his June 18, 2007, motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia removal order (filed in Immigration Court), and his ensuing appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying that motion.2 Motion to Reopen (Motion) at 5-6. However, the respondent’s motion in this regard was filed April 13, 2015, more than 90 days after we issued our March 13, 2008, decision dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision. Therefore, insofar as the instant motion to reopen is based on these particular claims of ineffective assistance, his motion is untimely by several years.
 
Notwithstanding this circumstance, the Eleventh Circuit otherwise recognizes that the 90-day filing deadline for motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel may be equitably tolled under certain circumstances. Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra at 1363-65. Pursuant to controlling case law, to establish eligibility for equitable tolling an alien must show that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way. Id. at 1363 n.5, and the cases cited therein.
 
As pertinent to whether equitable tolling is available to the instant motion to reopen, we note that the respondent admits to having received our March 13, 2008, decision. Motion, Tab D, p. 15 (respondent’s affidavit, paragraph 6). He contends that because he could not read or understand our decision, he went to attorney Zaretsky for an explanation and was told that “everything was fine, and that [he] had nothing to worry about.” Ibid. Further, the respondent indicates that he did not pursue a motion to reopen because he never understood or was informed that he was subject to a removal order--that is until October 2014, when he brought his stepson to the office of his current attorney for immigration counseling. Ibid. at paragraph 7. He goes onto explain that during that counseling, his current attorney questioned him about his status, and advised that he was likely subject to a removal order.
 
*2 The evidence now presented is insufficient to demonstrate that the respondent exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing his currently-articulated claims of ineffective assistance vis-à-vis his motion to reopen to rescind and Board appeal, and in filing a motion to reopen based on these claims. It appears that the last contact the respondent had with former counsel was in 2008. Although he maintains that attorney Zaretsky told him at that time that all was find and that he had nothing to worry about, the respondent makes no claim that he was told that he had actually acquired legal status and could lawfully remain in the United States, or that he personally believed that he had the legal right to remain in the United States, without further action or proceedings in his case. Absent such advice, or understandings, it is not unreasonable to expect the respondent to have made further inquiries about his case with his former attorney at some point after their meeting in 2008, and in the 7-year period that followed before his current motion to reopen was filed on April 13, 2015. On this record, there is no indication that the respondent took any action whatsoever regarding his case for several years.
 
Further, the respondent contends that it was in pursuing immigration counseling for his stepson that he first learned of his removal order, and that he received ineffective assistance from attorney Zaretsky. He has not explained why, in October 2014, he sought immigration counseling from a new attorney, and not attorney Zaretsky (on whose representation and counsel he previously relied, and about whose representation and counsel he had no reason to doubt at that point).
 
In addition, and notwithstanding his claims concerning immigration counseling for his stepson (during which he allegedly learned for the first time of the likelihood of his own removal order), it has not been established that the respondent actually has a stepson. Birth certificates have been submitted evidencing that the respondent is the father of two United States citizen children, respectively aged 11 and 7 years. Motion, Group Tab E. However, no documentation has been provided establishing that has a stepson, or is married. In addition, no affidavit was submitted from the respondent’s alleged stepson. Therefore, the respondent’s explanation for how and when he first came to learn that he was likely subject to a removal order, and was provided ineffective assistance by attorney Zaretsky, has not been adequately, and credibly, demonstrated by his motion submissions.
 
In the absence of demonstrating that equitable tolling applies to the 90-day filing deadline for the respondent’s motion to reopen, his motion remains untimely. We also decline to reopen the respondent’s proceedings sua sponte, as the evidence presented does not establish exceptional circumstances warranting such action. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Such motions are governed by their own rules, including a 180-day filing deadline if the alien claims his failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” beyond his control. Id. Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has found that this 180-day filing deadline is subject to equitable tolling under certain circumstances. Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1362 n. 4 (11th Cir. 2013).

For the reasons stated in our March 13, 2008, decision, we concluded that the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia removal order (which was based on a claim of lack of notice) was properly denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fitzmore Harris, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 23, 2014, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his February 11, 2010, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent does not dispute that the Notice to Appear (NTA)(which contained the hearing notice for the February 11, 2010, hearing) was delivered to the correct address, but states that his spouse, with whom he resides, failed to give him the notice. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. When a hearing notice is delivered by mail but “does not reach the alien through some failure in the internal workings of the household, the alien can be charged with receiving proper notice.” Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540, 547 (BIA 2002); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001). Due process was satisfied here because the method of service was reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reached the alien. See Fuentes-Argueta v. INS, 101 F.3d 867 (2d Cir. 1996).
 
The respondent alleges that his former attorney also told him he did not have to appear for his hearing because a continuation request had been filed (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, page 3). Regarding exceptional circumstances for failing to appear, the Immigration Judge correctly found the motion to reopen was untimely (I.J. at 2). The respondent filed the motion almost four years after his in absentia order of removal became final, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), (4)(ii), and he has not established the due diligence required for equitable tolling of the filing deadline (I.J. at 2-3). See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2008).
 
Moreover, the respondent failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance claim (I.J. at 3). The requirements include submitting (1) an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with counsel, (2) proof that counsel was informed of the allegations and had an opportunity to respond, and (3) a statement regarding whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and, if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See also Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements ... forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”). Here, the respondent did not submit any evidence that he informed counsel of the allegations against him and provide him with an opportunity to respond to the allegations.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent also argues that reopening was denied in error because he has new relief insofar as his U.S. citizen spouse has filed a visa petition on his behalf. Even if the respondent had not been given oral notice in his native language, in order to pursue an application for new relief, the respondent must comply with the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3). Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Under these standards, the respondent’s May 21, 2014, motion to reopen is untimely, inasmuch as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, decision, and he has not alleged that the motion would fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to the time limits. Hence, the respondent is also precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.
 
The respondent has failed to establish that reopening is warranted pursuant to sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent’s motion does not establish an “exceptional” situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings (I.J. at 3). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Cara O. Knapp
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s December 9, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent initially entered the United States in 1996. On January 17, 2008, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied his application for adjustment of status. These removal proceedings were subsequently initiated on April 28, 2008 (Exh. 1). The respondent was represented by attorney Kevin Gibbons during the underlying removal proceedings.
 
At a March 6, 2009, master calendar hearing, the Immigration Judge set a January 3, 2011, deadline for the respondent to file his relief applications. The respondent did not comply with the filing deadline, and on January 20, 2011, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s relief applications abandoned and ordered him removed from the United States to Mexico. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (the opportunity to file applications and related documents shall be deemed waived if not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge). The Immigration Judge also vacated the next scheduled hearing on March 22, 2011.
 
On February 17, 2011, attorney Gibbons filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, claiming that he did not know about the January 3, 2011, filing deadline. On March 9, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not supplemented his motion with his relief applications as required by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The Immigration Judge also deemed the respondent’s motion abandoned by regulation because he was physically removed from the United States on February 25, 2011. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d), 1003.23(b)(i) (a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States).
 
On November 15, 2013, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen through current counsel. The respondent claimed that reopening was warranted under the in absentia statutory and regulatory provisions, and also that proceedings should be reopened sua sponte, because he did not receive notice of the “““January 20, 2011 hearing.” The respondent asserted that he was ineffectively assisted by attorney Gibbons and provided evidence that attorney Gibbons had been suspended from practicing law in Arizona. On December 9, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s motion was numerically barred and that his prior motion was considered abandoned by regulation due to his removal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), 1003.2(d). The Immigration Judge also explained that the respondent’s contention that he did not receive notice of a January 20, 2011, hearing was nonsensical because there was no hearing conducted on that date.
 
*2 The respondent appeals from this decision. The respondent continues to assert that he was ineffectively assisted by attorney Gibbons. He claims that he did not know that attorney Gibbons filed the first motion to reopen, and that he did not authorize that motion. He also claims that attorney Gibbons misled him into believing that he missed a hearing advanced from March 22, 2011, to January 20, 2011, when in reality there was no hearing on January 20, 2011. The respondent argues that under these circumstances, the numerical limitation on motions to reopen should not apply in his case and that his motion should be granted.
 
As previously noted, the respondent’s current counsel filed the second motion to reopen on November 15, 2013, arguing that attorney Gibbons committed ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to inform the respondent of a January 20, 2011 hearing. It is undisputed that there was no hearing on January 20, 2011; rather, the Immigration Judge issued his written decision on that date. Current counsel now argues on appeal that attorney Gibbons misled the respondent into believing that he missed a hearing on January 20, 2011.
 
Considering the totality of the circumstances and in the interest of justice, and without deciding the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision to the extent he declined to exercise his sua sponte authority to reopen the respondent’s case. See generally Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). In the original motion to reopen, attorney Gibbons specifically admitted that he missed the January 2, 2011, filing deadline because of “an error by counsel’s office,” and asserted that he had misunderstood or had not heard the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge did not ever address this aspect of the respondent’s motion. We also observe that the record contains the respondent’s original application for adjustment of status, as well as an updated application filed in 2009 and a copy of the approved visa petition (Exh. 5). See Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 2010) (holding that when an application for relief is timely filed but supporting documents are not submitted within the time established, the Immigration Judge may deem the opportunity to file the documents to be waived but may not deem the application itself abandoned).1 Finally, we note that the respondent’s removal from the United States did not preclude his ability initially to seek reopening within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See Toor v. Lynch, - F.3d -, 2015 WL 3756503 (9th Cir. June 17, 2015); Reyes-Torres v. Holder, 645 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2011); Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010).
 
*3 Under these facts, we will sustain the respondent’s appeal and reverse the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to sua sponte reopen these removal proceedings. We express no view as to whether the respondent ultimately can demonstrate that he is eligible for and deserving of a grant of adjustment of status or other relief. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and the denial of his motion for sua sponte reopening of his removal proceedings is reversed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark J. Devine, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott D. Criss
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 8, 2014, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reconsider. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge did not consider the request for nunc pro tunc relief discussed in his motion to reopen. The respondent explains that the evidence relating to ineffective assistance of counsel was included in the motion to reopen to provide factual support for the equitable remedy he seeks.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge issued a decision on January 16, 2014, granting the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent filed a motion to reopen on March 21, 2014, seeking reopening on the basis of a nunc pro tunc equitable remedy. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, noting that the respondent was represented by counsel during his removal proceedings, and the respondent never expressed a fear of returning to El Salvador before the court. The Immigration Judge found that absent egregious circumstances, which are not present in this case, the respondent is bound by the tactical decisions and actions made by his attorney when such attorney is acting in her professional capacity. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995). See I.J. Dec. dated March 24, 2014.
 
The respondent claims that he was denied the opportunity to file an application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. However, the respondent was represented by counsel when he accepted a pre-conclusion voluntary departure order, and he waived appeal. On appeal and in his motion to reopen, the respondent suggests that his former counsel may have provided ineffective assistance, but he has not complied with any of the requirements discussed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, the respondent did not establish any prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s representation which would warrant reopening as an equitable remedy. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (requiring prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions in addition to compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra). The purpose of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Lozada would be rendered superfluous if the proceedings were reopened on the basis of a nunc pro tunc equitable remedy under the circumstances present in this case.1 The respondent did not file an application or other documents which establish a prima facie case for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider as he did not identify any factual or legal errors in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2).
 
*2 We further find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Grace R. Kennedy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s March 26, 2015, decision, in which we denied his untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In the motion, the respondent argues that the motion to reopen time period should be equitably tolled in his case, and that he exercised due diligence since the Board’s December 16, 2013, decision dismissing his appeal until he filed his motion to reopen on December 17, 2014. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 717 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir. 2013) (stating that equitable tolling generally requires a litigant to show “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way”) (citing Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408 (2005)). However, the respondent’s prior motion did not argue that the motion to reopen time period should be equitably tolled, or that the respondent has exercised diligence since the Board’s December 16, 2013, decision. A motion to reconsider based on arguments that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.1
 
To the extent the respondent now seeks to present the equitable tolling argument and has presented new documents, his motion constitutes a motion to reopen in substance. See Matter of 0-S-G-, supra, 57-58 (a motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, while a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence). As a motion to reopen, the respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000); Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999). Therefore, it will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
Furthermore, the arguments and evidence submitted do not show that equitable tolling of the motion time or number limitations is warranted. The respondent argues that, after he received the Board’s December 16, 2013, decision dismissing his appeal, he retained another lawyer and requested the DHS to file a joint motion to reopen, but the DHS denied this request on June 24, 2014; that he attempted to obtain an affidavit from his prior counsel, Joseph Azar, but attorney Azar merely kept promising and did not actually provide an affidavit; and that he eventually filed a bar complaint against attorney Azar on December 8, 2014, and filed his motion to reopen on December 17, 2014 (Motion, at 5-7; Motion Exh. A-C).
 
*2 The motion and the respondent’s affidavit submitted with the motion do not identify the new lawyer who represented him in June 2014, but the DHS’s June 24, 2014, letter declining to join in a motion to reopen was addressed to his current counsel, indicating that the respondent was represented by his current counsel at that time (Motion Exh. C). Therefore, the letter shows that the respondent was no longer being represented by attorney Azar but was being represented by his current counsel in June 2014.2 Nevertheless, the motion to reopen was not filed until December 2014, about 6 months later. Moreover, requesting the DHS to join in a motion to reopen does not necessarily show diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and the respondent offers no explanation why he could not file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel while requesting the DHS’s help. Removable aliens should not delay matters by pursuing multiple avenues of relief seriatim when they could have been pursued simultaneously. See, e.g., Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 833, 839 (10th Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent also argues that his motion to reopen was further delayed because he was trying to obtain an affidavit from attorney Azar. However, the respondent does not argue that obtaining and submitting such an affidavit is one of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (see Motion, at 9). The respondent fails to explain why such an affidavit was necessary before he could file a bar complaint against the attorney or a motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In any event, the respondent eventually filed a bar complaint and the motion to reopen without having to obtain an affidavit from the prior attorney. Based on the above, the respondent did not show that he has been pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim diligently, or that he was prevented by “some extraordinary circumstance” from filing a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent reiterates his request for us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) and to administratively close his proceedings to allow him to seek consular processing of his visa petition. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

In the prior decision, the Board also noted that the respondent provided radically different accounts on why he did not timely appear at his December 14, 2011, hearing, in his sworn statement submitted with his March 19, 2012, motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge (the “first statement”) and in his statement submitted with the December 17, 2014, motion to reopen (the “second statement”), and that he has not reconciled these divergent accounts (Dec. 17, 2014, Motion Exh. C; Mar. 19, 2012 I.J. Motion Affidavit). The respondent now asserts in his statement submitted with the current motion (the “third statement”) that the first statement was prepared by attorney Azar and he signed it without reading it or knowing its contents (Motion Exh. A, at 6-7). However, the respondent fails to explain why this explanation could not be presented with his prior motion to reopen.
In any event, the respondent’s accounts provided in his second and third statements are not supported by the record in this case. The respondent stated in his second statement that at a hearing on September 13, 2011, the Immigration Judge gave his attorney the notice of the December 14, 2011, hearing (Dec. 17, 2014, Motion Exh. C, at 5). In his third statement, the respondent states that the Immigration Judge was not present at the September 13, 2011, hearing and the clerk of the Immigration Court gave his attorney the notice of hearing (Motion Exh. A, at 5). However, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the notice of hearing was issued to the respondent personally, not to the attorney (I.J. May 22, 2012, Dec. at 1). Thus, the respondent fails to explain why he would rely on an unnamed “assistant” at attorney Azar’s office for the hearing date and time.
The respondent asserts that “we” (i.e., he and attorney Azar) went to about 3 Immigration Court hearings and the attorney’s unnamed “assistant” would call him the day before the hearing, and that this was their “normal procedure”; thus he suggests that it would have been reasonable for him to rely on the “““assistant” (Motion Exh. A, at 5-6; Dec. 17, 2014, Motion Exh. C, at 5). However, the record shows that the respondent was presented by a different attorney, not attorney Azar, at his prior hearings, and the notices of hearing were issued to the other attorney.

The respondent’s motion does not explain exactly when the respondent retained his current counsel. Although the respondent’s affidavit states that, after the Board’s decision dismissing his appeal, “[w]e found a lawyer right before the deadline for the appeal” (Motion Exh. A, at 7, ¶ 25), but the meaning of this phrase is not clear.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Zamudio Marin, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(B)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(I)] - Nonimmigrant - no valid passport
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 09, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s February 17, 2015, motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on December 3, 2014, pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A) (I.J. at 1-3). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). We write separately to supplement the Immigration Judge’s decision with a few additional points, in light of the respondent’s appeal. First, the respondent acknowledges that she had actual notice for the December 3, 2014, hearing (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 9). Second, the respondent claims in her declaration that she relied on the advice of a lawyer, whom she characterized as “my lawyer” (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab C), not to appear for the December 3, 2014, hearing. She claims that the lawyer advised her “agent,” who then advised her, that the December 3, 2014, hearing would be “nullified” as a result of her release from custody on November 25, 2014 (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab C).
 
The lawyer tells a different story, however. According to the lawyer’s declaration, he was not retained to represent the respondent at the time the respondent’s agent contacted him about the December 3, 2014, hearing (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab E). Rather, the lawyer’s declaration reflects that he was only retained to represent the respondent in connection with her credible fear interview on October 31, 2014 (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab E). This statement, we note, is corroborated by the fact that the lawyer did not enter an appearance on the respondent’s behalf at the November 24, 2014, master calendar hearing (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tabs C, E).
 
While we have recognized that a lawyer’s affirmative direction not to appear for a scheduled hearing can constitute exceptional circumstances justifying the rescission of an in absentia removal order, such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must comply with the requirements delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 In this case, the respondent has not set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her former counsel, and in fact, the record shows that representation in these proceedings was not within the scope of the attorney-client agreement. Nor has a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities against the respondent’s former counsel; the respondent, in fact, has not even acknowledged the existence of this requirement (Respondent’s M.T.R. at 2-3). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000) (recognizing that Lozada’s “requirement regarding disciplinary allegations served both to deter meritless claims and to aid in policing the immigration bar” (citing Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639)).
 
Insofar as the respondent has not established a viable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, she has not established exceptional circumstances warranting rescission of the in absentia removal order. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated March 17, 2014, denying his motion to reopen. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. These removal proceedings were completed when, on October 28, 2013, the respondent was granted the privilege of voluntarily departure. As such, the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed on February 26, 2014, was untimely (I.J. at 1). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5 (BIA 2001).
 
Inasmuch as the respondent’s request for equitable tolling was not presented to the Immigration Judge, the request is not properly before this Board for the purposes of appellate review. See, e.g., Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 638 (BIA 2003); Matter of Jimenez, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Moreover, the respondent’s generalized references to having pursued his rights diligently, without identifying specific actions that he actually took, do not persuade this Board that equitable tolling would be warranted, had it been properly presented to the Immigration Judge for consideration (Respondent’s Br. at 4-6). See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010) (holding that equitable tolling is warranted only if the movant shows that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing); Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990).
 
Finally, we have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case, including the respondent’s claims to having been provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). Nonetheless, we are not persuaded that he has demonstrated that an exceptional situation exists which would warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 For the reasons set forth above, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul A. Esquivel, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 10, 2014, denying his motion to reopen to apply for asylum under section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1158, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003(d)(3).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was granted post-conclusion voluntary departure on May 7, 2013, to depart on or before September 4, 2013. On December 16, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel and he did not establish prima facie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or for protection under the Convention Against Torture (I.J. at 2).
 
On appeal, counsel for the respondent states that he has attempted to obtain the necessary information from the respondent’s two previous attorneys to determine whether he can proceed with a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but he has not been provided the file from either of the attorneys. The respondent indicates that he is attempting to compile the necessary evidence for a viable non-frivolous complaint, and that he will submit supplements, including a completed complaint with the proper agencies upon accumulation of evidence. To date, the respondent has not submitted any additional evidence in support of his claim that he would be pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and he has not complied with the procedural requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not submitted evidence that he has notified his former attorney of his ineffective assistance allegations; and there is no evidence that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority. Matter of Lozada, supra. Consequently, the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening due to his fear of returning to Mexico, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established changed circumstances or changed country conditions to warrant reopening of proceedings. The respondent was represented by counsel when he requested and was granted voluntary departure, after being fully advised of the consequences if he failed to depart. The alleged failure of former counsel to inform the respondent of the availability of asylum, withholding of removal, and of protection under the Convention Against Torture does not create “changed country conditions” or “previously unavailable evidence” when the basis for the asylum claim arose before the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 7, 2013. The respondent’s fear of harm could have been presented at his previous hearing. There also has been no prima facie showing that upon return to Mexico the respondent would face torture by or with the consent or acquiescence of government officials (to include the concept of willful blindness) for the purposes of the CAT. In light of the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted to consider his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a)(1). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Despite the respondent’s claim that he has been unable to obtain an audio recording of his underlying removal proceedings, we decline to order a transcript of these proceedings to be prepared or further extend the briefing schedule in this matter. A transcript is not ordinarily prepared where a motion to reopen is filed, since the motion will be decided on the basis of its merits rather than on the basis of a review of the record. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (noting transcript ordinarily not present when motion to reopen filed).

IN RE: MANDEEP SINGH
File: AXXX XX6 739 - Harlingen, TX
June 12, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eileen Collins Bretz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 8, 2011, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal in absentia, and on January 17, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), 1003.26. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision on May 9, 2013. This case was last before the Board on July 26, 2013, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our decision. The respondent has now filed another motion to reopen the removal proceedings to rescind the in absentia order of removal to enable him to apply for asylum and withholding of removal. The motion will be denied.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent failed to appear at his scheduled removal hearing. The respondent, however, now raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Norma Sepulveda, Esquire, who represented him before the Immigration Judge. He also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Laura Perez, Esquire, who filed his motion to reopen and rescind with the Immigration Judge, and his appeal and motion to reconsider with the Board, for failing to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Attorney Sepulveda.
 
The respondent has attempted to comply with the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). He has not, however, shown that prior counsel rendered deficient performance resulting in prejudice. Id. See also Miranda-Lores v. I.N.S., 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (“To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show (1) ineffective representation and (2) substantial prejudice, which occurred as a result of the ineffective representation”); Ogbemudia v. I.N.S., 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993).
 
The respondent alleges that Attorney Sepulveda did not properly inform him of the consequences of the failure to appear, and did not provide him with notice of the removal hearing. The Notice to Appear, however, reveals that on June 15, 2011, the respondent was provided oral notice in the Punjabi language of the consequences of the failure to appear. See Exhibit 1. The record further reveals that notice of the November 8, 2011, hearing, was properly served on the respondent’s counsel, Attorney Sepulveda, who in response to the allegations against her, claims that she attempted to contact the respondent to no avail at his address of record, i.e., the address provided by his bond obligor. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (recognizing that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5 (notice of hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is sufficient notice). Indeed, the respondent states in the instant motion that “[a]lthough (he) had contact with his bond obligor, his bond obligor did not notify him of his hearing until he received notice from ICE requesting that he deliver (the respondent) at a set time and date.” See Respondent’s Motion at 5. Given this record, it has not been shown that the respondent’s failure to appear at his removal hearing was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Attorney Sepulveda. As the respondent has not shown ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Attorney Sepulveda, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Attorney Perez lacks merit and will not be considered further.
 
*2 In sum, we are not persuaded to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order based on the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Further, as previously found, the respondent has not shown that his failure to appear at the November 8, 2011, removal hearing was the result of “exceptional circumstances” as defined at section 240(e)(1) of the Act. We also are not persuaded to reopen these proceedings to enable the respondent to apply for asylum and related relief as he has not set forth a claim of materially changed circumstances or conditions in his native country, India. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Finally, the respondent has not set forth a case of exceptional circumstances warranting reopening in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

June 12, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brenna Torres, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s June 9, 2014, decision that denied his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The record before us does not contain a brief from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that he did not receive proper notice for the October 6, 2000, hearing. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge.1 The respondent does not submit a sworn affidavit or an unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury, or satisfactorily explain why not. Leaving aside the “false name” issue, the respondent was obligated to provide to the Immigration Court an address at which he may be contacted regarding removal proceedings, and also promptly provide any change of address (Notice to Appear (Form I-862)). See sections 239(a)(1) and (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1) and (2). The respondent’s 2000 Federal income tax return (Motion Exh. G, at 73-75) was filed listing a Southampton, New York, address, and the W-2 lists an East Hampton, New York, address. He does not provide any evidence to show that he was living at the New York, New York, address [provided in his motion to change venue and provided for the Notice to EOIR: Alien Address (Form I-830)] during June of 2000 when the notice of hearing was sent.
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (Gary Ortega), he does not satisfy any of the three requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to properly make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent requested reopening and administrative closure of his case. We look to the factors discussed in Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012). The reasons administrative closure is sought are not persuasive. The respondent can apply to the DHS for prosecutorial discretion without these proceedings being administratively closed, and voluntary departure is not a new form of relief. The DHS opposed the motion to reopen on the merits. Even if the respondent pursues prosecutorial discretion, he has not shown a likelihood of success. The delay from October of 2000 until March of 2014 is due to the respondent. He does not show that there would be a different ultimate outcome when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board. The factors in Matter of Avetisyan, supra, weigh against administrative closure.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We do not affirm one portion of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The DHS alleged in its opposition that the respondent had one arrest, and the Immigration Judge observed in his decision that the respondent did not respond to the allegation. However, the DHS did not submit any evidence of the arrest, and he now submits a certificate of disposition [which does not warrant a remand] which shows that the criminal record was sealed.

June 12, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ramiro Alcazar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 10, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and ordered him removed. The respondent challenges denial of a continuance and challenges removability on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was placed in proceedings on April 5, 2012. His first hearing was on May 14, 2012. He was granted a continuance to find an attorney (Tr. at 13). His second hearing was on September 10, 2012. He was granted a continuance for attorney preparation (Tr. at 15). On December 3, 2012, the respondent (through counsel) said he is not “Rafael Martinez,” denied all the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear (NTA), denied the charges of removability, and indicated that he intended to file a motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings. The Immigration Judge granted him a continuance to file that motion (Tr. at 19-21; Exhs. 2, 4-5).
 
On February 14, 2013, the respondent (through counsel) withdrew the motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings and withdrew his objection to consideration of the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213), excepting the name of the respondent (Tr. at 48-50, 58-60, 63-66, 80, 94; I.J. at 2-3). On March 7, 2013, after the NTA was amended to add the respondent’s true name, the respondent admitted proper service of the NTA, admitted the factual allegations, conceded removability, designated Mexico for removal, and requested voluntary departure (Tr. at 58-60, 63-66; Exh. 6; I.J. at 2-3). The respondent was then granted continuances to pursue Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and prosecutorial discretion (Tr. at 67-69; I.J. at 2; Exhs. 7-8). On March 10, 2014, the respondent indicated that DACA and prosecutorial discretion had been denied (Tr. at 73-74, 79, 92, 96-97; I.J. at 2).
 
The respondent (through counsel) then indicated that he was not seeking voluntary departure or other relief, indicated that he was amending the pleadings again to deny that proper service of the NTA was made and to deny the charges of removability, and he requested another continuance (Tr. at 97-98, 100-101; I.J. at 2-3). The Immigration Judge denied that request (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge found removability proved, regardless of the pleadings, based on the Form I-213 (Exh. 3) and ordered the respondent removed (I.J. at 3-4).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent1 challenges denial of the continuance. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We agree that the respondent did not show good cause for another continuance.
 
Also on appeal, the respondent disputes removability. The respondent attempts to raise on appeal the issues raised in the motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings that he voluntarily withdrew before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 48-50, 58-60, 63-66, 80, 94; I.J. at 2-3). The respondent argues that, despite the withdrawal of the motion, despite his withdrawal of objection to the Form I-213, despite his admission of the factual allegations and despite his concession of removability, he is not, in fact, removable. We find, however, that the prior withdrawal of the motion, withdrawal of objection to the Form I-213, admissions of fact, and concessions of removability are binding on the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal concession made by counsel is binding on the alien). Cf. Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that facts admitted by a party are “judicial admissions” that bind that party throughout the litigation). Moreover, we note that the respondent does not assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles H. Kuck, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sirce E. Owen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on March 12, 2015, when we denied the respondent’s untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion does not convince us that reconsideration of our previous decision is warranted. A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent largely raises the same or similar arguments in the motion to reconsider as were raised in his prior motion to reopen. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we determined that the respondent had not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and denied his motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal...”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient.
 
To the extent that the respondent is attempting to raise new arguments related to his compliance with the requirements laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec, 637 (BIA 1988), these arguments are not properly raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider. See O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied” and “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) (citation omitted). A motion to reconsider is neither a vehicle for advancing supplemental legal arguments that could have been previously raised nor a mechanism for submitting a late-filed brief. Moreove, the respondent did not file his bar complaint until after the Board issued its March 12, 2015, decision, finding that the respondent did not substantially comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. Regardless, none of the arguments or evidence presented, including the response from the respondent’s prior counsel, Mr. Fogel, convinces us of error in our ultimate determination that the respondent has not established prejudice by any actions or inactions of his former counsel (Motion at Tab I). Therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Royal F. Berg, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 7, 2014, denial of his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s requests for oral argument, and en banc or 3-member panel review, are denied.
 
The Board reviews Immigration Judges’ findings of fact, including credibility determinations, for clear error, and we review all other matters on appeal de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
“A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Here, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as the respondent did not satisfy the requirements of reopening. See Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
There is no question that the evidence was previously available. The respondent could have presented the evidence at the former hearing, but did not do so because he expressed no concerns about returning to Guatemala. Since the respondent did not comply with the requirements of reopening, the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion.
 
In addition, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the DHS considered the respondent’s request for prosecutorial discretion and denied the request. Neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board, has authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in the respondent’s case. See Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281, 284 (BIA 1998). A request for prosecutorial discretion is a collateral matter, and the Immigration Judge did not need to continue the proceedings to allow the respondent to make such a request to the DHS. See generally Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982) (explaining that prosecutorial discretion is a function of the DHS; and that it was not error for the Immigration Judge to decline to continue the hearing for the alien to apply for a form of prosecutorial discretion for his or her case). Moreover, the respondent has not shown he was prejudiced by the continuance denial, as he has not shown he has been granted prosecutorial discretion by DHS; nor has he shown that he is eligible for any forms of relief from removal. See Bathula v. Holder, 723 F.3d 889, 903 n. 34 (7th Cir. 2013); Rapheal v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 521, 533 (7th Cir. 2008).
 
*2 The respondent contends that his due process rights were violated because, inter alia, he may not have been adequately advised regarding his avenues of relief. We disagree. In order to establish a denial of the right to due process, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s actions. See Hasanaj v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 780, 785 (7th Cir. 2004); Wigglesworth v. INS, 319 F.3d 951, 960 (7th Cir. 2003). Here, the respondent was represented by counsel at his last two hearings and a Spanish interpreter was provided at all hearings. The motion was properly denied because while the respondent provided his statement and his Form I-589 application, the respondent did not establish that the alleged facts were new and previously unavailable. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3).
 
We also find without merit the respondent’s contention that he should have been able to withdraw pleadings. See generally Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (a respondent is bound by the tactical decisions made by his counsel). The respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; nor has he complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent requests a transcription of the proceedings. The request is denied. Normally, a transcription of the hearing is not ordered from the appeal of a denial of a motion to reopen. If a review of the record indicates that transcription is important to adjudicate the appeal, the transcript will be ordered. Here, we are not persuaded that a transcript is necessary to resolve this appeal, because the digital audio recording of the hearing is available. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: WAYNE LEWIS
File: AXXX XX9 875 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Audrey A. Thomas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s September 9, 2014, decision which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). In determining whether exceptional circumstances exist to excuse an alien’s failure to appear, the “totality of circumstances” pertaining to the alien’s case must be considered. Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear on October 28, 2008 (Exh. 1). On November 6, 2008, the respondent appeared, conceded removability as charged in the Notice to Appear, and indicated his intention to apply for adjustment of status. On September 23, 2009, he failed to appear and was ordered removed in absentia. On November 2, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which was granted. On September 15, 2010, he appeared with counsel who requested a continuance which was granted, and the matter was reset until September 29, 2010. He failed to appear on September 29, 2010, reportedly because he experienced a panic attack after seeing immigration officers and departed the building. The Immigration Judge adjourned the matter until October 1, 2010.
 
*2 Following a hearing conducted in absentia on October 1, 2010, at which the respondent failed to appear and the Department of Homeland Security (DBS) presented evidence, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged in the Notice to Appear, and ordered him removed from the United States.2 See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. His counsel appeared and indicated that she did not know the respondent’s location. She requested to withdraw as counsel in February 2011.
 
On April 29, 2014, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. He alleged that he did not appear on October 1, 2010, because his attorney did not inform him of the October 1, 2010, hearing date, that he was experiencing financial difficulties, and essentially was homeless at the time. The respondent indicated that he did not attempt to contact his previous attorney because he owed her legal fees and believed that she would not speak to him.
 
The DHS filed a response in opposition to the motion to reopen, noting that the motion failed to address why the respondent did not appear on September 29, 2010, and did not offer any medical evidence to excuse his failure to appear. In addition, the DHS observed that notice to the respondent’s attorney for the hearings on September 29, and October 1, 2010, constituted effective notice to him, and that he had not filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney.
 
On September 9, 2014, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to rescind the in absentia removal order because the respondent had failed to explain why he did not appear on September 29, 2010. She noted that his prior counsel had informed her on September 29, 2010, that the respondent did not appear because he had a panic attack after seeing immigration officers at the Immigration Court and had visited an emergency clinic. However, the respondent had not submitted any medical evidence to support this contention with his motion to reopen (I.J. at 3). In addition, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and had failed to establish due diligence by waiting almost 4 years to file a motion to reopen with any explanation for the delay (Id.). Finally, the Immigration Judge determined that notice to the respondent’s counsel for the October 1, 2010, hearing constituted effective notice to him, and that he had not established exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear (I.J. at 4).
 
The respondent submitted a Notice of Appeal which contained a short statement of reasons which alleged without elaboration that the Immigration Judge erred in her decision. His brief claimed that he was sick on September 29, 2010, and was vomiting, dizzy and had diarrhea. However, the brief does not address why he did not appear on October 1, 2010, and it does not reiterate the contention made in the motion to reopen that he failed to appear because his attorney did not inform him of the hearing date. Although he filed a brief, he requested and received an extension of the filing deadline to submit a supplemental brief with medical evidence. His request for a second extension was denied. He has not submitted any medical evidence to date.
 
*3 The respondent does not contest that he is subject to removal as charged, and he does not allege any error in the Immigration Judge’s decision that he failed to establish that his in absentia deportation order should be rescinded. In addition, his brief on appeal indicates that he did not appear because he was sick, which contradicts the claim in his motion that he did not appear because his prior attorney did not inform him of the hearing date.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Service of the Notice of Hearing on the alien’s representative is proper. Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to alien’s counsel constitutes notice to alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent has not established that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of a lack of notice because his prior attorney received proper notice of the hearing. Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based upon her unsuccessful communications with attorney about hearing date did not establish exceptional circumstances where she failed to satisfy all of requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
To the extent that the respondent claimed that his prior attorney (who represents him on appeal) purportedly did not tell him he had a hearing on October 1, 2010, this allegation, without more, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, especially in light of the respondent’s concession that he did not remain in contact with his attorney. In addition, the respondent could have contacted the Immigration Court directly. Furthermore, he has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not filed a state bar complaint.
 
Moreover, for the reasons stated in the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent did not establish that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of exceptional circumstances, as required by section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act. See also Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1998) (“twisted foot” does not constitute exceptional circumstance); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (strong headache did not constitute exceptional circumstance). See also Cabrera v. Gonzales, 229 Fed. Appx. 483 (9th Cir. 2007) (stomach infection, diarrhea and abdominal pain did not constitute exceptional circumstances or serious illness sufficient to merit reopening of in absentia order). To the extent that the respondent alleges that his panic attack on September 29, 2010, constituted an exceptional circumstance to excuse his failure to appear, he has not provided any medical evidence to substantiate his claim, or alleged that a panic attack on September 29, 2010, also was the reason he failed to appear on October 1, 2010. In addition, he failed to address or explain, either in his motion or on appeal, why he waited almost 4 years to file his motion to reopen.
 
*4 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent has filed a request for a stay of removal. Given our disposition in this order the stay of removal is moot.

2

On April 7, 2010, the DHS filed lodged charges under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), alleging that the respondent had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. On September 9, 2014, the Immigration Judge did not sustain this charge because the DHS had not submitted evidence of the record of conviction for one of the convictions (I.J. at 2).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ARMANDO RAMIREZ-CASTANEDA1
File: AXXX XX9 596 - York, PA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elizabeth M. Trinidad, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William E. Lore
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the April 25, 2013, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings.2 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requests summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge did not consider Leslie v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 611 F.3d 171 (3d Cir. 2010), or certain defects in the Notice to Appeal. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge’s findings of fact and analysis support his conclusion that the respondent did not satisfy his burden of proof as it relates to his motion to reopen (I.J. at 2-3).
 
Citing Leslie v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge committed reversible error, as there is no evidence that the Immigration Judge gave him a pro bono list of legal service providers (Resp. Br. at 5, 7-10). We disagree. The respondent does not deny that he was personally served with the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) (Form I-862) or that the NTA bears his signature. While the respondent argues that he may have been in deportation proceedings, the Immigration Judge found that “the original and only charging document in this case was a Notice to Appear, Form I-862, and dated February 17, 1998” (I.J. at 2). Further, the Immigration Judge reasonably noted that the NTA’s Certificate of Service indicates that the “respondent was provided the pro bono list” (I.J. at 2, n.2).
 
A motion to reopen may not be granted, unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880, 884 (BIA 1994). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (“Third Circuit”), in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has found that “the prima facie case standard for a motion to reopen . . . requires the applicant to produce objective evidence showing a ‘reasonable likelihood’ that he or she can establish” entitlement to relief. Guo v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 556, 563 (3d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). Moreover, the Third Circuit has explained that “[p]rima facie scrutiny entails consideration of ‘the evidence that accompanies the motion as well as relevant evidence that may exist in the record of the prior hearing, in light of the applicable statutory requirements for relief.”DD’ Id. at 563 n.7 (citation omitted).
 
*2 The respondent has not established that these proceedings should be reopened on account of lack of proper notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent argues on appeal that the NTA may not have been signed by someone authorized to do so (Resp. Br. at 6, 12-13). However, as the respondent has not shown that any statute or regulation prohibits another immigration officer from signing on behalf of the issuing officer listed on the Notice to Appear, it follows that he has not shown that it constitutes a violation of a regulation. In addition, there is a presumption that public officers, including DHS employees, properly discharge their duties. See U. S. v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (citations omitted).
 
On this record, the respondent’s argument is insufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity. There is also no evidence that the respondent was prejudiced by the alleged defect in the Notice to Appear. The Notice to Appear included the allegations and charge against him and the alleged defect in the Notice to Appear did not prejudice the respondent because it did not interfere with his understanding of the charge against him or his ability to respond to that charge. See e.g., Kohli v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding the Board complied with the regulations that vest jurisdiction in the Immigration Court and the alleged defect in the NTA did not deprive the Immigration Court of jurisdiction).
 
We concur with the Immigration Judge that the NTA was not defective for lacking the date, time, and place of the hearing (I.J. at 2). The respondent asserts that the NTA contravenes section 239(a)(1)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1129(a)(1)(G) because the form itself does not state the date, time and place for the commencement of proceedings (Resp. Br. at 12-14). The respondent maintains that the NTA is thus defective. Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, the absence of a specific date, time, and place for the initial removal hearing in the NTA does not render it “defective” (Resp. Br. at 12-14). See Matter of Camarillo, 25 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 2011). As noted in Matter of Camarillo, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b) permits the NTA to include such scheduling information “where practicable.” The Immigration Judge reasonably determined that the respondent’s arguments are also undercut by the subsequent notice of hearing sent to the respondent’s counsel of record (I.J. at 2). Popa v. Holder, 571 F.3d 890 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that a NTA that failed to include a date or time of alien’s deportation hearing but states that a date and time will be set later, is not defective as long as the notice of hearing is in fact later sent to the alien). In view of the circumstances presented, we are not persuaded by the arguments on appeal that the NTA was defective and jurisdiction was not conferred to the court.
 
*3 Finally, even if the NTA was defective, the violation of a regulation does not necessarily invalidate a removal proceeding. See Matter of Hernandez, 21 I&N Dec. 224, 226 (BIA 1996). Rather, we have held that the violation of a regulatory requirement invalidates a proceeding only where the regulation provides a benefit to the alien and the violation prejudiced the interest of the alien who was to be protected by the regulation. See Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325 (BIA 1996). The respondent does not contend that he is in this country pursuant to a lawful admission and is not subject to removal from the United States, nor does he allege that he is currently eligible for any form of relief from removal. Thus, he has not demonstrated that the regulation provides a benefit to him or that he was prejudiced by the individual signing the NTA.
 
The respondent moves that the proceedings be administratively closed so that he may apply for prosecutorial discretion before the DHS (Resp. Br. at 15-18). See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012) (setting forth the factors to consider in determining whether administrative closure of a proceeding is appropriate even when it is opposed by one of the parties). The exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a matter within the authority of the DHS, not of the Immigration Judge or the Board.3 See Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381, 1391 (BIA 2000) (observing that the DHS has prosecutorial discretion, which includes the discretion to address the equities of individual cases in a manner that the rigid application of a broadly drawn statute often will not allow); see also Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); Matter of Singh, 21 I&N Dec. 427, 435 (BIA 1996); Matter of Yazdani, 17 I&N Dec. 626, 630 (BIA 1981). As a general matter, the DHS is in the best position to assess its own priorities and whether its prosecutorial discretion should be exercised in a particular case. The potential exercise of discretion does not represent an “immigration benefit” over which the Immigration Court or this Board has jurisdiction or to which a respondent may claim entitlement.4 See generally, section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.1(b), (d)(1)(i). The DHS has not joined in the respondent’s motion. Neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction to compel the DHS to exercise prosecutorial discretion which may be granted at any stage of the proceedings. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009) (holding that the Board lacks the authority to reopen a proceeding to allow an alien an opportunity to seek relief from removal if the Board and the Immigration Judge have no authority to grant the requested form of relief, especially where reopening is sought simply as a mechanism to stay the final order while the collateral matter is resolved by the agency or court having jurisdiction to do so).
 
*4 The Immigration Judge did not err in denying the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings. The Immigration Judge only has the authority delegated to him or her by the Attorney General. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.10(b). It is the function of the Immigration Judge to adjudicate the case and not to determine when or whether charges are brought. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(a) and (b); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(a) (authority of the Immigration Judge). The initiation of removal proceedings through the issuance of a Notice to Appear is covered by section 239 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229; see 8 C.F.R. §§ 2.1, 239.2(a) issuance of Notice to Appear). The DHS, not an Immigration Judge, has prosecutorial discretion to commence proceedings. Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381, 1391 (BIA 2000) (INS has unreviewable prosecutorial discretion); Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982). Further, section 240 of the Act confers prosecutorial discretion upon the DHS to commence proceedings, and once proceedings have been commenced, it is the responsibility of the Immigration Judge to adjudicate them. See Matter of Lujan-Quintana, 25 I&N Dec. 53, 56 (BIA 2009) (“DHS has inherent flexibility, in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, to pursue removal of an alien in either expedited removal proceedings or proceedings under section 240 of the Act.”); see also Matter of Bahta, supra; Matter of G-N-C-, supra; Matter of Quintero, supra.
 
The respondent’s motion does not present “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen his proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Having considered the respondent’s appellate contentions (Resp. Br. at 15-18), reopening and administrative closure is also not warranted because we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988). Under these circumstances, administrative closure of the proceedings is not warranted under Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
*5 We acknowledge that enforcement of the removal order may result in hardship to the respondent and family members. However, the Immigration Judge and the Board do not have jurisdiction to fashion equitable remedies or grant general humanitarian relief. See Matter of Medina, supra.
 
In general, motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days from the date “on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings sought to be reopened,” see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); see also section 240(c)(7)(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C), although this time limit is subject to equitable tolling. Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011). The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reopen was filed more than 90 days after the administratively final decision. Rather, he argues that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by refusing to equitably toll the 90-day time limitation for filing a motion to reopen on the basis of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Br. at 14-15).
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel can serve as a basis for equitable tolling, but it must be substantiated and accompanied by a showing of due diligence. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, All F.3d 248, 252 (3d Cir. 2005). An alien seeking to equitably toll the limitation period based on ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence in raising the claim, and that prejudice resulted from counsel’s alleged errors. Mahmood v. Gonzales, supra, at 251-52; Fadiga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 142, 159 (3d Cir. 2007). Prejudice requires an alien to show that there was a “reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different if the error[s] ... had not occurred.” Fadiga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 159. “Periods of unaccounted-for delay reveal a lack of diligence.” Mahmood v. Gonzales, supra, at 253; see also Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 90 (“Due diligence must be exercised over the entire period for which tolling is desired.”). “This includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra. The failure to exercise due diligence in asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel undermines any claim for equitable tolling. “Equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.” Mahmood v. Gonzales, supra, at 253 (quoting Hedges v. U.S., 404 F.3d 744, 751 (3d Cir. 2005)).
 
*6 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s “““assertions of counsel ineffectiveness are without merit” (I.J. at 2). On this record, the respondent has not demonstrated compliance with the procedural requirements for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988).5 The Third Circuit has adopted Lozada’s procedural requirements, but strict compliance is not always required. Pajow v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 515 F.App’x 119, 121 (3d Cir. 2013) (unpublished); Rranci v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 540 F.3d 165, 172-74 (3d Cir. 2008). Having considered the respondent’s appellate contentions, we conclude that he has not demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra (Resp. Br. at 7, 14-15). Moreover, the respondent has not accounted for the period of delay in pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
To the extent the respondent asserts a due process violation, we are unpersuaded. On this record, the respondent has not shown that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent due process of law by denying his motion to reopen. The respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for a form of relief that either the Immigration Judge or the Board has the authority to grant. Moreover, although the Immigration Judge did not discuss every piece of evidence referred to by the respondent, he did consider the relevant evidence of record. Huang v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 620 F.3d 372, 388 (3d Cir. 2010) (finding that Immigration Judges need not discuss every piece of evidence mentioned by an asylum applicant). We do not conclude that the respondent was in any way prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s handling of her case, or that the hearing was unfair and violated due process. See Delgado-Sobalvarro v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 625 F.3d 782, 787 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Khan v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., supra, at 236; Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982).
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge abandoned his impartial role. An Immigration Judge has the authority to “““interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien” in removal proceedings. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1). See generally Matter of Rhee, 16 I&N Dec. 607 (BIA 1978). Due process requires the alien be afforded a full and fair hearing; however, an Immigration Judge has broad discretion in how he conducts that hearing. See generally Romanishyn v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 455 F.3d 175, 185 (3d Cir. 2006); Khan v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 448 F.3d 226, 236 (3d Cir. 2006); Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 587, 596 (3d Cir. 2003). We have reviewed the record and find no basis to conclude that the Immigration Judge was biased or that the Immigration Judge’s questioning or comments in any way exceeded judicial bounds. See Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 556 (1994); Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, supra, at 597; cf. Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11 (1954) (finding that the record reveals an attitude inconsistent with the restraints of conventional judicial demeanor).
 
*7 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Footnotes

1

On appeal, the respondent indicates through counsel that the variations of his name, “Armando Ramirez-Castaneda” and “Armando Ramirez-Costaneda” that appear throughout these proceedings are incorrect (Resp. Br. at 2, 22).

2

The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent, through previous counsel, filed a motion to stay removal in conjunction with a motion to reopen proceedings, and on March 28, 2013, the Immigration Court denied the stay request and did not address the underlying motion to reopen (I.J. at 1).

3

The authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases lies solely with the DHS as the federal agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of federal immigration law. See section 103(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a); see also Beltranena v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 555 F.App’x 198, 201 (3d Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (same); Patel v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 523 F.App’x 121, 124 (3d Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (same). A request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion may be directed to the DHS. See Matter of Garcia, 21 I&N Dec. 254, 260 (BIA 1996) (finding in relevant part that the decision to institute removal proceedings involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and is one which neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board reviews).

4

If the DHS elects to grant the respondent an immigration benefit as a matter of prosecutorial discretion in the future, the parties are not precluded from filing a joint motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii).

5

Pursuant to Lozada, the movant is required to submit to the Board: (1) an affidavit “attesting to the relevant facts,” (2) a report of counsel’s response or failure to respond to the allegations, and (3) information regarding whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, supra.

IN RE: LESY ERENIO SANCHEZ-MATUTE
File: AXXX XX8 848 - San Antonio, TX
May 14, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paula J. Ferreira, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 7, 2014, decision denying her motion to reopen. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on July 8, 2013. The appeal will be sustained, the proceedings reopened and the record remanded.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent claimed in her motion to reopen that exceptional circumstances prevented her from attending her July 8, 2013, removal hearing (Resp. Mot. to Reopen at 3-6). Specifically, respondent, through counsel, asserted that her attorney advised her that her pending motion to change venue would be granted and she was not required to attend the hearing; and also that her counsel suffered a computer virus that made his calendar inaccessible (Resp. Mot. to Reopen at 3-6). The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that the mere existence of a pending motion to change venue did not relieve the respondent of her duty to attend the hearing, and that the computer virus did not amount to exceptional circumstances (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent, through the same counsel, maintains her claim of exceptional circumstances and further asserts that she is not required to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), because she is not claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, only that counsel’s incorrect advice constitutes an exceptional circumstance (Resp. Br. at 7).
 
The respondent is correct that both this Board and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, have found that the erroneous advice of counsel may constitute an exceptional circumstance excusing the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (1996); see also Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798 (5th Cir. 2007). However, in such a scenario, substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is still required.1 See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496-98 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Hernandez-Ortez v.

*2 Based on the totality of the circumstances in this case, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind her in absentia order pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.

In Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, supra, and Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, supra, each of the respondents were represented by new counsel and had already complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. See Galvez-Vergara, supra, at 800, 800 n.2; see also Grijalva-Barrera, supra, at 473-74. Here, the respondent is represented by the same counsel who incorrectly advised her on her need to appear for the hearing and has not filed any complaint regarding this conduct. Further, it appears counsel still has not advised the respondent regarding the need to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra.

IN RE: MUSTAPHA JALLOW A.K.A. MUSTAHPA GALLOW
File: AXXX XX3 922 - Baltimore, MD
May 12, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stuart A. Yeager, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)] - Inadmissible at time of entry
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary Departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of The Gambia, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s April 24, 2014, decision. That decision found the respondent subject to removal as charged, but granted post-hearing voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The respondent submitted a brief concerning the Immigration Judge’s decision, while the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) did not respond to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). All other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, we review de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The respondent’s case arises after May 11, 2005, and is therefore governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act.
 
The respondent’s sole argument on appeal is that the Immigration Judge erred by not granting 120 days’ pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act. However, at the April 24, 2014, removal hearing, counsel for the respondent said that the respondent was seeking post-hearing voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act (Tr. at 24). This was after the Immigration Judge noted that a respondent cannot seek pre-conclusion voluntary departure unless the individual waives the right to appeal to this Board. Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000)(voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act requires a waiver of the right to appeal); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(D); Tr. at 24. The respondent makes no claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him at the removal hearing. The appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. The period of voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act will, therefore, be reinstated.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edwin T Gania, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Geoffrey P. Gilpin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; adjustment of status
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 17, 2013, ordering him removed after denying his request for a continuance. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent 2 continuances prior to his final hearing (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 9-11, 21-24). In denying the respondent’s request for yet another continuance, the Immigration Judge considered the factors outlined in Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009), and Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009) (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6; Matter of Villarreal-Zuniga, 23 I&N Dec. 886, 891 (BIA 2006). The Immigration Judge specifically considered the respondent’s lengthy residence and family ties in this country, and other positive factors such as his business and ownership of rental properties (I.J. at 3-4). The Immigration Judge also considered the DHS’s opposition to any further continuances based on the respondent’s criminal record and his undesirability as a permanent resident (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge determined that even if the underlying visa petition were approved, the respondent did not warrant adjustment of status as a matter of discretion (I.J. at 4-5). Pawlowska v. Holder, 623 F.3d 1138, 1140-41 (7th Cir. 2010) (where Immigration Judge denied a continuance based on the conclusion that he would ultimately deny adjustment of status as a discretionary matter).
 
Although the underlying visa petition has since been approved (Respondent’s Brief, Exh. A), we find no basis to remand this matter, or to otherwise disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision, as we agree that the respondent has not demonstrated that he warrants adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge properly weighed and balanced the factors relevant to the exercise of discretion in this case. Although the respondent has many equities and his removal will result in some hardship, as described by the Immigration Judge and the. respondent on appeal (Respondent’s Brief at 5-9), he also has an extensive history of drinking and driving, which the Immigration Judge properly considered as a significant negative factor. Matter of Teixeira, 21 I&N Dec. 316, 321 (BIA 1996) (evidence of criminal activity should be considered in discretionary determinations). The Immigration Judge did not clearly err in finding the respondent’s repeated drank driving violations were serious and that the respondent was a danger to society (I.J. at 5). Portillo-Rendon v. Holder, 662 F.3d 815, 816 (7th Cir. 2011) (finding that the alien exhibited a “disdain for the rules that govern the use of automobiles. Driving while intoxicated or without a license reflects both indifference to the welfare of other drivers and pedestrians and defiance of known legal obligations.”). The respondent’s repeated disregard for the welfare of others demonstrates a pattern of knowingly placing others at risk of harm. For the reasons discussed above and by the Immigration Judge we agree that the respondent’s positive equities are outweighed by the negative factors, and that the respondent has failed to carry his burden of proving that he merits adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. Id; Matter of Blas, 15 I&N Dec. 626, 628-30 (BIA 1974; A.G. 1976); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970).
 
While we sympathize with the respondent’s family members, who will undoubtedly experience some hardship in connection with his removal, our overriding obligation is to safeguard the interests of the United States, and not just those of the respondent and those close to him.
 
Although the respondent argues that his former counsel’s inadequate preparation negatively impacted his case (Respondent’s Brief at 3-5), he has failed to meet the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). For example, the respondent has not provided an affidavit setting forth his agreement with former counsel, has not shown that former counsel was given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority. Matter of Lozada, supra. Further, he has not established prejudice. Apouviepseakoda v. Gonzales, 475 F.3d 881, 885 (7th Cir. 2007) (alien must establish prejudice before court would vacate the agency’s decision); Boci v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 762, 768 (7th Cir. 2007) (alien cannot prevail without showing that granting a continuance likely would have affected the result of the hearing). Additionally, the respondent’s disagreement with the Immigration Judge’s decision does not render his conduct a violation of due process (Respondent’s Brief at 3-5). See Khan v. Filip, 554 F.3d 681, 689 (7th Cir. 2009); Zamora-Mallari v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 679, 694 (7th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Johanna K. Dennis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 14, 2015. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction. The record will be remanded.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Notice to Appear alleges that, on October 31, 2013, the respondent was convicted of Robbery - Threat of Immediate Physical Injury, in violation of Pennsylvania law, and sentenced to 11.5 months to 23 months in prison. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings (Exh. 2(C)). See section 240(c)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction (Tr. at 6). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 6-7). The respondent does not expressly challenge this finding on appeal.
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony involving theft (Exh. 1). The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 7).1 The respondent does not expressly challenge this finding on appeal.
 
On appeal, the respondent indicates he was denied his right to counsel and received insufficient time to hire an attorney to represent him in removal proceedings.
 
Respondents in immigration proceedings have the statutory and regulatory “““privilege of being represented” by counsel of their choice at no expense to the Government. See sections 240(b)(4)(A), 292 of the Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.16(b), 1240.3, 1240.11(c)(1)(iii). Where the statutory and regulatory privilege of legal representation is not expressly waived, in order to meaningfully effectuate the privilege, the Immigration Judge must grant a reasonable and realistic amount of time and provide a fair opportunity for a respondent to seek, speak with, and retain counsel. See Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888, 889-890 (BIA 2012). See also sections 239(a)(1)(E) and 239(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1)(E), (b)(1).
 
*2 We note that, on November 12, 2014, the Immigration Judge did advise the respondent of his rights concerning representation, provided him a list of free and low cost attorneys, and granted him two months to hire an attorney (Tr. at 2). Moreover, at the final hearing, the respondent said he wished to represent himself (Tr. at 4; I.J. at 1). Because (1) the respondent did not request additional time to seek, speak with, and retain counsel, and (2) the respondent advised the Immigration Judge that he wished to represent himself, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent waived his statutory and regulatory privilege of legal representation. See Matter of C-B-, supra. We agree that the statutory and regulatory privilege of legal representation was waived.
 
On appeal, the respondent also alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction. While he is free to file a motion to vacate his criminal conviction before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010),2 such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
Finally on appeal, the respondent says the Immigration Judge erred in ordering him removed to Vietnam. At the hearing on January 15, 2015, the respondent admitted the allegation in the Notice to Appear that he is a native and citizen of Vietnam (Tr. at 6, 11). However, the Memorandum of Creation of Record of Lawful Permanent Residence in the record indicates that he was born in Thailand and is a citizen of Cambodia (Exh. 2(E) at 54). In light of that, we find it appropriate to remand the record to have the Department of Homeland Security make the appropriate amendment to the Notice to Appear, to have the Immigration Judge reconsider his factual findings concerning the respondent’s country of nativity and country of citizenship, and to reconsider the country of removal.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.

1

However, rather than finding it to be an aggravated felony involving theft, the Immigration Judge refers to the aggravated felony as a crime of violence. On remand, the Immigration Judge should clarify his finding of removal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. __, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jesus Ruiz Velasco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle M. Venci
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; adjustment of status
 
The respondent, a native of Saudi Arabia and a citizen of Pakistan, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2013, decision denying his request for a continuance, finding he had abandoned his application for adjustment of status, and ordering him deported from the United States to Pakistan. During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
The respondent seeks adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), based on an approved immediate relative visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. At the scheduled merits hearing on November 22, 2013, the respondent requested a continuance for several reasons. He had just retained current counsel who had only recently reviewed the record of proceedings. The respondent’s prior counsel had provided current counsel with the respondent’s file just days before the merits hearing. The respondent’s United States citizen wife was taking exams in Pakistan and could not be present at the hearing. And, the respondent had just been indicted for a controlled substance crime and the criminal proceedings were pending. See Respondent’s Motion to Continue.
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not establish good cause for a continuance and denied his motion (Tr. at 33-34). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (a motion to continue may be granted for good cause). She found the continuance motion untimely filed as the written motion was submitted in Court the day of the merits hearing. She determined that the respondent’s current counsel had reviewed the record 2 weeks prior to the hearing and had done nothing to prepare the case, including filing required documents (medical report and affidavit of support) and ensuring the biometrics were complete. She determined that there was no reason to continue based on the respondent’s pending criminal case because the outcome was speculative. She observed that the respondent had been in proceedings since 2009. The Immigration Judge also concluded that because the respondent did not complete the required biometrics, he abandoned his applications for relief (Tr. at 34-35). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(d).
 
*2 During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand premised on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior counsel. We find a remand of the record is warranted in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). The documentation filed in support of the respondent’s motion to remand is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent’s motion is supported by documentation that satisfies the procedural requirements articulated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (holding that an alien making an ineffective assistance claim must: (1) present an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel and representations by counsel in this regard; (2) inform counsel of allegations of ineffective conduct and afford counsel the opportunity to respond, and (3) file a bar complaint or explain the reasons for not doing so).
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agrees that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Lozada, but asserts that the respondent has failed to establish that prior counsel prejudiced his case. See DHS Brief at 9-10. The DHS relies on the finding of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, that the respondent did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that prior counsel violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. See Respondent’s Brief, Exhibit D.
 
However, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, prior counsel stated that he filed a motion to terminate on February 2, 2012, he filed an adjustment application on July 3, 2012, and he prepared and filed all paperwork for which the respondent was eligible. See Respondent’s Brief, Exhibit D. Yet, the record does not contain a motion to terminate. The adjustment application appears to have been incorrectly filed with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). And, the respondent had not updated his biometric information. Although prior counsel represented the respondent for nearly 2 years, the record reveals that the only document he filed was a motion for substitution of counsel.
 
Because the respondent has submitted evidence that has not yet been considered by the Immigration Judge, which potentially bears on her rulings, we will remand the record for further factual findings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating that the Board may not engage in fact finding in the course of deciding appeals except for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (in light of Board’s limited fact-finding ability on appeal, a remand is appropriate when the record is inadequate for review). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Z. Zareefa Escudero, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 4, 2014, denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order entered against him on October 29, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s finding, the digital audio recording (DAR) reveals that the respondent was not present with counsel on April 30, 2013, when the notice of hearing (NOH) for his October 29, 2013, hearing was served on the respondent’s counsel.1 The respondent’s counsel admits that she failed to calendar the respondent’s hearing and she maintains that the respondent’s absence was due to counsel’s failure to communicate to the respondent his October 29, 2013, hearing.
 
Upon de novo review, in light of the totality of circumstances presented in this case, including the respondent’s diligence in seeking reopening, his previous appearances, and his pending citizenship application, we will sustain the appeal and allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing. See Montano-Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008) (ineffective assistance of counsel may qualify as an “exceptional circumstance”).
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

While there is some confusion among the parties whether the Immigration Judge had indeed waived the respondent’s presence, the fact remains that contrary to the Immigration Judge’s finding, the respondent was not present to receive oral or written notice of the October 29, 2013, hearing.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s December 11, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen, which he filed on October 6, 2014. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia on October 23, 2003, for his failure to appear for a scheduled hearing. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In his Motion to Reopen, the respondent challenged the in absentia order of removal, arguing that he did not receive timely notice of the October 23, 2003, hearing because (1) he was not living at the address of record due to a dispute with his aunt, with whom he was living, and (2) he did not receive notice of the hearing from his attorney, who had appeared at a prior hearing on his behalf. The respondent argues both that he did not receive notice of the hearing, and that his failure to appear should be excused based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). The motion to reopen did not contain evidence to support the contentions about a lack of notice or exceptional circumstances, such as an affidavit from the respondent or his aunt, or evidence that the respondent was pursuing any claims against his former attorney, who he alleges failed to provide him with adequate representation and/or a copy of the notice of the hearing. The respondent did provide with his motion copies of the birth certificates of his children and step-daughter, and evidence supporting the medical needs of his step-daughter.
 
In general, only one motion to reopen may be filed to reopen an administratively final order of removal. This must be filed within 90 days of the entry of such order, state new facts that will be proven, and be supported by evidence of those facts. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). A motion to reopen based on a lack of notice under section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act may be filed at any time. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 In her decision denying the motion, the Immigration Judge made the following factual findings, without clear error. First, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent entered as a juvenile1 and was released into the custody of his aunt (I.J. at 1). He appeared at a hearing on February 27, 2003, and admitted the charge of inadmissibility (Id.). A notice resetting the respondent’s hearing until September 18, 2003, was mailed to the respondent in June 2003 to his address of record (his aunt’s home) and to his attorney (I.J. at 1-2). On September 18, 2003, the respondent did not appear but his attorney who was present indicated that he had made attempts to contact the respondent (I.J. at 2). At the attorney’s request, proceedings were continued (I.J. at 2). A notice was personally served on the attorney indicating that the next hearing would occur on October 23, 2003 (Id.). On that date, the attorney appeared and indicated that he had made multiple attempts to contact the respondent, but the respondent again failed to appear and was ordered removed in absentia (Id.). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed some 11 years later, on October 6, 2014 (Id.).
 
Based on the above, we find no cause to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. To the extent that the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances prevented him from attending the September and October 2003 hearings in his immigration proceedings--specifically that he lacked maturity and was in a conflict with his aunt, with whom he was living2--we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the argument was not raised within the requisite 180 days, as set by regulation (I.J. at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Indeed, the respondent did not file his motion for over 10 years after the entry of the in absentia order of removal. Moreover, the respondent bears the burden to establish that exceptional circumstances existed, and he has not met this burden inasmuch as he has not proffered evidence (such as a sworn affidavit from him or his aunt) to show that he was not living at his address of record, and was prevented from accessing his mail. Statements of counsel in a brief or other filing are not evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).3
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that they delay in filing his motion is immaterial because he never received notice of the October 2003 hearing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that this argument is unavailing, in light of the fact that the notice was served on his attorney of record. See I.J. at 2. Service of the notice of hearing on the respondent’s attorney was adequate to reflect that notice was provided under applicable precedent. Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 185 (2001). Although the respondent argues in the motion and on appeal that the attorney did not provide adequate representation and did not provide him with the notice, this claim lacks support. The contention that the attorney only “made one appearance” on the respondent’s behalf, on February 27, 2003, is belied by the fact that the attorney actually appeared twice thereafter when the respondent failed to do so. The respondent has not argued that this finding is clearly erroneous. No affidavit from the respondent avers that the attorney failed to give him notice of the hearing. Indeed, the respondent has not supported any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with, e.g., notice of such a claim to the attorney or applicable state bar office, or by filing an affidavit detailing the agreement between himself and the attorney. Cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*3 We find no cause to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings. As the Immigration Judge noted, the motion lacks evidence to support it. Furthermore, the respondent’s claim that he is eligible to apply for adjustment of status lacks support in the form of evidence that he is the beneficiary of an approved, immediately available visa (I.J. at 4).
 
For the foregoing reasons, the appeal will be dismissed and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent states on appeal that he was 17 years old when he entered the United States in June 2001 (Respondent’s Brief at 2).

2

The respondent also claims that tension arose with his aunt when his then-girlfriend got pregnant and he had to move out to get a full-time job to support his girlfriend and expected child. See Respondent’s Brief at 3. No evidence regarding the birth of this child is part of the record.

We note that even the statements in the motion are vague in this regard, since it is unclear exactly when the respondent stopped residing at his aunt’s home, given his failure to appear for the September 2003 hearing, and the fact that the notice of this hearing was mailed to him in June 2003, just a few months after he provided notice of this address to immigration officials. Therefore, even if they were taken as true, the assertions would not establish exceptional circumstances.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew W. Buck, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 By a decision of an Immigration Judge of November 7, 2013, the motion to reopen filed by the respondent on September 4, 2013, was denied. The respondent appealed.1 The appeal will be dismissed based upon the respondent’s failure to file an appeal brief after stating in his Notice of Appeal that such a brief would be filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). Moreover, the motion asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel however the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements necessary to make such a claim. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988). Although, the respondent has submitted an affidavit, as well as one prepared by a former counsel, no bar complaint has been filed. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that there is insufficient basis to grant the respondent’s motion to reopen. To the extent that the respondent seeks humanitarian relief to enable him to remain in the United States, such relief is to be pursued with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Likewise, any request for relief from removal in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion must also be made to the DHS. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

A notice of withdrawal was filed on February 19, 2014. However, that notice, bearing the name and alien number relating to the respondent, references another person in the body of the notice, and, thus, absent certainty that it relates to the respondent, we disallow withdrawal of the appeal on the basis of the aforenoted notice.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander D. McShiras, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kalin Ivany
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2013, denial of his motion to reopen. The respondent’s request for oral argument will be denied and his appeal will be dismissed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2015).
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent--through counsel--admitted the allegations contained in the Notice to Appear (Exh. 1) and conceded the above charge of removability (I.J. at 1 (citing Exh. 2 (Respondent’s Written Pleadings)). After granting the respondent a continuance on August 23, 2012-- for the adjudication of an I-130 visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife--the Immigration Judge granted his ensuing request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure on January 10, 2013 (i.e., based on his counsel’s statement that the I-130 petition was approved and that the respondent sought voluntary departure so he could adjust status through consular processing) (I.J. at 1-2). See I.J.’s January 10, 2013, Order; see also I.J. at 2-3 (noting that the respondent, despite being informed in Spanish of the consequences of failing to comply with his voluntary departure order, stayed in the country beyond April 10, 2013, the last day in which he could depart while still complying with the Immigration Judge’s Order). The respondent claims in his motion to reopen--which was filed on May 16, 2013-- that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because his prior attorney denied him a reasonable opportunity to present his applications for adjustment of status and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”). See Respondent’s Motion at 7-16.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion. On appeal, the respondent takes issue with the Immigration Judge’s decision that he did not comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in filing a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 3). Despite the respondent’s varied contentions on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 9-14), he has shown no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that he did not meet Lozada’s requirements because he “submitted no independent evidence of having informed [his prior counsel] Mr. De Pedro of the allegations against him” (I.J. at 3).1 See Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003) (in order to assert an ineffective assistance claim, an alien must comply with the Board’s Lozada requirements). Nonetheless, even assuming that the respondent satisfied Lozada’s requirements as he contends, he has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly held that the respondent’s motion was filed beyond the 90-day filing period and is therefore untimely (I.J. at 3). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final order of removal, which in this case was January 10, 2013). In this regard, while equitable tolling may permit reopening beyond the above time limit when an alien shows that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel--and was prejudiced as a result--we see no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent “““does not merit equitable tolling because he . . . has not presented evidence that he acted with due diligence in seeking to reopen his case” (I.J. at 3).
 
As discussed by the Immigration Judge, none of the respondent’s materials in his motion to reopen “indicate[d] that he took any steps to discover whether he had any alternate options [regarding his immigration status] until after the expiration of the voluntary departure and reopening periods” (I.J. at 3) (emphasis added). See Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) Br. at 4 (noting that the respondent did not file his motion to reopen “until over one month after he failed to depart”). Indeed, the respondent’s own affidavit-- which was attached to his motion to reopen--is dated April 10, 2013 (i.e., the last day in which he could timely file a motion to reopen following the Immigration Judge’s January 10, 2013, order) and fails to even discuss his prior attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s account that his purported confusion regarding the voluntary departure order somehow justifies his “mistaken impression that he could appeal the decision at any time” (Respondent’s Br. at 6). The respondent articulates no plausible basis that would reasonably explain his belief in this regard. See, e.g., Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2002); Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 833, 838-39 (10th Cir. 2005) (discussing the petitioners’ lack of sufficient diligence to justify equitable tolling of the 90-day period for seeking reopening and concluding that “any absence of evidence favorable to equitable tolling was the [petitioners’] fault, as they had the burden of persuasion on the motion to reopen”).
 
Moreover, the fact that the respondent’s complaint against Mr. De Pedro was dismissed on April 23, 2013, by the Colorado Office of Attorney Regulation Counsel belies his claim that he detrimentally relied on “Mr. De Pedro’s bad advice” (Respondent’s Br. at 6, 12). To the extent that he cites Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 18-23 (2008), for the proposition that filing a motion to reopen will nullify the consequence of failing to depart within the voluntary departure period (Respondent’s Br. at 7), the respondent does not recognize that the United States Supreme Court held that filing a motion to reopen during the voluntary departure period and requesting a withdrawal of voluntary departure will nullify the consequence of failing to timely depart. See id.; see also DHS’s Br. at 5-6. As the respondent filed his motion well after the expiration of the period of voluntary departure, his reliance on Dada v. Mukasey, supra, is misplaced. Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion was untimely, and equitable tolling of the time limit was unwarranted as the respondent’s claims of due diligence are not supported by the record (I.J. at 3). See generally Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (allowing equitable tolling of deadlines on motions to reopen “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”).
 
*3 Furthermore, because the respondent has remained beyond the period of voluntary departure, the voluntary departure order has terminated and converted to an order of removal to Mexico (I.J. at 4). Also, given his failure to timely depart and decision to file a motion to reopen outside of the voluntary departure period, he is subject to the consequences of failing to depart under the Act, including being barred from adjustment of status for a period of 10 years (I.J. at 4). See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(a), (e)(2). Despite the respondent’s arguments on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9), he has not cited to any binding case law to show that he is not subject to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act. See DHS’s Br. at 4 (noting that the respondent (1) was granted voluntary departure until April 10, 2013; (2) accepted the Court’s decision in this regard; and (3) did not show that his non-compliance with the Court’s order was the result of his prior attorney’s representation as he opted to remain in the country after receiving the necessary warnings and consequences regarding failing to comply with the voluntary departure order). Moreover, the Board lacks authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or any other equitable exception to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 92 (BIA 2007) (noting that the voluntary departure agreement comes with warnings of the consequences of failing to depart within the time granted while citing the penalties listed under section 240B(d) of the Act).2
 
In addition, upon our de novo review under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii), we conclude that the respondent did not establish any prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s representation. See Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556. Despite the respondent’s contentions on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 13-17), he has not met his burden of proving prejudice or fundamental unfairness. See U.S. v. Sandoval, 390 F.3d 1294, 1299 (10th Cir. 2004). Specifically, he has not shown that but for the ineffective assistance of counsel, there was a reasonable likelihood that he would have been entitled to a different outcome, which in this context would be continued residence in the United States. See U.S. v. Aguirre-Tello, 353 F.3d 1199, 1208 (en banc) (10th Cir. 2004) (A showing of prejudice means that there is a reasonable likelihood that, but for the errors complained of, the applicant would not have been deported) (internal citations omitted). In particular, the respondent cites to no objectively reliable evidence in the record to support his contention that his prior attorney erred by conceding that he “was not inspected and admitted to the United States,” and as such, he has not shown that he is in this country pursuant to a lawful admission and is not subject to removal (Respondent’s Br. at 14-16).
 
*4 Also, despite stating that his former attorney failed to apply for DACA and adjustment of status (Respondent’s Br. at 14), the respondent has not established eligibility for adjustment of status given his inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, and he has not shown a reasonable likelihood of obtaining DACA relief. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988) (an applicant seeking reopening must establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought). Further, as to the latter, neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over the DHS regarding issues of prosecutorial discretion. See, e.g., Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982) (deferred action status is a function of DHS’s prosecutorial grace). To the extent that he states that “former counsel failed to seek administrative closure” under Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012) (Respondent’s Br. at 14), he has not provided any meaningfully discussion of the relevant factors we announced in Matter of Avetisyan, supra, in examining weather administrative closure is warranted. We likewise find no prejudice by his former counsel’s “fail[ure] to preserve an appeal of the voluntary departure decision” given that a grant of voluntary departure prior to completion of proceedings under section 240B(a) of the Act requires an express waiver of the alien’s right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1).
 
In sum, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has not met his burden of establishing that the filing deadline for his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled and we are unable to find that he was prejudiced due to his prior attorney’s representation as he has not shown that there was a reasonable likelihood of qualifying for the relief sought but for such representation. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 420 (1996). While the respondent has offered several documents on appeal, this Board may not accept such materials into the record as it is precluded from fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Further, as the respondent has not established any legal or clear factual error in the Immigration Judge’s decision, we find no basis to reopen or to remand this case for any reason. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Under Matter of Lozada, supra, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by (1) an affidavit setting out the agreement entered into with counsel, (2) proof that notice of the allegations and an opportunity to respond has been provided to counsel whose representation was allegedly ineffective, and (3) the filing of a complaint with appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation for the failure to file a complaint. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (requiring prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions in addition to compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra).

We have held that, absent egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney is binding on his or her client. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Valasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). We do not find that the instant case demonstrates egregious circumstances (Respondent’s Br. at 14-15). See generally Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding that the decision to forego contesting deportability in favor of a generous grant of voluntary departure is a tactical choice, while stating that the attorney “did so based on his belief that pending amnesty legislation would allow petitioners to become lawful permanent residents,” and “[a]lthough looking at this now [in hindsight] we might find this tactical choice to have been unwise, we nevertheless find that it did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel”).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack Andreas Krumbein, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision of November 20, 2013, denying his untimely motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) requests that the Immigration Judge’s decision be upheld. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Motions to reopen are generally disfavored, and the limitations upon them are strictly enforced. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107-08 (1988) (observing that granting such motions too freely will permit endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case); Wang v. Board of Immigration Appeals, 437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir. 2006) (endorsing a strict limitation on motions to reopen and observing that it would be ironic if aliens like the respondent who have remained in the United States illegally following an order of deportation were allowed to have “a second and third bite at the apple” simply because he managed to marry and have children while evading authorities); Cao v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 421 F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992)). Thus, with certain limited exceptions, an alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen a final administrative order of deportation, not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent filed his motion to reopen on November 4, 2013, more than 6 years after the entry of the final administrative order on June 8, 2007. Therefore, the motion was untimely.
 
The respondent was last in removal proceedings in 2007. He was represented by former counsel, Ms. Moidel, and found to be removable as charged and statutorily ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) or section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(c), (h). He reserved appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, but never ultimately perfected an appeal. The respondent was subsequently removed from the United States. On November 4, 2013, he filed to reopen proceedings, alleging that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney. The government opposed reopening. The Immigration Judge rejected the grounds put forth for reopening and denied the motion.
 
*2 For an alien raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the untimeliness of the motion may be excused under the doctrine of equitable tolling. In addition to complying with the procedural requirements for such a claim, the alien must show prejudice as a result of his counsel’s ineffective assistance and that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to toll. See Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007); Celtic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent contends on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have found ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him. The respondent asserts that he never met his prior counsel, that she was ineffective for appearing telephonically and for not filing a brief on his eligibility for relief or for insisting on a merits hearing.
 
Upon review, we affirm the result below, denying reopening. We find first no clear error in any of the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). A motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra. In Lozada, we held that (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) the motion must show that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion must reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
The respondent has not filed a bar complaint against his former attorney. The requirement that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim demonstrate the filing of a bar complaint serves to deter meritless claims and highlights the standards that should be expected of attorneys who represent aliens in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. It also serves to protect against collusion between alien and counsel in which “ineffective assistance” is tolerated, and goes unchallenged by an alien before disciplinary authorities, because it results in a benefit to the alien in that delay can be a desired end, in itself, in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996).
 
*3 Some explanations for not filing a bar complaint may excuse the failure. See e.g. Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding reasonable explanation where employee in attorney’s office who was responsible for recording hearing dates had been suffering from illnesses about which the attorney was unaware, and calendared the hearing date, and the attorney took full responsibility for the error in front of the Immigration Judge the next business day). In this case, the respondent alleges that he lacked the resources to necessary to file a bar complaint. The respondent statement is not, however, adequate to excuse the failure to file a bar complaint, particularly given that the respondent was able to file his motion to reopen despite the same lack of resources in Jamaica. The respondent’s lack of compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, was a proper reason to deny the motion to reopen.
 
More fundamentally, the respondent was not prejudiced by Ms. Moidel’s representation of him because at the time of his June 8, 2007, hearing, he was removable as charged and not eligible for relief. While the case law has changed since his hearing, Ms. Moidel relied on the law at the time and the respondent’s desire to be released from detention. Since the respondent cannot prove prejudice, we dismiss his other due process claims as well. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827, 831 (BIA 1994); Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-7 (BIA 1983). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Enrique Perez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated November 4, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for voluntary departure under sections 240B(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a) and (b). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent does not appeal from the Immigration Judge’s determination that he did not establish his eligibility for voluntary departure (I.J. at 3). See sections 240(c)(4)(A)(i), (ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i), (ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). Therefore, this issue is waived. See, e.g., Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal); Matter of Gutierrez, 19 I&N Dec. 562, 565 n.3 (BIA 1988) (same).
 
Rather, on appeal, the respondent objects to the admissibility of the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, Form I-213. However, the I-213 is a record made by public officials in the ordinary course of their duties and is accorded strong indicia of reliability. See Felzceek v. INS, 75 F.3d 112, 116 (2d Cir. 1996). Moreover, neither before the Immigration Judge nor on appeal has the respondent articulated any basis for his objection to the I-213 other than generally alleging error. On this record, the respondent did not make a prima facie case for suppression. See generally Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a further continuance to retain a new attorney and explore his potential eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. A party seeking a continuance has the burden to establish good cause for the continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. In this regard, the Immigration Judge acknowledged the respondent’s general statement that he feared returning to Guatemala (I.J. at 1). However, the record reflects that the respondent was represented at prior proceedings and did not request any other relief from removal other than voluntary departure (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 11). The record further indicates that the proceedings were continued for the sole purpose of allowing the respondent to establish his eligibility for voluntary departure (Tr. at 11-12). In this regard, we have held that, absent egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney (in this case deciding to pursue only voluntary departure) is binding on his client. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Valasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). The respondent has not alleged any egregious circumstances; nor do we find any such circumstances on this record. Indeed, the respondent has not alleged that his prior attorney was ineffective or complied with the procedural requirements, as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Prior to the reconvened hearing on the respondent’s application for voluntary departure, the respondent fired his attorney and did not secure a new attorney prior to his next scheduled hearing. In addition, the respondent did not file any motion for a continuance prior to the hearing as required by the Immigration Court Practice Manual.
 
*2 Considering it was the respondent’s choice to fire his prior attorney and the absence of any viable legal theory of relief from removal, the respondent did not show good cause for an additional continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 422, 424 (BIA 1987) (Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion for a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent demonstrates that the denial deprived her of a full and fair hearing). Indeed, the viability of the respondent’s proposed asylum application is doubtful considering that the respondent appears time-barred pursuant to section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) from pursuing relief under that section. In addition, the respondent has not proffered any testimony or theory of relief for withholding of removal under the Act, or for protection under the Convention Against Torture that might have been presented had he retained new counsel. Nor has respondent submitted an I-589 or any other application, even now on appeal, to establish prima facie eligibility for any relief from removal. On this record, the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to indicate that if proceedings were continued and had the respondent retained a new attorney that the ultimate result in the disposition of the case would be different. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
In sum, we find nothing in the Immigration Judge’s order or in the manner in which the proceedings were conducted to indicate that the respondent’s due process rights were violated or that he was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827, 831 (BIA 1994); Matter of Tomas, 19 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1987).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John L. Sesini, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Colleen Peppard
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Dominican Republic, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 25, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
At the hearing, the respondent requested a continuance of proceedings to enable him to pursue post-conviction relief with regard to the conviction that serves as the basis for removal, and renders him ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent alleged that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of this conviction, and since a prosecutor would not stipulate to it, he planned to file a motion to vacate it (Tr. at 23).2 After granting prior continuances, the Immigration Judge denied the requested continuance on November 25, 2014 (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 6-9, 18-20, 23-24). On appeal, the respondent challenges denial of the continuance. However, the respondent does not indicate that the conviction has been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles C. Nett, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rook Moore
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the November 5, 2012, decision of the Immigration Judge, which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen these proceedings. The motion had been timely filed following the Immigration Judge’s June 4, 2012, decision which found the respondent removable as charged for being present in the United States without admission or parole based upon her admissions and concession, and granted her pre-conclusion voluntary departure on or before October 2, 2012. Section 240B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion to summarily affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she received ineffective assistance by her former counsel, Mr. Rusty O’Brien and those acting on his behalf. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance by Mr. O’Brien (I.J. at 5). See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 864 (6th Cir. 2006) (alien must establish that, but for the ineffective assistance of counsel, he would have been entitled to continue residing in the United States); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
For example, the respondent did not support her motion to reopen with any applications for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). As to whether prosecutorial discretion by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can be favorably exercised on her behalf, the DHS has its separate authority to grant a respondent deferred action in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, which is not subject to review by an Immigration Judge; and, she can request deferred action status at any stage in these proceedings (I.J. at 4-5). See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec 103, 110 (BIA 2009); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982); see also Matter of Singh, 21 I&N Dec. 427, 433 (BIA 1996). While the respondent relies on a memorandum from John Morton, Director of the United States ICE, entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Consistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens,” dated June 17, 2011, internal memoranda issued by ICE are not binding authority on the Immigration Judge or this Board. Matter of Castillo-Padilla, 25 I&N Dec. 257, 263 (BIA 2010). Additionally, that memorandum does not sufficiently establish that the respondent was prejudiced by any deficiency of counsel in these proceedings.
 
*2 The respondent also argues that she was not required to demonstrate prejudice in order to reopen these proceedings based on Mr. O’Brien’s ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held however that a respondent’s motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel is not required to show prejudice to rescind an in absentia deportation order based on exceptional circumstances. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603 n. 1 (BIA 1996); Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 473 n. 2 (BIA 1996). The respondent’s circumstances are not sufficiently similar to seeking reopening of an in absentia order based on exceptional circumstances; therefore, this claim is not persuasive.
 
Nevertheless, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to assess the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to her request for voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge stated that Ms. Janie Sapon entered a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) and that the respondent did not object to Ms. Sapon representing her (I.J. at 4). We note however that the record does not contain a Form EOIR-28 from Ms. Sapon, to indicate Ms. Sapon was making an appearance on behalf of Mr. O’Brien before the Immigration Judge, and that Ms. Sapon was authorized to speak on the respondent’s behalf on June 4, 2012. The respondent also contends that she received ineffective assistance by those acting on Mr. O’Brien’s behalf.
 
On remand, we request that the DHS inform the Immigration Court of the status of the respondent’s request for prosecutorial discretion. Even though the Immigration Judge’s decision instructs the DHS to consider the respondent’s motion for prosecutorial discretion, the DHS’s appellate brief does not indicate doing so (I.J. at 4-5).
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: CHRISTY DANIUS
File: AXXX XX6 388 - Charlotte, NC

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christina Wanies-Guirgis, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 5, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and reinstated his grant of voluntary departure.1 This motion was not filed until February 5, 2015, and accordingly was filed untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that equitable tolling is warranted in this case. Specifically, he contends that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel insofar as the attorney he retained to file an I-130 visa petition with USCIS did not inform him of the need to file a motion to terminate his grant of voluntary departure.
 
Even assuming equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel applies in removal proceedings, we would conclude equitable tolling was not warranted in this case. See Afanwi v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 788, 796-99 (4th Cir. 2008) (holding that there is no constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings). The representation agreement submitted makes clear that prior counsel was not retained to file any motion to reopen or terminate voluntary departure with the Board (Motion, Tab H). Rather, the respondent - who appears to have assumed the filing of an I-130 petition on his behalf would terminate his voluntary departure grant, despite having received his own copy of the Board’s decision stating the precise conditions under which a grant would be terminated - argues prior counsel had an obligation to proactively tell him that a motion to reopen and terminate would be necessary notwithstanding the limitations of the agreement.
 
Prior counsel has stated that respondent was notified of the need to obtain alternate counsel to address issues arising from his removal proceedings, and that prior counsel received an email from respondent’s sister and carbon copied to the respondent on October 15, 2013, stating that they had retained counsel to file a motion with the Board to preserve immigration benefits (Motion, Tab G). Respondent and his sister do not dispute that the email was sent, but argue that the respondent was not included on the email and was not aware of the need to obtain alternate counsel. Despite the disagreement surrounding this email message, we have not been provided with a copy of the email at issue.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent’s claim to prejudice is not entirely clear. As the respondent is not an arriving alien, exclusive jurisdiction for any application for adjustment of status remains with the Board and Immigration Judge, which would require a motion to reopen prior to adjudication. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1). The respondent’s pending I-130 has not yet been approved, so even if the respondent’s voluntary departure grant had been terminated shortly after the Board’s decision any motion to reopen on the basis of the approved I-130 petition would be untimely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Therefore, even if the respondent had established prior counsel’s coduct was deficient, and even if equitable tolling were available in general, the respondent has not shown the alleged deficiencies prejudiced him in any material respect.
 
Given the evidence in this case, we conclude the respondent has not met his burden of establishing that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (noting the burden for establishing that reopening is warranted rests with the party seeking reopening). The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elliott Ozment, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wylly Jordan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand; voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 6, 2013, finding him removable from the United States, and granting his application for voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1). The appeal will be dismissed in part and sustained in part.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In his appellate brief, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge incorrectly denied his motion to withdraw his concession of removability. In addition, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge set an unreasonably high voluntary departure bond.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not established egregious circumstances to withdraw his former attorney’s concession of removability. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (holding that absent egregious circumstances, a party is bound by his/her attorney’s conduct, including admissions). The respondent argues that his current attorney has discovered that the government has engaged in egregious conduct by requiring his detention in Alabama for an unreasonable period, and thus evidence could be suppressed impacting his removability (Resp. Brief at 9, 15; Motion to Withdraw Plea). However, the respondent’s allegation is insufficient to withdraw his concession of removability.
 
In addition, the respondent argues that his former counsel’s written concession of removability, filed on March 8, 2012, in connection with a motion to change venue, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Brief at 11-18). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). See also Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen, 643 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir. 2011) (requiring that an alien establish prejudice from an attorney’s concession of removability). The respondent has not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not submitted any evidence establishing that he may not be removable from the United States, and thus has not shown that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s concession. In fact, on May 4, 2011 the respondent admitted in court the factual bases for the finding of inadmissibility (Tr. at 8). In light of the foregoing, the respondent has not established an egregious circumstance to withdraw his concession of removability.
 
*2 However, we agree with the respondent’s appellate argument that the Immigration Judge required that he post an unduly high voluntary departure bond (I.J. at 2-3). Section 240B(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(3), states that an alien permitted to depart voluntarily under that subsection shall be required to post a voluntary departure bond “in an amount necessary to ensure that the alien will depart.” The Immigration Judge determined that a $20,000 bond was necessary to ensure compliance with the voluntary departure grant (I.J. at 2-3). Based on the totality of the evidence, we find that a bond of $1,000 is sufficient to ensure the respondent’s departure within the time period specified. Accordingly, we will vacate the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure and alternatively grant the respondent a 60-day period of voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act upon the payment of a bond in the amount of $1,000.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and sustained in part.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent must post a voluntary departure bond in the amount of $1,000 with the DHS within 5 business days of the date of this order. If the bond is not posted within 5 business days, the order of voluntary departure is automatically vacated on the following business day, and the respondent is ordered removed as provided by the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
*3 WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claire H. Kim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge on May 8, 2012. At that time, the respondent agreed to pre-conclusion voluntary departure. On August 29, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, and now appeals the February 9, 2015, decision denying the motion. The respondent seeks reopening so that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) can exercise its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue her removal; or in the alternative, for these proceedings to be administratively closed. The DHS has submitted nothing in favor of the respondent’s motion or appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed for the reasons stated therein. The respondent does not dispute the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion is untimely, and that an exception to 90-day time limit for filing such a motion has not been demonstrated. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Although the respondent alludes to prior ineffective assistance of counsel, she has not attempted to set forth a claim to reopen proceedings on that basis. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of reopening proceedings sua sponte. Although the respondent asserts that she cooperated with authorities to aid a prosecution, and apparently received a temporary stay of removal from the DHS, she did not depart voluntarily as agreed, and--in any event--has no further basis to remain in the United States. The respondent notes that the DHS has not filed an opposition to her motion, but we note that there is nothing to indicate that the DHS has consented to reopening for any purpose, including to exercise its prosecutorial discretion in these concluded proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). As the respondent has no prospective relief potentially available, there was no basis for the Immigration Judge to reopen and administratively close proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert B. Jobe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William P. Hollerich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated March 5, 2013, denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On December 21, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen an order of removal issued by an Immigration Judge on October 6, 1998.1 In the motion the respondent alleges that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel which deprived him of his right to seek review of the Immigration Judge’s order of removal. Specifically, the respondent contends that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by advising him that there was no point in appealing the Immigration Judge’s determination that his conviction for violating California Vehicle Code §§ 23152(b) and 23175 for driving under the influence of alcohol with priors was an aggravated felony crime of violence pursuant to section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F). The respondent contends that he relied on this advice in deciding not to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision, and that in light of subsequent decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit holding that a DUI is not crime of violence, this advice was ineffective and prejudicial. See United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, 259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol with injury to another does not constitute a crime of violence and cannot be an aggravated felony); Montiel-Barraza v. INS, 275 F.3d 1178, 1180 (9th Cir. 2002) (extending the Trinidad-Aquino holding to violations of California Vehicle Code § 23152(a) (DUI without injury to another), including recidivists, reasoning that “[i]f driving under the influence with injury to another does not amount to an aggravated felony, then logically a violation of the lesser offense cannot qualify as an aggravated felony”).
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion is properly denied as untimely (I.J. at 1-4). An alien may file only one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions, it must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i). Motions to reopen are generally disfavored, and the limitations upon them are strictly enforced. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (stating that motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 08 (1988) (observing that granting such motions too freely will permit endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case).
 
The final administrative order in these proceedings was entered by the Immigration Judge on October 6, 1998. The respondent filed the current motion on December 21, 2012, more than 14 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision. Thus, the motion was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative order and it is therefore untimely. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel such that the 90 day filing deadline should be equitably tolled. See Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1095-96 (9th Cir. 2007); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003). As found by the Immigration Judge, at the time the respondent’s former counsel told him that an appeal was unlikely to be successful, recent controlling authority held that the respondent’s offense was an aggravated felony. See Matter of Magallanes, 22 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1998); see also Matter of Puente-Salazar, 22 I&N Dec. 1006 (BIA 1999), overruled by Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336 (BIA 2002).
 
Thus, the respondent’s former counsel’s conclusion that an appeal was unlikely to be successful was not unreasonable under the circumstances. This type of reasonable tactical decision is not amenable to a finding that the attorney was ineffective. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 681 (1984) (noting that counsel’s informed strategic decisions must be respected if they are based on professional judgment); Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986) (concluding that attorney’s tactical decision did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel).2 Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not establish he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that therefore equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline is not warranted.3 Consequently, the respondent’s motion to reopen is properly denied as untimely.
 
*3 Finally, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that sua sponte reopening of the respondent’s removal proceedings is not warranted. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion does not establish an exceptional situation sufficient to warrant sua sponte reopening of his removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). While we acknowledge that certain members of the respondent’s immediate family may experience some hardship upon his removal, we find that the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances sufficient to reopen his proceedings under our sua sponte authority.4 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.5
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

1

We assume the parties’ familiarity with the lengthy procedural history in this case and need not recount it here.

2

We note in this regard that the affidavit the respondent filed in support of his California Bar Complaint against his former counsel indicates that former counsel told him “there was very little that he could to help me with my appeal” and that “based on what [former counsel] told [the respondent] [he] decided to accept the removal order and go back to Mexico” (Motion Exh. Y at 224).

3

We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the circumstances surrounding the reinstatement orders issued by the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel for purposes of tolling the 90 day filing deadline. The respondent does not indicate he relied on the advice of counsel when he unlawfully entered the United States following his 1998 removal. Tamayo-Tamayo v. Holder, 725 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding that substantively illegal reentry met the requirement in section 241(a)(5) of the Act that the alien had “reentered the United States illegally,” notwithstanding the fact that he tricked the border official into allowing him physically to enter). Moreover, the issuance of the reinstatement orders did not affect the fairness of the underlying removal proceedings. Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir. 2008) (concluding there was no ineffective assistance where the failure to file a visa application did not relate to the substance of an ongoing proceeding).

4

In light of our affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not establish that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that his motion is properly denied as untimely, we need not consider the alternative bases the Immigration Judge articulated for denying the respondent’s motion to reopen or the respondent’s related appellate arguments.

5

The record reflects that the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) on September 27, 2012, and initiated new removal proceedings with respect to the respondent by filing the NTA with the San Francisco Immigration Court on October 18, 2012. We take administrative notice that an Immigration Judge recently administratively closed those proceedings, presumably pending the outcome the instant proceedings. In light of our decision here, the parties may move to recalendar removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge pursuant to the NTA dated September 27, 2012.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elif Keles, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 This case is before us on certification by the Immigration Judge following a remand for forwarding of a reconstructed record of proceedings to the Board. The respondent, a native and citizen of Taiwan, filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 14, 2013, which denied his request for a continuance and pretermitted his application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(i).1 The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief or other response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The factual findings of the Immigration Judge are reviewed to determine whether they are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). All other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges, including legal and discretionary determinations and applications of law to fact, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to establish good cause for a continuance (I.J. at 7-8). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355 (BIA 1983); see also Ahmed v. Holder, 569 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir. 2009). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying him a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief of his 1999 controlled substance offense (Resp. Br. at 4-5). The mere pendency of a collateral attack on a conviction does not mean that the conviction is not final for immigration purposes (I.J. at 8). See Matter of Cardenas Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996) (stating that collateral attacks upon a respondent’s conviction do not operate to negate the finality of the conviction unless and until the conviction is overturned); Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546, 551-53 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was warned of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea (I.J. at 8; Exh. 2, at 5). While the respondent asserts on appeal that he was not given any immigration advisals regarding the deferred entry of judgment, he has not shown that he is likely to succeed in having the deferral vacated (I.J. at 8; Respondent’s Appeal Brief; Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). Moreover, to date he has not shown that the deferral has been vacated.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent has failed to show prejudice (Respondent’s Appeal Brief; Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). To date, the respondent has not shown that his deferral has been vacated.
 
The respondent also argues that he was denied counsel (Resp. Br. at 6-7). We are not persuaded by his arguments in this regard. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was given approximately a year with his first attorney to prepare his case and present legal arguments, which was a sufficient amount of time (I.J. at 8).2 Furthermore, when he appeared with his second attorney, whom he hired at the eleventh hour merely to request a continuance, she withdrew as counsel due to lack of cooperation by the respondent (Resp. Br. at 6-7; I.J. at 8; Tr. at 41-42; Motion to Withdraw as Attorney of Record).
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondent has not established such (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal; Respondent’s Appeal Brief). See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusions denying the respondent’s request for a continuance. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent has not contested the Immigration Judge’s determination that he was convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance which renders him permanently ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) (I.J. at 2-7).

2

The respondent states that prior counsel has been disciplined by the Massachusetts bar for poor representation, but he has not established the Mr. Byrd provided inadequate representation in the respondent’s immigration proceedings, and we see no evidence of per se ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Br. at 6).). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (dispensing with the Lozada requirements where ineffective assistance of counsel was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record).

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on November 13, 2014, when we reopened the respondent’s removal proceedings for the limited purpose of reinstating the 60-day period of voluntary departure. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen to allow him to pursue a U visa as well as prosecutorial discretion under the newly announced deferred action plan. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The agency lacks the authority to grant or review both forms of relief sought by the respondent. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has exclusive jurisdiction over U visa petitions. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 811-12 (BIA 2012); see also 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c). An exercise of prosecutorial discretion is granted exclusively by the DHS. Accordingly, reopening of these proceedings is not warranted for the respondent to pursue either form of relief. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009) (holding that the Board generally lacks the authority to reopen a proceeding to allow an alien the opportunity to seek relief from removal where the agency lacks jurisdiction over the form of relief sought).1
 
We are also unpersuaded by the respondent’s claim that reopening is warranted on account of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not complied with the procedural safeguards set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) or otherwise provided sufficient evidence or explanation to establish a valid ineffective assistance claim an explanation of his agreement with prior counsel. See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006) (explaining that, while strict compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is not required in every case, the procedural safeguards set forth therein “provide[] a useful framework for assessing ineffective assistance claims”). Furthermore, the respondent has not established that his proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from establishing his eligibility for a U visa, as he still may pursue that form of relief before USCIS. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.
 
Finally, we decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings as the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance warranting reopening. 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(a); Matter of Yauri, supra; see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

If USCIS approves the respondent’s application, the regulation allows him to file a motion to reopen and terminate proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §214.14(c)(5)(i).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Geoffrey D. Rieman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 4, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s December 10, 2012, motion to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on October 23, 2012, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Act (defining “exceptional circumstances”). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent has not specifically contested any of the Immigration Judge’s legal or factual findings (DHS’s Br. at 1). The respondent’s Notice of Appeal (“NOA”) merely states that he “believes that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen.” See NOA at 2. The DHS also correctly notes that the respondent’s brief “fails to specify [any] alleged error in the Immigration Judge’s decision.” See DHS’s Br. at 1 (stating that the respondent “simply argues that he was prejudiced by [his former counsel’s] ineffective assistance” but that he has failed to comply with the procedural requirements to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding that in order to assert an ineffective assistance claim, an alien must comply with the Boards Lozada requirements).
 
In sum, the respondent provides no substantive discussion of whether the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen. See Respondent’s Br. at 1-3. Without a meaningful challenge to any of the Immigration Judge’s findings, we see no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s order. See Matter of Cervantes-Gonzalez, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (declining to address an issue not raised by a party on appeal); see also Becker v. Kroll, 494 F.3d 904, 913 n.6 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that an issue “““insufficiently raised in the opening brief is deemed waived”).
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s January 4, 2013, decision for the reasons stated therein. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated June 9, 2014, ordering him removed from the United States to Mexico.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand the proceedings to the Immigration Court.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that his prior counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by not seeking asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), or voluntary departure on his behalf. The respondent’s motion is accompanied by an affidavit setting forth his agreement with counsel and asserting that he had asked his former attorney of the possibility of seeking asylum or voluntary departure; an affidavit from the respondent’s girlfriend detailing her interactions with the respondent’s former counsel; copies of payment receipts from the respondent’s former counsel; a completed asylum application; and a copy of a January 16, 2015, letter to the respondent’s former counsel informing him of the allegations of ineffective assistance. The respondent also indicated that he will file a bar complaint no later than February 3, 2015, in order to first give former counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffective assistance, and he will supplement the record with a copy of the bar complaint and with his former counsel’s response, if any. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
The Board has limited ability to engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The determination whether the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, and, if so, whether he was prejudiced, involves findings of fact. Therefore, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and to decide whether further proceedings are warranted to allow the respondent an opportunity to apply for asylum or other forms of relief from removal. By remanding the record, we are not suggesting a desired outcome.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

The issue regarding the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance has been waived on appeal. See, e.g., Capric v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1075, 1089 (7th Cir. 2004) (finding alien did not preserve for appeal due process challenge to admission of evidence where notice of appeal stated hearing did not comport with requirements of due process but appeal brief made no allegations regarding admission of such evidence).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jennifer Oltarsh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia who was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on December 19, 2001, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated July 14, 2014, denying his motion to reopen, which he filed on October 21, 2013. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has not established that these removal proceedings should be reopened on account of lack of notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In support of his appeal, the respondent has presented an additional affidavit disavowing receipt of notice of his removal hearing. However, on July 23, 2001, the Immigration Court mailed the respondent’s former attorney a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings (“NOH”) to place the respondent on notice that a hearing had been scheduled in this matter on December 19, 2001 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 5).1 There is an absence of indicia that the respondent’s former attorney did not receive the NOH (I.J. at 1). See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, as the respondent has not established that he was not placed on notice of his removal hearing vis-à-vis service of the NOH upon his former attorney, reopening is not warranted on account of lack of notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a); Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 n.6 (5th Cir. 2012); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985).
 
The respondent also contends that his former attorney failed to notify him of his removal hearing. However, a claim that ineffective assistance of counsel resulted in his failure to appear at his removal hearing is untimely (I.J. at 2). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). While the respondent does claim that he filed his motion to reopen upon receipt of the results of a request under the Freedom of Information Act, he does not meaningfully argue that, during the approximately 11 years between the entry of the in absentia order of removal and the filing of his motion to reopen, he exercised the requisite due diligence which would warrant equitable tolling of the applicable filing deadline. See Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent requests that these removal proceedings be reopened in light of the approval of an immigrant visa petition filed by his United States citizen spouse and his eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, his request is also untimely (I.J. at 2). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Moreover, there is an absence of an exceptional situation which would warrant sua sponte reopening. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Considering these circumstances, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

On July 20, 2001, the Immigration Court also mailed a NOH directly to the respondent at his claimed address in Brooklyn, New York. However, the NOH was returned to the Immigration Court as undeliverable (Exh. 6).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John D. Friedman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
An Mai Nguyen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; continuance; voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 27, 2013, pretermitting his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), and denying his motion to continue to file a new I-130 visa petition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance and pretermitted his application for adjustment of status because he did not have a visa currently available (I.J. at 2-3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that a continuance was not warranted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (placing the decision to grant or deny a continuance within the discretion of the Immigration Judge if good cause is shown); see also Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not establish good cause for a continuance to apply for this relief (I.J. at 2-3).
 
While this Board has announced numerous factors that should be considered when considering whether removal proceedings should be continued to await a final decision regarding the merits of a pending immigrant visa petition, “the focus of the inquiry is the apparent ultimate likelihood of success on the adjustment application.” Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009). At the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent did not have a pending visa petition, and the Department of Homeland Security opposed the motion (I.J. at 2). The respondent already had two unsuccessful visa petitions from the same spouse petitioner (I.J. at 2). We conclude that, in light of the highly speculative nature of the outcome of a third visa petition from the same spouse, the respondent had not sufficiently demonstrated an apparently ultimate likelihood of success on the adjustment application to warrant a continuance. See Matter of Hashmi, supra, at 790.
 
*2 The respondent’s arguments on appeal are not persuasive, and do not address the complete lack of any basis to grant a continuance to apply for adjustment of status. See Respondent’s Brief. The respondent’s main argument is that the Immigration Judge should not have denied his motion to continue because he received ineffective assistance from the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge. The respondent alleges that his prior counsel failed to adequately prepare for the hearing and show good cause for a continuance. See Respondent’s Brief at *unnumbered* p. 2-3. However, the respondent has yet to demonstrate compliance with the criteria we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of prior counsel. Specifically, the respondent has submitted no proof that former counsel has been made aware of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board and that he has filed a complaint with the state bar. The respondent’s photocopies of letters to former counsel and the state bar are not proof of mailing or filing.
 
Further, even if the respondent had complied procedurally with Lozada, he has not established that former counsel’s action or inaction caused him prejudice in these proceedings. See Matter of Assad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2002) (alien did not establish that this former counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640 (successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing that the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance). Specifically, since the Immigration Judge’s decision nearly two years ago and during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent has not submitted an application for relief, or shown that he has an approved or pending visa petition.1 As the respondent has not presently established prima facie eligibility for any relief, the alleged ineffective assistance has not been shown to have potentially affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. Thus, the respondent has not established a basis to remand his case on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Consequently, the respondent has further failed to show prejudice that resulted from the continuance denial. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Thus, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance and pretermission of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated November 17, 2014, ordering his removal from the United States to Jamaica. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The respondent’s appeal fee waiver request is granted. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. As the Immigration Judge pointed out, the respondent did not apply for relief in these proceedings. The respondent raised no challenge to the finding of removability under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was convicted of one or more criminal offenses in the United States, and he asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal proceedings, but he has not articulated a basis on which this assertion supports overturning the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(b) (stating that, if a question of law is presented, supporting authority must be cited by the appealing party in his notice of appeal). The respondent has not stated that he is, at this time, seeking collateral relief with respect to any conviction. Thus, any conviction which the respondent may have incurred remains a valid and final conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009).
 
While the respondent has not requested a continuance, or stated that he is making a collateral attack on any conviction, we note that, even if he were currently making such a collateral attack, we would still conclude that good cause for a continuance was not shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. While the respondent is free to pursue a collateral attack in the proper court, the mere fact that he is doing so does not justify further delay in these proceedings. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323 (BIA 1996). An alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of an otherwise valid federal or state criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Ponce de Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; A.G. 1997). Though the respondent asserts he has a basis for filing a post-conviction motion or motions, this does not render a conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, supra; Matter of Madrigal, supra. Under the circumstances of this case, there is no evidence that good cause for a continuance has been shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that an alien should not be granted a continuance “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”).
 
*2 As the respondent’s arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to order his removal from the United States to Jamaica, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX3 909 - Baltimore, MD
February 20, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luis C. Diaz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Billy J. Sapp
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 22, 2014, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On January 21, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In the motion, the respondent first argues that the Board “overstepped its appellate boundary in passing on an evidentiary determination never presented to the Baltimore Immigration Court” (Motion, at ¶ 3). The respondent, however, cites no authority for this proposition and does not further develop this argument to show that the Board’s prior decision involved an error of law or fact, as required for a motion to reconsider.1 Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondent also argues that his pro se submission to the Immigration Judge on March 21, 2013, should not have been treated as a motion to reopen, and his former counsel, Ronald Richey, provided him ineffective assistance of counsel by not raising this issue on appeal. In support of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent submitted an affidavit by attorney Richey, stating that he did not previously raise the argument that the respondent’s March 21, 2013, submission was not a motion to reopen (Motion Exh. A).
 
The respondent’s argument that his March 21, 2013, submission should not have been treated as a motion to reopen largely repeats the arguments made in his October 24, 2014, motion to reopen, considered and addressed in the Board’s prior decision. A motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may make the same arguments presented previously and seek reconsideration by generally alleging error in the prior Board decision. Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006).
 
To the extent the respondent now claims ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Richey, his motion in substance constitutes a motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 57-58 (a motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, while a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence). As a motion to reopen, the respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred. Furthermore, the respondent was last represented by attorney Richey on August 11, 2014, when the Board dismissed his appeal, and the respondent did not make the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Richey until the current motion, filed more than 5 months after that time. In any event, in the prior decision the Board also addressed the respondent’s argument that his March 21, 2013, submission should not have been treated as a motion to reopen, and rejected this argument on the merits. The Board also addressed the merits of the respondent’s argument, that he did not receive the letter from attorney Timothy Davis after it was delivered to his house due to the action of his former house mate. Therefore, the respondent’s motion would have been denied on the merits, regardless of the number limitation on the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the respondent failed to show that he was prejudiced by attorney Richey’s failure to raise this argument on appeal. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989).
 
*2 The respondent also argues that the record submitted to the Immigration Judge was not complete due to the ineffective assistance of counsel, and that his case should be remanded to the Immigration Judge. However, the respondent was not represented in his motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge, thus any failure to present more evidence before the Immigration Judge cannot be ascribed to ineffective assistance of a counsel. Based on the above, we find that reconsideration of the Board’s prior decision or reopening of the respondent’s proceedings is not warranted. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied both as a motion to reconsider and as a motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

We note that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(iv) provides that, except for taking administrative notice, “the Board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.” However, the Board’s prior decision involved a motion to reopen filed before the Board, rather than an appeal. Furthermore, in the prior decision the Board assumed as true, for the purpose of analysis, the respondent’s factual assertion that he did not receive the letter from attorney Timothy Davis after it was delivered to his house due to the action of his former house mate.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elizabeth J. Dobosiewicz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Henriques
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s October 3, 2014, written decision which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has requested summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). In determining whether exceptional circumstances exist to excuse an alien’s failure to appear, the “totality of circumstances” pertaining to the alien’s case must be considered. Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear on September 14, 2011, which bears his signature (Exh. 1). On December 8, 2011, the Immigration Judge informed him of the consequences for failure to appear through an interpreter, and he indicated that he understood the consequences (I.J. at 5). On October 26, 2012, the respondent, through counsel, requested voluntary departure and a hearing on voluntary departure was scheduled for May 5, 2014 (I.J. at 2). The respondent was present at the hearing and indicated through an interpreter that he understood that his next hearing was scheduled for May 5, 2014 (Id.).
 
*2 Following a hearing conducted in absentia on May 5, 2014, at which the respondent failed to appear and the DHS presented evidence, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. His counsel appeared and was unable to explain the respondent’s absence (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge granted her request to withdraw as counsel (I.J. at 2-3).
 
On September 12, 2014, the respondent filed a pro se motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. He alleged without elaboration that he did not appear on May 5, 2014, because his attorney allegedly informed him that his hearing was on May 6, 2014. The respondent did not specify when his attorney told him the incorrect hearing date. He claimed that his attorney’s allegedly informing him of the incorrect hearing date, without more, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel amounting to exceptional circumstances, which should excuse his failure to appear. The respondent conceded that he indicated at the October 26, 2012, hearing that he understood that his next hearing date was on May 5, 2014. Furthermore, he alleged without elaboration that he was eligible for asylum although he did not attach an asylum application. Finally, the respondent attached a copy of an Immigration Practitioner Complaint Form (Form EOIR-44) dated September 12, 2014, which he claimed to have filed with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The DHS filed a response in opposition to the motion to reopen.
 
On October 3, 2014, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to rescind the in absentia removal order because the respondent had been personally informed on October 26, 2012, that his next hearing was on May 5, 2014, he indicated that he understood the next hearing date, and he had not established exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear (I.J. at 5). In addition, the Immigration Judge held that the respondent had not established that he merited reopening for the purpose of applying for asylum inasmuch as the record indicated that he had entered the United States prior to 2000, and he had not alleged or established the existence of any changed country conditions to excuse his applying for asylum more than 1 year after his entry date (Exh. 2) (I.J. at 5-6). Finally, he had not attached an asylum application to his motion (I.J. at 6).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel to excuse his failure to appear. He has not established that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of lack of notice because, in addition to the fact that the attorney received notice, he conceded that he understood that his hearing was scheduled for May 5, 2014, when he personally appeared for the hearing on October 26, 2012. See also Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based upon her unsuccessful communications with attorney about hearing date did not establish exceptional circumstances where she failed to satisfy all of requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent has claimed that his attorney purportedly told him an incorrect hearing date, this allegation, without more, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, especially in light of the respondent’s concession that he knew his hearing was scheduled for May 5, 2014. In addition, he has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not provided any proof that he informed his prior attorney about her alleged prior misconduct, and he has not filed a state bar complaint. His claim that he is unable to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, because he is detained, without additional explanation or elaboration, is unavailing.1
 
Finally, the respondent alleges for the first time on appeal that he is eligible for reopening because he purportedly did not receive oral warnings of the consequences for failure to appear at the October 26, 2012, hearing. However, he did not raise this allegation of error in his motion, and the Board does not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. See, e.g., Matter of Jimenez, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996) (issues not raised before Immigration Judge are not properly before Board on appeal); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 638 (BIA 2003). In any event, his reliance on Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), and section 242B of the Act, in support of this argument is misplaced in part because he is removal proceedings and not deportation proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

As part of a Motion To Stay Removal filed on February 6, 2015, the respondent claims he has filed a state bar complaint. However, the Board is an appellate body and we generally do not consider evidence filed on appeal. Also, the respondent has not shown that this complaint could not have been submitted earlier in the proceedings. Thus, we do not consider the additional evidence. In any event, the attorney apparently has not had the opportunity to respond given the late submission. The Motion To Stay Removal is moot given our disposition on the merits.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen Robbins, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated August 29, 2014, denying his motion to reopen. While we accept the respondent’s appeal brief, we will dismiss his appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any alleged deficiencies in his prior attorney’s handling of this case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988) (holding that, in order to warrant reopening on account of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance); see also Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
Here, the respondent contends that his former counsel did not advise him of the ability to pursue an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589). However, as recognized by the Immigration Judge, the Form I-589 which the respondent offered in support of his motion to reopen provided no substantive information about his claim (I.J. at 2). While the respondent did check the box on page 5 of his proposed Form I-589, to indicate that he is seeking asylum and withholding of removal on account of his membership in a particular social group, he has not provided the exact delineation of any particular social group to which he claims to belong. See Matter of A-T-, 25 I&N Dec. 4 (BIA 2009). On appeal, the respondent has referred to being handicapped as a result of a workplace injury (Respondent’s Br. at 3). However, he not meaningfully argued that such status amount to membership in a particular social group cognizable under the Act. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014). He has also not offered any evidence that handicapped individuals are persecuted in Mexico. While the respondent does refer to a cousin that was killed in Mexico, he does not claim that his cousin was also handicapped or otherwise similarly situated. A generalized fear of crime and violence in Mexico does not amount to a basis to grant the respondent asylum or withholding of removal as he must demonstrate that a protected ground is a “central reason” for the claimed harm. See Matter of C-T-L-, 25 I&N Dec. 341, 347 (BIA 2010); Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2007).
 
*2 The respondent has also not meaningfully articulated a basis upon which he would warrant protection under the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a); Matter of J-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. 912 (A.G. 2006).
 
For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice needed to reopen these proceedings on account of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Helen Harnett, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William C. Padish
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 26, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to reopen. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion does not convince us that reconsideration of our previous decision is warranted. A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent largely raises the same or similar arguments in the motion to reconsider as were raised in his appeal brief, motion to reopen, and response to the DHS’s opposition. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we dismissed his appeal and denied his motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal . . .”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient.
 
To the extent that the respondent is attempting to raise new arguments related to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, these arguments are not properly raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider. See O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied” and “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) (citation omitted). A motion to reconsider is neither a vehicle for advancing supplemental legal arguments that could have been previously raised nor a mechanism for submitting a late-filed brief. Moreover, we are not persuaded by the case law the respondent’s cites from outside the controlling jurisdiction and do not find that the respondent’s supplemental arguments affect the ultimate determination that he is removable as charged. Therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening; stay
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration December 20, 2012, decision denying her timely motion to reopen.1 The respondent’s motion was filed on December 6, 2012, after the Immigration Judge granted her pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), in a decision dated September 7, 2012. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) (generally setting a 90-day deadline for filing motions to reopen). The respondent then filed this timely appeal. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). Her appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following facts and procedural history are not in dispute. The respondent entered the United States on March 26, 1985, as a non-immigrant visitor but remained longer than authorized (Exhs. 1A, 4:1). On June 14, 2001, she pled guilty to and was convicted of injury to a child, a third degree felony (Exh. 3). She is the beneficiary of an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed on her behalf by her United States citizen son and approved by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on June 1, 2011 (Exh. 4:3). In light of the respondent’s conviction and her approved visa petition as an immediate relative, she sought adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), before the Immigration Judge (Exh. 4).2
 
*2 At her final hearing, scheduled before the Immigration Judge on September 7, 2012, the respondent was advised that her adjustment application would be denied (I.J. at 1).3 Thereafter, she consulted with her then-counsel off the record before withdrawing her applications for adjustment and a 212(h) waiver and accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Act (I.J. at 1).
 
On December 6, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen through new counsel in which she maintains that her previous attorney provided ineffective assistance (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3-7; Tabs E, I-J). Specifically, she maintains that her prior attorney performed deficiently because he did not advise her that she needed to obtain an updated medical examination prior to her final hearing (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 6; Tab E). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(o), (q), (r) (requiring a practitioner to provide competent representation, to act with reasonable promptness and diligence in representing the respondent before the Immigration Court, and to maintain appropriate communication with the respondent during the course of such representation). In addition, the respondent maintains that when issues regarding the medical examination were raised at her final hearing, her former attorney did not advise her about the problem but instead told her that the Immigration Judge was denying her applications because of her criminal conviction (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6; Tab E). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(r)(1)-(2) (requiring counsel to promptly inform the respondent about any decision or circumstance requiring the respondent’s informed consent, consult with the respondent regarding such consent, and consult with the respondent about the means by which the respondent’s objectives may be accomplished). The respondent also maintains that her attorney performed deficiently because he did not request a continuance in allowing her to remedy the alleged defect in her application (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 6; Tab E). Instead, she asserts that her attorney misled her when advising her about her options by telling her the Immigration Judge could immediately arrest her if she did not agree to withdraw her applications for relief and accept voluntary departure and indicating to her that she did not have other options (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 7; Tab E). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(p) (requiring the practitioner to abide by the respondent’s decisions concerning the respondent’s objectives after reasonably consulting with the respondent in advising her of such options); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(r)(2).
 
*3 On December 20, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding the record does not contain sufficient evidence establishing that the respondent’s former attorney performed deficiently when counseling the respondent with respect to her options in these proceedings (I.J. at 1). Specifically, he concluded that the respondent’s decision to accept voluntary departure was knowing and voluntary because (1) her counsel confirmed on the record that he spoke with the respondent regarding her options, (2) the Immigration Judge confirmed this in questioning the respondent on the record, and (3) the respondent signed the Immigration Judge’s order granting pre-conclusion voluntary departure and advising the respondent of her rights and responsibilities thereunder (I.J. at 1). In addition, the Immigration Judge concluded that, notwithstanding any deficiencies in prior counsel’s performance, the respondent did not establish that she would have prevailed on her adjustment and waiver applications if she had a hearing on the merits (I.J. at 1-2).
 
At the outset, we note that the Immigration Judge did not conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen does not comply with the procedural requirements for motions based on ineffective assistance as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Resp. Motion to Reopen at Tabs E, I-J). See id. at 639 (explaining that generally a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance should generally be supported by (1) an affidavit from the aggrieved party, (2) evidence that the former attorney has been advised of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, along with any response offered, and (3) evidence that appropriate disciplinary authorities have been notified or, if not, the reason such notification is not being pursued); see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014) (confirming the applicability of these procedural requirements within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, wherein this case arises).
 
Although the Immigration Judge concluded that the record contains insufficient evidence of misconduct by the respondent’s former attorney, in part, because the Immigration Judge spoke to the respondent on the record and confirmed her willingness to withdraw her applications for relief and accept voluntary departure, we note that the Immigration Judge’s decision does not consider all of the allegations of misconduct made by the respondent (I.J. at 1; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6, Tabs E, I-J; Resp. Brief at 3-10). Specifically, the respondent maintains that her attorney told her that (1) she did not have any other options, including an opportunity to appeal; and (2) the Immigration Judge could immediately arrest her if she declined to accept voluntary departure, such that she did not knowingly and voluntarily accept this grant of relief (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6, Tabs E, I-J; Resp. Brief at 3-4). While we agree with the Immigration Judge that we will generally bind a respondent to the tactical decisions she makes with her counsel, she is not bound by these decisions to the extent she makes a showing of egregious circumstances (I.J. at 1). See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 166-67 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
*4 Here, we conclude that such egregious circumstances have been demonstrated where the respondent claims in her unrebutted affidavit that her attorney (1) did not tell her an updated medical was required, (2) did not advise her at her hearing that her adjustment application was incomplete, and thus subject to denial, based on the date of the medical examination, (3) did not request a continuance to obtain an updated medical examination, (4) did not advise the respondent that she could appeal any adverse decision issued by the Immigration Judge, and (5) advised the respondent that her only option was to accept voluntary departure because her failure to do so would result in her arrest by the Immigration Judge (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6, Tabs E, I-J; Resp. Brief at 3-10).
 
Moreover, we agree with the respondent that her proceedings were rendered fundamentally unfair by her attorney’s conduct, as his failure to advise her of the need for an updated medical examination and failure to request a continuance to remedy the defect led directly to a determination that she could not prevail on the adjustment application at her final hearing before the Immigration Judge (Resp. Brief at 9-10; I.J. at 1). See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (requiring ineffective assistant to be so egregious as to render the hearing unfair); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993) (requiring an alien to demonstrate “substantial prejudice” in order to establish that a hearing is fundamentally unfair). While we express no opinion as to the respondent’s ultimate statutory and discretionary eligibility for adjustment of status with a waiver of inadmissibility, we conclude that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to establish that the respondent knowingly and voluntarily withdrew her applications for relief and we have identified no apparent, statutory impediments to her ability to proceed with these previously filed applications. See Anwar v. INS, 116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir. 1997); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (requiring an alien to establish prima facie eligibility for relief from removal to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Accordingly, in light of the respondent’s timely motion, supported by her unrebutted affidavit asserting that her prior attorney performed deficiently and deceptively in securing her consent to withdraw her applications for relief and to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure, we conclude that reopening of this matter is appropriate. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to pursue her previously withdrawn applications.
 
*5 In light of our disposition of this matter, we decline to address the respondent’s motion for a stay as moot. Upon remand, the parties will have an opportunity to supplement the record with any documentation or testimony they may choose to present regarding the respondent’s statutory and discretionary eligibility for adjustment of status sought in conjunction with her waiver of inadmissibility.
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and her motion to reopen, granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay is denied as moot.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including, but not limited to, proceedings allowing the respondent to pursue her applications for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act.

Because the Immigration Judge served his decision on the parties by mail on December 28, 2012, the respondent’s January 25, 2013, Notice of Appeal is timely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(c) (setting a 30-day deadline for filing a Notice of Appeal beginning from the date that the Immigration Judge’s decision is served by mail).

2

Some of the facts recited in this order were not formally found by the Immigration Judge but may be administratively noticed based on the record evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting our appellate fact-finding authority to “taking administrative notice of commonly known facts such as the contents of official documents”); Matter of S-H-, supra, at 465-66.

3

Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved to pretermit the respondent’s adjustment application due to a purportedly out-of-date medical examination, at which point the respondent’s former counsel agreed to discuss pre-conclusion voluntary departure with the respondent (I.J. at 1). We need not ultimately address whether the medical exam was expired, thus forming a valid basis for pretermitting the respondent’s adjustment application. However, we note that 8 C.F.R. §§ 245.5 and 1245.5 indicate that the exam must be completed no more than a year prior to the filing of the adjustment application, and the relevant statute and regulations do not further define whether the medical expires during the pendency of an adjustment application if the application remains under review for a period of more than a year from the date that the examination was completed. However, at the time that the Immigration Judge found the respondent statutorily ineligible to adjust her status due to the expiration of her medical examination USCIS maintained a policy in which the agency considered a medical examination to remain unexpired during the pendency of such application in the absence of any noted Class A or B medical condition. See, e.g., Policy Memorandum, Extension of Validity of Medical Certifications on Form I-693 (December 29, 2011) (valid until January 1, 2013).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William A. Quiceno, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board to reconsider its September 12, 2014, decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). We find no error of fact or law in our prior order. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The motion will be denied.
 
On March 23, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal. More than 3 years later, on May 19, 2014, the respondent moved the Board to reopen and rescind the in absentia order based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The Board declined to toll the filing deadline because the respondent did not show that she acted diligently in pursuing her ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The respondent, who claims to have retained the above-named attorney in 2012, and filed the prior motion on May 19, 2014, has not satisfactorily explained the delay in bringing the motion to reopen and rescind before the Board. Therefore, we remain unpersuaded that the respondent acted diligently in pursuing a remedy for the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Pafe v. Holder, 615 F.3d 967, 969 (8th Cir. 2010); Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 866 (8th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Patrick E. McClintock
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The motion to reopen is untimely. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 26, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent filed his motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal on November 14, 2014, over 11 years after the Board’s final order. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent is continuing to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the Lozada1 procedural requirements. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94-95 (BIA 2007) (finding that the alien satisfied the concerns underlying the Lozada requirements by complying with the first two steps). Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s actions or inactions. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on failure to pursue a discretionary waiver of relief from removal); Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 476 (5th Cir. 2004) (“because Assaad’s attorney’s allegedly deficient performance merely restricted his chances of receiving a discretionary waiver of his removability, we conclude that he has not alleged a violation of his due process rights”); see also Altamiro-Lopez v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir. 2006) (the denial for discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest). Here, the respondent has not sufficiently established prima facie eligibility for relief. Thus, the respondent has not shown due diligence or prejudice to warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel
 
To the extent that the respondent is also seeking to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed circumstances or conditions arising in Pakistan, he has not submitted any evidence in support of his claim nor has he articulated a basis for relief. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, the respondent has not submitted a new asylum application along with his motion as required by regulation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). As such, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s alleged fear of harm in Pakistan is adequately supported. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988) (a motion to reopen may be denied if alien does not establish prima facie case for the relief sought); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (to prevail on a motion to reopen an alien must establish that “the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case”).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen his proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). While the respondent alleges that he will seek adjustment of status based on a yet to be filed immediate relative visa petition, he is an arriving alien and thus, USCIS has sole jurisdiction over any future application for adjustment of status. Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107 (BIA 2009). Accordingly, the motion and stay will be denied.2
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), requires a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim be accompanied by: “(1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the alien notified former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel’s conduct and, if a complaint was not filed, an explanation for not doing so.”).

Any request for prosecutorial discretion must be addressed to the DHS. The Board does not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jamahl C. Kersey, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 17, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. The respondent did not request relief from removal. On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Before the Immigration Judge, the respondent requested and was granted continuances of proceedings from April 17, 2014, to October 17, 2014, to enable him to pursue post-conviction relief with regard to the conviction that serves as the basis for removal, and renders him ineligible for relief from removal (Tr. at 17, 22, 25, 40, 47-48, 54). The respondent alleged that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of this plea.1 He filed a motion to vacate his conviction before the state court, but that motion was denied. At the final hearing, the respondent indicated a desire to purse a habeas corpus action, but the Immigration Judge denied the requested continuance (Tr. at 54-56).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges denial of the continuance. The respondent says that a habeas corpus action has been filed but does not indicate that the conviction has been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v.

January 29, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lorena Marquez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on October 31, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, affirming the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent had not demonstrated good cause for a continuance to pursue prosecutorial discretion from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and that the respondent did not warrant preconclusion voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. The DHS has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent requests reconsideration of our prior decision because he argues that the decision is based on the mistaken conclusion that he was convicted of two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol, one in 2010 and another in 2011, when, in fact, he was only charged with driving under the influence in 2010, but never convicted (Resp. Mot. at 2-3; Exhs. A-B). The respondent argues that his prior counsel was ineffective in that he did not inform the court that the respondent was only convicted one time (Resp. Mot. at 2). In support of this argument, the respondent has submitted evidence for the first time which demonstrates that his 2010 charge for driving under the influence was dismissed (Resp. Exh. A at 5). Accordingly, the motion is also in the nature of a motion to reopen.
 
We see no reason to reconsider our prior decision or reopen proceedings in light of the new evidence presented. First, the respondent has not established that the evidence, which was available at the time of the previous hearing, was not submitted as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. He has neither substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor is ineffective assistance plain from the administrative record. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (explaining that “[t]o establish ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion to reopen, an alien must” meet Lozada’s criteria); see Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (explaining that strict compliance with Matter of Lozada may not be required where ineffective assistance of counsel is plain from the administrative record).
 
Even if the respondent was to establish that his counsel was neglectful in failing to file evidence of his prior convictions, we do not conclude that “the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999). While it does appear that the respondent was in fact not convicted of driving under the influence in 2010, the evidence indicates that he was arrested for such an offense, made to complete alcohol awareness classes, and that his alcohol use was limited as a condition of his probation (Exh. A). That arrest, and subsequent probation, are still relevant to the discretionary determination on his application for relief, even if it did not result in a conviction. See e.g. Matter of Grijalva, 19 I&N Dec. 713, 722 (BIA 1988) (advising that in cases involving discretionary relief, all relevant factors concerning criminal history, including arrests not resulting in a conviction, and information contained in police reports should be considered). The particularly troubling aspect of this respondent’s misconduct was his 2011 driving under the influence conviction shortly after he had attended alcohol awareness classes in 2010. As emphasized by the Immigration Judge, the respondent apparently “learned nothing from those classes that he took in 2010” because he was “well aware of the consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol, but chose to get in a car again and put the lives of other people at risk by driving under the influence of alcohol.”
 
*2 As such, we conclude that the respondent was not prejudiced by counsel’s actions and that reopening for further consideration of the respondent’s application for pre-conclusion voluntary departure is not warranted. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (explaining that the party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from removal bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case).
 
Finally, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that his proceedings should be reopened to allow him to pursue his Form I-589, submitted for the first time with this motion, because of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Br. at 2). As explained above, the respondent has not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada in making his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and nothing in the record suggests that respondent’s counsel was ineffective in not pursuing this form of relief on the respondent’s behalf previously. See Ortiz v. INS, supra, at 1153; Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra, at 596-99. The respondent’s right to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture was fully explained to him at his hearing and he was given two continuances for the purpose of completing those applications (Resp. Mot. at 3; Exh. C; Tr. at 9-10, 14, 17). Accordingly, we see no reason to remand proceedings to allow the respondent to pursue that form of relief. Therefore, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on August 22, 2014, at which time the respondent’s appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of May 17, 2013, was dismissed. That decision pretermitted the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). On November 14, 2014, the respondent filed the timely motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The Board may in some cases grant a motion to reopen in order to remedy an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). Nonetheless, in this matter, the respondent has failed to show that but for the assistance rendered, he would have been entitled to relief from removal. In particular, the respondent contends that former counsel erred in conceding that he, the respondent, was removable as charged. However, the respondent has failed to provide to former counsel, and has continued to fail to provide to the Board, appropriate evidence to establish lawful entry. Absent such evidence, the respondent has failed to show the prejudice requisite to establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 (5th Cir. 2001). To the extent that the respondent seeks humanitarian relief to enable him to remain in the United States, such relief is to be pursued with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Likewise, any request for relief from removal in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion must also be made to the DHS. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is, hereby, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul W. Shonk, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Goulding
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of India who entered the United States as a conditional permanent resident based on a marriage to a United States citizen. His status was terminated by USCIS, the Immigration Judge denied his good faith waiver, sustained the charge of marriage fraud, and the Board dismissed his appeal. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also seeks a remand based on his marriage to another United States citizen and a pending I-130 visa petition. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the granting of the motion. The motion is denied.
 
A motion to reopen “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing . . . .” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The movant must also establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988), and satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent does not address the requirement that the evidence must not be previously available. Rather, the respondent contends that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not also pursue an extreme hardship waiver based on his alleged persecution in India, which continued against his family even after he moved to the United States, or adequately prepare him, or his witnesses, for trial (Motion, Exh. A). Many years after the fact, the respondent also argues that his mother should not have been called as a witness because she had dementia. We find no basis to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the record indicates that Mr. Thomas’s representation was thorough and that he was an effective advocate on behalf of the respondent during this proceeding. Mr. Thomas filed a response to the complaint which confirms this view (Notice of Filing Counsel’s Response to Bar Complaint, filed 1/7/15). A review of the record indicates that the respondent had at least three different attorneys in this proceeding before Mr. Thomas entered his appearance (EOIR-28 filed 3/6/08 for Karen Denise Bradley; I.J. Order issued 3/27/08 substituting Candie Clement; I.J. Order issued 4/1/08 substituting David Wenger; I.J. Order issued 2/8/12 substituting Mark Jacob Thomas).
 
*2 An attorney prior to Mr. Thomas prepared and pursued the I-751 waiver with USCIS. It is well-settled that where USCIS has denied a waiver, the respondent may not pursue an alternative waiver under section 216(c)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4) during proceedings. See Matter of Anderson, 20 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 1994). Further, the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence of changed circumstances occurring after the filing of the original waiver so that Mr. Thomas would have had notice and been able to seek a continuance. Id.
 
As to the question of extreme hardship, even if Mr. Thomas had pursued an untimely waiver and argued that the alleged extreme hardship arose during the requisite two year period, we do not find that the respondent’s current claims are credible (Motion, Exhs. F and G). The respondent and his father allege that due to the persecution, the respondent was in hiding at a relative’s home prior to leaving India, and his father asserts that he was forced to immigrate soon after due to the continued persecution (Motion, Exh. F at p. 045; Exh. G at p. 048). However, the documents and affidavits filed with USCIS in 2001 within several years after the last incidents of alleged harm make no mention of persecution, harm, hiding, or fear of residing in India.
 
Rather, in his 2001 filings with USCIS (long before Mr. Thomas represented him), the respondent submitted an affidavit under oath that described his courtship in India. He attested to their initial meeting in his family home in India, their visits with her children, their visits and “shopping all over the city” together, looking around for a wedding hall, their ceremony and honeymoon, visits with relatives, his playing with her children, residing at his parents’ house with his new wife, driving to the airport and waiting there until her plane took off, and obtaining his visa and coming to the United States (I.J. Dec. at 3; Exh. 2, Tab B at pp. 61-63). The respondent’s father also submitted a prior affidavit and did not mention the alleged fears or the fact that his son was in hiding (Exh. 2, Tab B at pp. 64-66), which they now claim over 13 years later.
 
Given the inconsistencies between the affidavits filed with the motion long after the alleged events occurred and the affidavits already contained in the record, we find that the respondent’s current claims are not credible. Further, given the representations made by the respondent and his father under penalty of perjury in the 2001 filing with USCIS, there was no reason for Mr. Thomas to inquire further or explore an untimely extreme hardship waiver. Accordingly, we do not find that Mr. Thomas provided ineffective assistance of counsel to the respondent such that proceedings should be reopened and remanded. Nor has the respondent shown the requisite prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*3 The respondent has a pending I-130 based on his marriage to another United States citizen, but he is not prima face eligible to adjust his status (I.J. Dec. at pp. 27-28 sustaining marriage fraud charge of removability). Section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c). Further, the respondent filed a document indicating that his conditional permanent resident status has somehow been reinstated. See Notice of Filing dated 11/10/14, Tab A). Therefore, the respondent is not eligible to adjust his status under section 245. Section 245(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(d). The following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hardeep Rai, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on July 28, 2014. On November 25, 2014, the respondent filed the motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsels. The respondent has complied, in part, with the process requisite to asserting such a claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has provided detailed affidavits setting forth the bases for his assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel; evidence of fee arrangements and payments both in the United States and abroad to former counsels; evidence of representation by former counsels; bar complaints filed against one of the attorneys in two different jurisdictions, California and Texas; adverse information from the press relating to an individual associated with former counsel who also played a part in the representation of the respondent; and, a press report naming the individual who the respondent met at the detention center who referred him to former counsel. The respondent paid substantial fees to an attorney, referred to him by an individual at the Eloy detention facility, who, with the assistance of other attorneys, appeared in proceedings on behalf of the respondent, but ultimately failed to file an application for relief by the deadline set resulting in the respondent’s inability to seek the relief of asylum in the United States.
 
The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. We accept the respondent’s detailed affidavit, which we accept as true for purposes of this motion (see Najmabadi v. Holder, 597 F.3d 983, 994 (9th Cir. 2010)). Given the circumstances detailed in the respondent’s affidavit, we find that an adequate showing of due diligence has been made, that equitable tolling is appropriate and that reopening should be granted. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011). On remand, the respondent shall have the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amos W. Carty, Jr., Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Anguilla, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated June 10, 2013, ordering his removal from the United States.2 We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent is inadmissible to the United States under the provisions of section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(7)(A)(i)(I), because he is an immigrant who, at the time of his application for admission, did not possess a valid entry document (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent arrived in the United States on July 20, 2012, after having been absent for more than 1 year (Exh. 1; Tr. at 15). While, according to the Record of Deportable / Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213), the respondent did present a Lawful Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551) upon his application for admission to this country, a Form I-551 is sufficient to allow for an alien’s admission to the United States only if the alien “if seeking readmission after a temporary absence of less than 1 year.”3 8 C.F.R. § 211.1(a)(2).
 
The Immigration Judge advised the respondent that he could seek a waiver of the requirement that he hold a valid entry document by filing an Application for Waiver of Passport and/or Visa (Form I-193) (Tr. at 11). See section 211(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(b). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent to file everything, i.e., the Form I-193, a witness list, and supporting documents, with the Immigration Court no later than June 3, 2013, and, if the documents were not timely filed, she would consider the form to be abandoned (Tr. at 20). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.31(a), (c); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992). The respondent contends that he attempted to fax his Form I-I93 to the Immigration Court on June 3, 2013. Attempting to file a Form I-193 by fax was improper because, aside from the Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28), “[a]ll other filings must be submitted as paper submissions to the Immigration Court.”4 Immigration Court Practice Manual, § 3.1(a)(viii) at 34 (June 10, 2013), http:// www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/OCIJPracManual/Practice_Manual_review.pdf. Accordingly, as the respondent has not established that he timely complied and properly complied with the Immigration Judge’s filing deadline, the Immigration Judge properly deemed his opportunity to file a Form I-193 to be abandoned and ordered his removal from the United States to Anguilla.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has presented numerous documents on appeal. However, the Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (“The Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record.”). Additionally, we decline to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the evidence in the first instance as such evidence has not been shown to affect the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Even though the respondent has attached several letters of support to his appeal brief, as discussed above, he is inadmissible under the provisions of section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act and has abandoned his opportunity to file a Form I-193.
 
For the reasons set forth above, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed at a Department of Homeland Security office in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands (see OPPM No. 04-06). The Immigration Judge conducted the hearings there remotely from the Immigration Court in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, via video teleconference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.

2

The respondent, through counsel, claims that, on June 5, 2013, he mailed a Form I-193 to the Immigration Court and, on June 14, 2013, he filed a motion to reconsider. However, neither of those filing are currently present in the record of proceedings.

3

There are exceptions to the rule that a Form I-551, in itself, is sufficient to allow for an alien’s the admission to the United States only if the alien is seeking readmission after a temporary absence of less than 1 year. For example, in certain circumstances, an alien seeking readmission after a temporary absence of more than 1 year may present a Form I-551 if he is seeking readmission after any temporary absence connected with his or her duties as a crewman or he is an employee of the United States government. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 211.1(a)(2), (5), (6), (7). However, the respondent does not meaningfully argue that he is entitled to an exception to this rule.

4

The respondent does not argue that his attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by attempting to file his Form I-193 by fax. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Helen Ramirez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and will be denied. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent filed the motion more than a decade after the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in June 2004. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
The respondent does not dispute that his motion is untimely, but urges that the time limit for motions to reopen should be equitably tolled because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by two prior attorneys. The respondent has substantially complied with the threshold procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for pursuing an ineffective assistance claim. To warrant equitable tolling, however, the respondent must also demonstrate due diligence in raising the claim. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, All F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent avers that attorneys Pasquale F. Giannetta and Marcia S. Kasdan deficiently represented the respondent. The respondent alleges that attorney-Giannetta, inter alia, did not explain or obtain the respondent’s consent to waive appeal in order to obtain the benefit of voluntary departure, failed to explain or pursue available forms of relief on the respondent’s behalf, and did not file an appellate brief on the respondent’s behalf. The respondent alleges that in 2007 he retained attorney-Kasdan who also failed to regularly communicate with the respondent and did not pursue adjustment of status on the respondent’s behalf in connection with a labor certification approval and Form I-140 approval in April 2009.
 
The respondent should have been aware of attorney-Giannetta’s alleged deficient performance when we issued our decision in 2004. And he should have known of attorney-Kasdan’s inadequate representation - at the very latest - when she repeatedly refused to meet with him regarding his employment-related visa petition (Form I-140), which the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services approved in April 2009. The respondent has not adequately explained why he waited more than a decade to raise ineffective assistance against attorney-Giannetta, and more than 5 years for his claim against attorney-Kasdan. Under the circumstances, the respondent has not established the requisite due diligence to raise ineffective assistance in order to equitably toll the 90-day time limitation on motions to reopen.
 
While the respondent has submitted evidence that the New Jersey licensing authority has sanctioned attorney-Giannetta and attorney-Kasdan, he does not allege that counsels’ sanctions arose from deficient performance in these proceedings.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has not set forth “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “““[a]s a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). The respondent requests reopening so that he may seek adjustment of status based upon a recently-approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. But becoming eligible for relief from removal, such as adjustment of status, after a final administrative order has been entered is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting consideration of an untimely motion to reopen. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yousof W. Nesari, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the October 6, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reconsider the denial of an August 4, 2014, motion to reopen proceedings in which he had been ordered removed on May 8, 2012, In his 2012 decision, the Immigration Judge also granted his request for voluntary departure. The respondent has submitted both a “motion to reopen” and a “motion to remand” on appeal. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed, and the motions denied.
 
We initially affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1002.23(b)(2); see also Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006) (requiring that a respondent demonstrate at least “““substantial compliance” with the Lozada requirements); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although the respondent’s motion to reopen was predicated on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not substantially comply with the requirements for reopening on such a basis. Id. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not file a state bar complaint against former counsel, and did not inform counsel of the allegations of ineffectiveness and notify him that he may respond. Rather, the letter he sent to former counsel specifically stated that it was not intended for Lozada compliance (Motion, tab J, ftnt. 1).
 
We recognize that the respondent submitted a number of documents with his motion to reconsider. However, a motion to reconsider is a respondent’s opportunity to specify errors of law or fact in the previous order. It is not intended to serve as a mechanism to present new evidence, or to provide an opportunity to reiterate or expand upon arguments that have been previously raised and considered. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). As such, we find that the Immigration Judge committed no error in not addressing the evidence newly submitted with the motion to reconsider.1
 
*2 While the appeal at issue was pending, the respondent filed a “motion to reopen” on December 12, 2014, averring that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance.2 As the respondent is seeking reopening of the Immigration Judge’s 2012 decision, the motion is untimely filed. 8 C.F.R. § 1002.23(b)(1). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can serve to exempt a motion from the noted deadline, as indicated supra. However, we continue to find that the respondent has not complied with the requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. To date, the respondent admittedly has not filed a state bar complaint against former counsel, despite the fact that he was informed of this deficiency in the Immigration Judge’s October 6, 2014, decision (Motion at 4). While he states that he is awaiting further instructions from the court, this vague assertion is insufficient to excuse him from compliance with this requirement.
 
This is also true of the requirement that he notify former counsel of the allegations of ineffectiveness, and inform him that he may respond. In this regard, we note that the July 22, 2014, letter sent by the respondent’s current attorney to his former counsel does not contend that the respondent informed him of any fears, experiences, or concerns forming the basis for a claim of asylum or associated relief. Rather, the letter asks why such relief was not sought, and makes factual statements in this regard. It does not allege that these concerns were ever conveyed to former counsel, and not acted upon. In addition, a letter from former counsel states that the respondent did not express any fear of return to Mexico although he was asked about the same. Counsel also reports that he was not informed that the respondent’s mother was “““completely dependent” on him, as claimed in the July 22, 2014, letter. Given these significant deficiencies, we find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
As indicated above, the respondent has also filed a “motion to remand to Immigration Judge.” He seeks a remand as he contends that he is eligible under an expansion of the provisional unlawful presence waiver (I-601A) as directed by President Obama. In this regard he cites a directive from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Johnson regarding the noted expansion. We presume the respondent is referencing a November 20, 2014, memorandum from Secretary Johnson. Therein Secretary Johnson directed DHS to amend its regulation regarding the provisional waiver program. However, to date no such amendment has been promulgated. We are not unsympathetic to the situation faced by the respondent and his family. However, any request for a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion should be directed to the DHS as the Board is without authority to grant any such request.
 
*3 In sum, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that reconsideration of his denial of the respondent’s prior motion to reopen was not appropriate. In addition, we further find that reopening based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as asserted in the respondent’s second motion to reopen is not appropriate. Finally, we find that a remand based on Secretary Johnson’s directive is also not warranted. Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motions are denied.

1

The respondent’s arguments that the grant of voluntary departure was void ab initio because of Immigration Judge error are in the nature of a motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s 2012 decision, and are untimely in that regard (Resp. Br. at 4). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). To the extent that there respondent may suggest that this forms another basis for a claim of ineffective assistance, he has not complied with the relevant requirements for such a claim in this regard. As such, we shall address these contentions no further.

2

While the respondent again avers that his voluntary departure grant may be void ab initio, also alleging that the Immigration Judge neglected to appropriately question him regarding voluntary departure, such arguments are in the nature of a motion to reconsider and have been untimely filed, as previously noted (Motion at 5-7).

Brian J. Counihan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(C), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C)] - Convicted of firearms or destructive device violation
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 18, 2014, decision. In his decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s emergency motion for stay of removal and his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed. The request for a stay of removal is moot.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The respondent’s case is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42 (BIA 2006).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he is eligible for reopening because he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that, if his case is reopened, he is otherwise eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). A motion to reopen filed in Immigration Court must generally be filed within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and the motion will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that the evidence offered in the motion is material and not previously available or discoverable at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). In addition, a motion to reopen filed for the purpose of submitting an application for asylum and related relief may be excepted from the time and numeric limitations if the motion establishes “changed country conditions arising in the country ... to which removal has been ordered.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed before the Immigration Judge on August 1, 2014, nearly 4 years after he was previously ordered removed, on November 16, 2010. It is, thus, untimely. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent requests that the proceedings be reopened based on ineffective assistance by his previous counsel. His previous counsel, apparently, withdrew representation on the morning of the merits hearing before the Immigration Judge on November 16, 2010 (Resp. Br. at 5). As noted, motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of a final order. In certain cases, untimely motions are allowed where the respondent demonstrates not only that his due process rights have been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that he has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll, Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). Here, the respondent was placed on notice of any ineffective service on the day his attorney withdrew from representation, the same day the Immigration Judge entered the final decision. Yet, the respondent waited almost 4 years to file the current motion. He has failed to show due diligence in pursuing his rights and has failed to explain this 4 year period. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir. 2008) (even with egregious ineffective assistance, alien must show due diligence); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (same). The respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s observation that at the 2010 hearing, he was informed of his right to apply for asylum and given an opportunity to find new representation (I.J. at 2; Resp. Br. at 5).
 
The respondent is also requesting that the proceedings be reopened based on changed country conditions in his native Bangladesh (Resp. Br. at 9-10). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). The respondent claims that conditions for the Hindu population in Bangladesh have worsened in the time since the original decision in this case (Resp. Br. at 9-10). In support of this claim, he has provided affidavits of family members and recent newspaper articles (Resp. Br. at 9-10; Exhs. H-M). While Hindus may face problems or harassment in Bangladesh, the record fails to provide material evidence of any significant worsening in conditions since 2010, and it fails to demonstrate changed country conditions such that reopening is warranted at this late date. See S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007). In motions to remand or reopen proceedings, the respondent bears a heavy burden in showing such action is warranted. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The evidence presented fails to meet this burden. In this regard, we further observe that the respondent is not eligible for asylum due to his crime (Resp. Br. at 11; Exh. 1), and the Immigration Judge issued an order of removal to the United Kingdom with Bangladesh in the alternative. The Immigration Judge properly denied the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wael M. Ahmad, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Seth B. Fitter
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(E)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)] - Convicted of crime of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse, neglect, or abandonment
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of an aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The Department of Homeland Security appeals from the September 15, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge granting the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings. The respondent opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact only to determine whether such findings are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Netherlands, was admitted to the United States on January 23, 2003, as a lawful permanent resident (I.J. at 1). On July 15, 2013, he was convicted of assault in the fourth degree, in violation of subsection 508.030(1)(a) of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment (I.J. at 1-3). According to that statute, “““A person is guilty of assault in the fourth degree when: (a) He intentionally or wantonly causes physical injury to another person.” The parties have agreed that the term “wantonly,” as used in the statute, corresponds to the common law definition of the term “recklessly” (I.J. at 3-4).
 
Based on the respondent’s conviction, the DHS issued him a Notice to Appear, charging that he was removable under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The DHS subsequently lodged an additional charge under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, charging that the respondent was convicted of a “crime of violence,” for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year, which is an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F).1
 
In a written decision, the Immigration Judge found that the DHS had not established that the respondent had been convicted of either an “aggravated felony” or a “crime of domestic violence, a crime of stalking, or a crime of child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment” because the respondent’s conviction was not for a “crime of violence” (as defined in section 16 of title 18 of the United States Code). See (I.J. at 2-9); see also section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), (E)(i) of the Act. Accordingly, she ordered that these proceedings be terminated (I.J. at 9).
 
*2 On appeal, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge applied the incorrect legal standard in determining that the respondent’s statute of conviction is not “divisible” (DHS Brief on Appeal, dated Nov. 20, 2014, at 3). Specifically, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge should not have applied the divisibility analysis from our recent decision in Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, 26 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 2014), to a case arising within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (DHS Brief on Appeal, dated Nov. 20, 2014, at 8-10). In the alternative, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge misapplied Matter of Chairez-Castrejon to the facts of this case (DHS Brief on Appeal, dated Nov. 20, 2014, at 10-11).
 
To determine whether a particular offense qualifies as a crime of violence, we employ the “categorical approach.” Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 351. This “requires us to focus on the minimum conduct that has a realistic probability of being prosecuted [under the statute], rather than on the facts underlying the respondent’s particular violation of that statute.” Id. (citing Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 1678, 1684-85 (2013)). However, if a statute is “divisible,” we employ a modified categorical approach. See id. at 352.
 
In Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 352-53, the Board acknowledged that our earlier divisibility analysis was inconsistent with the approach announced by the United States Supreme Court in Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276 (2013). Therefore, we adopted the Court’s approach to divisibility, such that
[A] criminal statute is divisible, so as to warrant a modified categorical inquiry, only if (1) it lists multiple discrete offenses as enumerated alternatives or defines a single offense by reference to disjunctive sets of “ “ “elements,” more than one combination of which could support a conviction; and (2) at least one, but not all, of those listed offenses or combinations of disjunctive elements is a categorical match to the relevant generic standard.
 
Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 353 (citing Descamps v. United States, 133 S Ct. at 2281, 2283). Under this approach, an element of an offense is a fact “about a crime which ‘[t]he Sixth Amendment contemplates that a jury--not a sentencing court--will find . . . unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.”DD’ Id. (quoting Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. at 2288).
 
*3 In our decision, we noted that we are not given deference on this issue and, accordingly, we are “bound to apply divisibility consistently with the individual circuits’ interpretation of divisibility under Descamps.” Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 354. However, we also stated that, if a particular circuit court has not applied divisibility under Descamps in a precedential decision, the Board would follow its own understanding of divisibility as set forth in Descamps. Id.
 
We are not aware of any precedential decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit applying divisibility under Descamps, particularly in the mens rea context at issue in this case. In Groves v. United States, 755 F.3d 588, 593 (7th Cir. 2014), the circuit court recognized that “the Supreme Court adopted the divisible/indivisible distinction as discussed [in a prior circuit court case].” Id. (citing Descamps v. United States, supra). However, this statement provides no clear resolution at this point as to how the circuit court will define divisibility post-Descamps.
 
The circuit court’s decision makes only a brief and passing reference to Descamps. Id. Moreover, an application of Descamps was not the dispositive issue in Groves, which primarily concerned a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Groves v. United States, 755 F.3d at 589-90. Inasmuch as the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has yet to interpret divisibility under Descamps, we will apply our own understanding of the Supreme Court’s decision. Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 354; see also Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. at 2282.
 
Consistent with the foregoing, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s statute of conviction is not divisible. Although subsection 508.030(1)(a) lists two mental states that may support a conviction, those mental states are not separate “elements” of the offense because a jury would not necessarily have to decide between them unanimously. Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 353; see also Wells v. Commonwealth, 561 S.W.2d 85, 88 (Ken. 1978) (“[A] verdict can not be successfully attacked upon the ground that the jurors could have believed either of two theories of the case where both interpretations are supported by the evidence and the proof of either beyond a reasonable doubt constitutes the same offense.”). The state of Kentucky “permits conviction without jury agreement as to mental state” in certain cases (DHS Brief on Appeal, dated Nov. 20, 2014, at 11). Therefore, intent and recklessness are merely alternative “means” by which a defendant can commit an assault, not alternative “elements” of the offense. Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 354.
 
*4 The respondent has not been convicted of a “crime of violence” under 18 U.S.C. § 16(a). Because subsection 508.030(1)(a) can be proven by reference to reckless conduct, it does not have as an element the deliberate “““use” of violent physical force against the person or property of another. See Matter of Chairez-Castrejon, supra, at 352. We are prohibited from considering the respondent’s record of conviction to determine whether his particular conduct was intentional or reckless. See Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. at 2293 (“A court may use the modified approach only to determine which alternative element in a divisible statute formed the basis of the defendant’s conviction.”). Accordingly, the Department of Homeland Security has not carried its burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is deportable. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3).
 
The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Department of Homeland Security’s appeal is dismissed.

The term “crime of violence” is defined in relevant part as “an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.” 18 U.S.C. § 16(a) (2012). In this context, the term “use” denotes volition. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9 (2004). The parties agreed that the respondent was not convicted of a felony and, therefore, subsection 16(b) of title 18 of the United States Code does not apply to this case (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 22).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey T. Jones, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 10, 2014, decision denying his motion to terminate proceedings and ordering him removed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent does not contest that he pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance in violation of Texas Health and Safety Code section 481.115(b) and was convicted by the Texas 69th District Court of Moore County, Texas on August 4, 2014 (Exh. 1; I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 2-3). As part of his plea agreement, the respondent waived his right to appeal this conviction (Exh. 2). The respondent was then placed in removal proceedings by the Department of Homeland Security and charged with deportability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), based upon his drug-related offense, other than a single conviction for possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana (Exh. 1). Subsequently, the respondent filed a motion for a new trial and a motion for arrest in judgment based on ineffective assistance of counsel alleging that he was not properly apprised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.1
 
The respondent argues that based on the filing of this motion and subsequent appeal of the denial of this motion, his conviction is not final for immigration purposes. However, we do not agree and affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion for a new trial and motion for arrest in judgment are not a direct appeal, but rather, a collateral attack of the respondent’s conviction. As such, his conviction remains binding and final for immigration purposes unless and until it is overturned by the Texas state court. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); see also Okabe v. INS, 671 F.2d 863 (5th Cir. 1982). Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent’s conviction subjected him to deportability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act and ordered him removed. Furthermore, we see no reason to remand based on a pending appeal of a motion for post-conviction relief. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to remand denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia K. Conkright, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on April 9, 1996, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 26, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). As the respondent did not apply for any form of relief, the Immigration Judge ordered his removal from this country. On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues only that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance to collaterally attack the sexual assault conviction that forms the basis for his removability. However, at no time did the respondent request a continuance before the Immigration Judge. At the final hearing on August 26, 2014, the respondent’s counsel stated that the respondent was pursuing a writ of habeas corpus with the state court (Tr. at 12). However, counsel conceded that the respondent was presently ineligible for any relief from removal, and did not request a continuance (Tr. at 9-14).
 
We decline to remand these removal proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the evidence that the respondent has presented on appeal. Even though the respondent has presented evidence that, subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s decision in this matter, he filed a writ of habeas corpus with the Texas courts, his conviction remains final and effective for immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992) (“The possibility of a decision on any post-conviction motion that has been filed does not affect our finding that the respondent is deportable.”). Moreover, the respondent’s desire to seek post-conviction relief does not amount to “good cause” for a continuance. See Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011). Even though the respondent apparently believes that, in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), his criminal defense attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, “Padilla also does not suggest that immigration proceedings must be stayed while a Padilla-type claim is being pursued in post[-]conviction proceedings.” Milton v. Holder, 425 F.App’x. 407, 409 (5th Cir. 2011). The respondent’s conviction evidently remains undisturbed, as he has yet to indicate that he has received a vacatur. Moreover, the likelihood of success on the respondent’s motion for post-conviction relief is speculative. Thus, inasmuch as the evidence offered on appeal does not establish that, if proceedings were remanded, the outcome of this case would likely be different, we conclude that the respondent has not established that a remand is warranted. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robin N. Miller, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; waiver of inadmissibility
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2013, decision denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility in conjunction with adjustment of status under sections 212(i) and 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(i), 1255,1 We have not received a response from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s ruling that he is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).2 It is conceded that at the respondent’s initial merits hearing on October 25, 2007, the respondent testified falsely that the signature on the application for adjustment of status, Form I-485, was his (I.J.2 at 2; Tr. at 30). The Immigration Judge found that this false statement under oath rendered the respondent inadmissible and that the false statement was “material” to his eligibility for adjustment of status, reasoning that there was no application before the Court in the absence of a properly sworn Form I-485 (I.J.2 at 2-3; Tr. at 111). The respondent filed a new application for adjustment of status at the remanded hearing. Additional evidence was submitted and further testimony of both the respondent and his wife was taken.
 
The test for materiality of a misrepresentation is generally whether the respondent potentially would be inadmissible or ineligible for relief under the true facts, or whether the misrepresentation would tend to cut off a line of inquiry relevant to the respondent’s eligibility for admission or relief. See Matter of S- and B-C-, 9 I&N Dec. 436, 447 (A.G. 1961). The Supreme Court’s iteration of the materiality of a false representation in denaturalization proceedings is instructive in assessing a similar provision. In Kungys v. U.S., 485 U.S. 759 (1988), the Immigration and Naturalization Service sought to have the respondent’s citizenship revoked based upon false statements made as to his date and place of birth. The Court ruled that a false representation is material when it would lead to a “natural tendency to end a possible line of questioning or otherwise influence a decision on his application.” Kungys v. U.S., supra, at 772. See also Matter of P-S-H-, 26 I&N Dec. 329, 336-38 (BIA 2014); Matter of M-L-M-A-, 26 I&N Dec. 360 (BIA 2014).
 
*2 It is obvious that if the respondent had truthfully told the Immigration Judge that the signature on the application was not his, further inquiry would have been made at the first hearing. Nonetheless, there is no finding by the Immigration Judge that the information in the original Form I-485 was false or misleading. Nor is the identity of the signer of the original Form I-485 relevant to the respondent’s ultimate admissibility or eligibility for relief, particularly in the context of a substantiated claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, we do not sustain the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent was inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. Thus, we sustain the appeal and conclude that the respondent did not need a waiver under section 212(i) of the Act in order to be eligible for adjustment. In light of our decision in this regard the issue of whether a continuance should have been granted is rendered moot.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision did not address the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status, in the event the waiver was found not to be necessary. The Immigration Judge did not make a credibility finding or a decision on whether the respondent warrants the favorable exercise of discretion. See section 245(a) of the Act. Therefore, we will remand the record for further factual findings and a new decision.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court.

This matter was previously before us and was remanded by order dated August 18, 2009, for additional fact finding and further consideration of the application for relief. The Immigration Judge’s decision of February 20, 2013, will be referred to as “I.J.2”; the earlier decision of October 25, 2007, will be referred to as “I.J.1”. The Immigration Judge initially denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status on October 25, 2007, finding the respondent and his wife had not testified credibly and that they were engaged in a fraudulent marriage (I.J.1 at 2). The case was remanded to the Immigration Judge upon a finding that the respondent had established prejudice due to ineffective assistance of his prior attorney. Upon remand, the parties were given the opportunity to supplement the record regarding the application for relief.

Any alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act is inadmissible.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arturo Suarez-Silverio, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Silver
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On October 16, 2014, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on May 4, 2001. On November 3, 2014, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind which the Department of Homeland Security opposes. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3), 1003.2(b)(4)(ii). The motion will be denied.
 
In our prior order, we noted that the respondent provided no meaningful explanation for his failure to appear at the removal hearing on May 1, 2001. The respondent now claims that his former attorney did not properly investigate the facts of his case, and the respondent asserts, for the first time, that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing.
 
Initially, we find that the respondent has not offered evidence of compliance with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See Motion Exhibits. See also Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132 (3d Cir. 2001). Further, ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent on the face of the record. See Lu v. Ashcroft, supra, at 134. Indeed, the respondent has not shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of a former attorney’s handling of his case. See Fadiga v. Attorney General, 488 F.3d 142, 157, 159-60 (3rd Cir. 2007); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. Although the respondent maintains that he did not receive notice of the hearing, he has not elaborated any claim that notice of the hearing was improperly served.1
 
In sum, the respondent has not set forth a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Moreover, he has neither shown that notice of the removal hearing was improper, nor provided a persuasive explanation for his failure to appear at the hearing. See sections 240(b)(5)(A), (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(A), (C). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion, which is untimely and number-barred, will be denied. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

The Notice to Appear was personally served on the respondent on October 23, 2000, and the warning regarding the requirement to notify the Immigration Court of any change of address was provided to the respondent in Spanish at that time. See Exhibit 1. The record also reveals that on February 22, 2001, the Immigration Judge granted a motion to change venue which was accompanied by a form indicating that the respondent’s address had changed and that the respondent was reminded of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court of any change of address. See Exhibits 2 and 3. Based on the evidence before us, it appears that the Notice of Hearing, which was not returned as undeliverable, was properly mailed to the respondent at his address of record. See section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a).

Fatai Suleman, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 24, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See generally, Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). For the reasons articulated in his decision, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established an exception to the time limitations for filing a motion to reopen or that sua sponte reopening is warranted.2 See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board exercises its sua sponte authority “sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limited in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.”)
 
The respondent has not shown that his prior representatives provided ineffective representation or, even if they did, that he was prejudiced by it (I.J. at 7, 8). Moreover, he has not shown that he exercised due diligence in his removal proceedings (I.J. at 7). Accordingly, he has not shown that a truly exceptional situation warrants reopening. Matter of G-D-, supra. For these reasons, we further conclude that the respondent has not established that ineffective assistance of counsel warrants the equitable tolling of the filing deadline for his motion to reopen. See Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011).
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that changed conditions arising in Nigeria provide an exception to the filing deadline for his motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). The respondent has not presented evidence from which it is reasonable to conclude that conditions in Nigeria have materially changed since the time of his hearing in such a way that would provide a factual basis that did not previously exist for his claim for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s contention on appeal that the Immigration Judge required “a conclusive showing” of eligibility for asylum for the purpose of establishing that reopening is warranted3 (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). Rather, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent has not shown prima facie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture (I.J. at 9-12). See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988) (a motion to reopen may be denied when a movant does not establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought). For these reasons, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision and will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The record reflects that although the Immigration Judge dated his decision July 7, 2014, it was issued on July 24, 2014. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal was timely filed.

2

The Immigration Judge did not consider the respondent’s motion to reopen barred by the number limitations for filing motions to reopen (I.J. at 8).

We note that as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent would be ineligible for asylum in any event. Sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). The respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are not related to the Immigration Judge’s January 29, 2003, determination that he is removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bruce D. Imbacuan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Italy, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 9, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Before the Immigration Judge, on June 18, 2014, the respondent was granted a continuance to enable him to pursue post-conviction relief with regard to the conviction that serves as the basis for removal, and renders him ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent alleged that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of this conviction, and he had filed a motion to vacate it.2 However, on July 9, 2014, the Immigration Judge denied a further continuance (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent challenges denial of the continuance. However, the respondent also indicates that the motion to vacate the conviction was denied.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).3 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent was free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction did not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security=s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Derek Cavada, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 16, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on June 2, 1999. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent has two timely motions to reconsider filed on his behalf by two different attorneys. Attorney Meighan L. Vargas filed a timely motion to reconsider on the respondent’s behalf alleging ineffective assistance of counsel of the respondent’s prior representation below and on appeal by the Aponte and Associates firm. Simultaneously, Derek Cavada of Aponte and Associates filed a timely motion to reconsider on the respondent’s behalf. Subsequently, on September 22, 2014, Attorney Vargas withdrew her representation of the respondent before the Board.1 Therefore, we will deny the motion to reconsider filed by Attorney Vargas as moot.
 
Turning to the motion to reconsider filed by Derek Cavada of Aponte and Associates. This motion does not convince us that reconsideration of our previous decision is warranted. A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent largely raises the same or similar arguments in the motion to reconsider as were raised in his prior motion to reopen and subsequent appeal. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not rebutted the presumption of delivery of the Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) in his proceedings and dismissed his appeal. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal . . .”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 28, 2013, decision denying his request for a continuance and ordering him removed. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that these removal proceedings were instituted with the filing of a Notice to Appear in November 2007. Pursuant to the respondent’s concession, the Immigration Judge found him removable as charged (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 3). Thereafter, following a change of venue, these proceedings were continued nine times over the course of more than 5 years to await adjudication of two visa petitions consecutively filed by the respondent’s United States citizen spouse. At all except the final hearing in this case, the respondent was represented by counsel. On the date on which the Immigration Judge issued his decision, both visa petitions filed by the respondent’s spouse had been denied, and the appeals of those denials had been dismissed. The respondent requested an additional continuance in order to pursue a petition as an abused spouse of a United States citizen, Form I-360, with the United States Immigration and Citizenship Services (“USCIS”). The Immigration Judge denied the request for a continuance and, after ascertaining that the respondent did not seek voluntary departure, ordered the respondent removed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by finding that section 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c) would bar any subsequent visa petition filed on his behalf because the Board did not reach the merits of either appeal as they were dismissed on procedural grounds. He also contends on appeal that his application for relief was materially prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and that the Immigration Judge erred by denying his request for a continuance because he was unrepresented and because he had a pending I-360 petition.
 
*2 Contrary to the respondent’s contention on appeal, the Immigration Judge did not make a finding that section 204(c) of the Act would necessarily bar the approval of a visa petition filed on his behalf. Rather, the Immigration Judge noted that the DHS had found that the section 204(c) bar applied (I.J. at 4). The Immigration Judge further noted that the respondent had been unable to establish prima facie eligibility for permanent residency (I.J. at 4).
 
The respondent contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in visa petition proceedings relating to the petitions filed by his spouse on his behalf because the appeals of the USCIS’s denial of the visa petitions were both dismissed on procedural grounds resulting from errors by the attorneys who filed them. However, visa petition proceedings are separate and apart from removal proceedings. Matter of Aurelio, 19 I&N Dec. 458, 460 (BIA 1987). Moreover, only the respondent’s spouse as the petitioner, not the respondent as the beneficiary, is the affected party in those visa petition proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(2); see also Matter of Sano, 19 I&N Dec. 299 (BIA 1985); Matter of DaBaase, 16 I&N Dec. 720 (BIA 1979); Matter of Kurys, 11 I&N Dec. 315 (BIA 1965). Even if we were to consider the respondent as an affected party for the purposes of this appeal, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by the attorneys’ errors. The denial of a visa petition for failure to meet the required burden of proof does not preclude the filing of another petition by the same petitioner on behalf of the same beneficiary. However, the respondent has not presented evidence from which it is reasonable to conclude that there is any likelihood that he would be the beneficiary of an approved visa petition that would support an application for adjustment of status.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s contention on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred by not granting him an additional continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent several lengthy continuances (I.J. at 2-3). At the time the Immigration Judge issued his decision, there was no indication in the record that any visa petition filed on the respondent’s behalf had been approved or remained unadjudicated. Moreover, the record does not include, and the respondent has not presented on appeal, evidence that he has filed a Form I-360 with the USCIS. Furthermore, although the respondent was unrepresented at the final hearing, he had been represented by counsel for many years. Under these circumstances, the record does not support the conclusion that a continuance was warranted as a result of the respondent appearing pro se at the last hearing. Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent had not established good cause for an additional continuance. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983) (holding that a decision denying a motion for a continuance will not be reversed on appeal unless the alien establishes, by a full and specific articulation of the particular facts involved or evidence which he would have presented, that the denial caused him actual prejudice and harm, and materially affected the outcome of his case).
 
*3 The respondent has submitted additional evidence with his appeal brief, comprising documentation related to the visa petitions filed by his spouse. The Board generally does not consider evidence that was not previously considered because we are an appellate body and, accordingly, we review the record that was created before the Immigration Judge. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). We therefore construe the respondent’s submission of additional evidence with his appeal brief as a motion to remand, which must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen. To warrant remand, the motion must be supported by evidence that was previously unavailable and that “““would likely change the result in the case.” Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). This evidence, which reflects that the visa petitions were denied and the appeals dismissed, is unlikely to change the result in his case. See Matter of Coelho, supra, at 472. Accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated that a remand of the record is warranted based on this additional evidence. See Matter of Coelho, supra, at 471. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Eva L. Carrasco, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondents appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 10, 2013, reissuing his decision dated November 7, 2012, denying their application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). As the respondents’ applications were filed after May 11, 2005, they are governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. Matter of Almanza Arenas, 24 I&N Dec. 771, 774 75 (BIA 2009).
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondents, natives and citizens of the Philippines, removable as charged (I.J. Dec. dated November 7, 2012, at 1; Tr. at 15-21, 26-32, 36-37). The Immigration Judge found the respondents ineligible for adjustment of status under sections 245(a) and 245(i) because they did not (other than through no fault of their own or for technical reasons) maintain continuous lawful status as required by section 245(c)(2) of the Act (I.J. Dec. dated November 7, 2012, at 1-2).
 
We have considered the respondent’s appellate arguments. However, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondents have not maintained the continuous lawful status necessary for adjustment of status. See section 245(c)(2) of the Act. The respondents’ period of lawful status terminated on the date their nonimmigrant status expired. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(d)(1)(ii) (“lawful immigration status” refers to the immigration status of, inter alia, an alien admitted to the United States in nonimmigrant status whose initial period of admission has not expired or whose nonimmigrant status has been extended). The respondents do not dispute that they failed to maintain lawful status (Respondent’s Brief at 10).
 
The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondents’ argument that their failure to maintain continuous lawful status since entry into the United States was through no fault of their own or for technical reasons due to their reliance on the incorrect advice of counsel before the USCIS. Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that erroneous advice received outside and in advance of immigration proceedings did not affect fairness of proceedings and did not provide basis for reopening due to ineffective assistance of counsel). The regulations define the phrase “other than through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons,” explicitly limiting the meaning of that phrase to four scenarios. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(d)(2). Even assuming, arguendo, that the respondents established ineffective assistance of former counsel in providing advice on maintaining their lawful status,1 such a scenario does not fall within one of the enumerated circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(d)(2) (providing that the meaning of the phrase “(other than through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons)” is limited to those circumstances described in the regulation). See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003); Colmenar v. INS, 210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Thus, the respondents are not eligible for adjustment of status because they did not maintain continuous lawful status as required by section 245(c)(2) of the Act, and they cannot benefit from the exemption in section 245(k) of the Act because the period during which they were not in lawful status exceeded 180 days. See section 245(k)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(k)(2)(A). We therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s pretermission of the respondents’ applications for adjustment of status and will dismiss the appeal.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondents’ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on their failure to comply with the procedural requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, former counsel’s legal representation before the USCIS and prior to these removal proceedings, is beyond the scope of these removal proceedings. Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1050-51 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding that “the Fifth Amendment simply does not apply to the preparation and filing of a petition that does not relate to the fundamental fairness of an ongoing [removal] proceeding.”); Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that “unfortunate immigration-law advice” prior to a removal proceeding does not taint the fairness of the removal hearing itself in violation of the Fifth Amendment), amended by 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Bambl, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reissuance
 
*1 On December 14, 2000, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s January 25, 1999, decision, and on October 1, 2014, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen the proceedings. The motion, which is untimely by nearly 14 years, will be denied. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The motion does not demonstrate that an exception to the filing deadline applies or that an exceptional situation is present in this case to warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3).
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks equitable tolling of the filing deadline, he has not shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent asserts that former counsel did not inform him that an appeal had been filed and dismissed. He further claims that until 2014, former counsel led him to believe that his case remained pending. The respondent, however, has neither contested his removability nor identified any form of relief for which he may have been eligible either at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision or during the period in which a timely motion to reopen could have been filed in this case. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (explaining that to demonstrate prejudice, the alien must show that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”).
 
The respondent also seeks reopening for reissuance of our prior order to enable him to file a petition for judicial review. The respondent, however, has not alleged any error in the Board’s affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision nor has the respondent demonstrated that reissuance is warranted. Therefore, we decline to reissue our prior order. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992) (noting that motions to reopen immigration proceedings are disfavored, especially where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan R. Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Nielsen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 30, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
At the hearing, the respondent requested a continuance of proceedings to enable him to pursue post-conviction relief with regard to the November 12, 2013, conviction that serves as the basis for removal, and renders him ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent alleged that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of this conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) objected to a continuance (Tr. at 8-11).2 The Immigration Judge denied the requested continuance (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent challenges denial of the continuance. However, the respondent does not indicate that the conviction has been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

Marc A. Jones
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves the Board to reopen his removal proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings regarding his application for adjustment of status. Sections 240(c)(7), 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7); 1255(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). We will deny the motion.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We will deny the motion to reopen because the respondent has not presented new, previously unavailable evidence that is material to his application for adjustment of status. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). In our April 7, 2014, decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application in the exercise of discretion because the respondent’s criminal history outweighed the positive equities in the record. See Portillo-Rendon v. Holder, 662 F.3d 815 (7th Cir. 2011).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen cites the equities in his favor, particularly his family ties in the United States, and is supported with a number of letters from friends and family, including a letter from the respondent’s United States citizen wife (Respondent’s Motion at 10-11 and Exhs. B-C). The respondent cites the fact that he and his wife now have twin sons, an equity that was not presented during the February 7, 2012, individual hearing below because the respondent’s wife was 1-month pregnant at the time (Respondent’s Motion at 10-11). The respondent overlooks the fact that the Board applied de novo review to the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 7, 2012, decision, and fully considered the positive equities established in the record, including the fact that the respondent became a father to twin sons during the pendency of the appeal, as well as evidence that he stopped drinking alcohol and completed a state-sponsored traffic safety program to regain his driving privileges (April 7, 2014, Order at 2). We nevertheless held that the respondent’s criminal history, which involved numerous serious driving offenses, including one during the pendency of his removal proceedings where he drove under the influence and flipped his car, outweighed the equities in his favor, and we dismissed his appeal (see April 7, 2014, Board Decision).1
 
*2 The respondent also contends that the development of political unrest and hostilities in the eastern portion of Ukraine between the Ukrainian government and those aligned with Russia is evidence of changed country conditions that supports reopening (Respondent’s Motion at 10-11 and Exhs. D-F). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent’s argument is without merit because he does not seek reopening in order to pursue a claim for asylum and related relief. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007). Moreover, even if he did seek reopening to pursue asylum and related relief, we would deny the motion because generalized conditions affecting large segments of the population do not, by themselves, prove that an individual faces persecution. Raghunathan v. Holder, 604 F.3d 371, 378 (7th Cir. 2010).
 
The respondent also seeks reopening on the grounds that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Motion at 3-4, 11). The respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See also Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 368-70 (7th Cir. 2012) (no demonstration of ineffective assistance of counsel when the respondent fails to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to support such a claim because he has not presented any evidence that would change the outcome. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640 (successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing that the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance). We reviewed de novo the equities in the respondent’s favor, including the equities that developed and were presented on appeal, and we decided that the respondent’s criminal history outweighed those positive equities (see April 7, 2014, Board Decision). The respondent’s motion to reopen presents no evidence that would change our calculation, and he has therefore not demonstrated any prejudice from his prior attorney’s assistance.
 
Finally, the respondent argues that his due process rights were violated in the prior proceedings (Respondent’s Motion at 4-5, 10). The respondent’s argument is without merit as he was provided a full and fair hearing in support of his application for adjustment of status, and he has made no showing that he was in any manner prevented from fully presenting his case. Hamid v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 642, 645-46 (7th Cir. 2005) (successful due process challenge requires applicant to show that he was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and that the deprivation potentially affected the outcome). Neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board abused its discretion in deciding that the respondent’s criminal history outweigh the equities in his favor. See Marinov v. Holder, supra, at 368 (no demonstration of abuse of discretion unless Board decision is “made without rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.”).
 
*3 For these reasons, we will deny the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

In this regard, the respondent’s motion is more akin to a motion to reconsider as he essentially argues that we should have weighed the equities differently, and in his favor. The respondent’s argument is without support as he has not demonstrated any material error of law or fact in our April 7, 2014, decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).

APPLICATION: Reopen
 
*1 ORDER:
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Brazil. On June 10, 2014, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal and extended the time within which he may voluntarily depart.1 On August 8, 2014, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Since the respondent filed his motion prior to expiration of the voluntary departure period, his grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1). The Department of Homeland Security objects to the granting of this motion.
 
The respondent seeks reopening based on a number of allegations listed by new counsel regarding the performance of former counsel. The motion shall be denied because the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has not submitted sufficient documentary evidence indicating that he filed a state bar complaint or that former counsel was notified of the complaint and afforded the opportunity to respond to the respondent’s specific claims. Former counsel’s response would have been particularly helpful here in assessing the respondent’s allegations. Since the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the motion is denied. The request for a stay is denied as moot.

The Immigration Judge mistakenly granted the respondent a period of voluntary departure beyond the statutorily mandated period of 60 days (Cf. I.J. Dec. at 12 with I.J. Order dated 10/9/12). Section 240B(b)(2), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2). Since the respondent’s voluntary departure grant has been automatically terminated by the filing of this motion, the error is moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George E. Crimarco, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 27, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on September 12, 2005. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2013). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion and judgment. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s determination that, although ineffective assistance of counsel is an exceptional circumstance that may warrant reopening, he did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent argues that compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is impossible where the individual who gave ineffective assistance is a notario, rather than an attorney. Additionally, he asserts that proceedings should have been reopened sua sponte to allow him to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver.
 
We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed more than 8 years after the entry of the removal order, was untimely (I.J. at 1-2). Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (requiring that a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of removal based on exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the entry of the removal order). The respondent has not shown that he acted diligently, such that the Immigration Judge should have equitably tolled the deadline for filing a motion to reopen.
 
Moreover, compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is not impossible even in cases involving notarios or other individuals who provide legal advice but are not licensed attorneys. At a minimum, an aggrieved individual can submit an affidavit setting forth the details of the agreement entered into with the notario and notify the notario of the allegations against him and provide him the opportunity to respond. Further, in many states, an aggrieved individual can complain to appropriate disciplinary authorities, who may choose to sanction the individual for unauthorized practice of law. See, e.g., Consumer Pamphlet: Filing an Unlicensed Practice of Law Complaint, Florida Bar (last revised March 2014), available at http:// www.floridabar.org/TFB/TFBConsum.nsf/48e76203493b82ad852567090070c9b9/59cac57c8be11c2085256b2f006c58a5? OpenDocument; Online Complaint Form, Texas UPL Committee, http:// www.txuplc.org/complaint/Home/Index (last visited Oct. 7, 2014). In situations where a bar complaint is not possible or practical, Matter of Lozada only requires an explanation of why such a complaint was not filed. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Thus, we see no justification for the respondent’s failure to comply with Matter of Lozada.
 
*2 In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation warranting reopening sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Becoming eligible for an immigration benefit years after the entry of a removal order is not an exceptional situation, and does not warrant the extraordinary equitable remedy of circumventing the statutory and regulatory restrictions on reopening.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard H. G. Cunningham, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Guatemala. On January 31, 2012, while represented by former counsel, the respondent conceded removability and did not seek relief from removal (I.J. at 1). Therefore, the Immigration Judge ordered his removal and the respondent waived appeal (I.J. at 1). The respondent now appeals the August 2, 2013, denial of a motion to reopen he filed with the Immigration Court on July 22, 2013. The Immigration Judge concluded that the motion was untimely and not subject to an exception to the time bar. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The January 31, 2012, decision ordering the respondent’s removal became final upon the waiver of appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39. As the respondent did not file his motion to reopen within 90 days of this date, we affirm the holding that the motion to reopen is time-barred (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Furthermore, the motion is not to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture on the basis of previously unavailable evidence of changed country conditions. The respondent thus has not shown eligibility for the exception to the time bar at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i) (I.J. at 1).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that since the hearing, he has become eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. However, this form of relief is granted in the discretion of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) after filing of Form I-821D. Immigration Judges and the Board do not have jurisdiction to grant Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The respondent has not explained how the possibility of USCIS granting his Form I-821D qualifies him for an exception to the time bar in removal proceedings (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Moreover, while the respondent submitted a Form I-821D with his motion, he has not presented evidence that it was filed with USCIS or shown prima facie eligibility for deferred action (I.J. at 1). Cf. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that a continuance may be warranted where an alien has demonstrated that he is the beneficiary of a pending immigrant visa petition and established a likelihood of success on an application for adjustment of status).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent states that his former attorney committed ineffective assistance by waiving his right to pursue other avenues of relief. In support of this allegation, the respondent submits a personal affidavit. The respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-48 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (reaffirming the Matter of Lozada framework). Also, since the respondent has not articulated prima facie eligibility for any form of relief available in removal proceedings, he has not shown prejudice. See Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994). Therefore, the respondent has not demonstrated that tolling of the 90-day reopening deadline is appropriate on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 134, 129-30 (2d Cir. 2000).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mariusz Zdyrski, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah E. Zeld
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Poland, has filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 19, 2013, denying his request for a continuance. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The factual findings of the Immigration Judge are reviewed to determine whether they are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). All other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges, including legal and discretionary determinations and applications of law to fact, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We find no clear error in the factual findings of the Immigration Judge in this case. Upon de novo review of the questions of law, discretion, and judgment presented, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly noted that the Notice to Appear was issued in February 2009; the first hearing was held in March 2009, and the respondent appeared with counsel and was granted a continuance for attorney preparation; and continuances were granted on October 26, 2010 and August 23, 2011, so that counsel could provide proof of what efforts were being made in pursuing a U-Visa for the respondent (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 4, 9, 11, 14). On September 20, 2011, prior counsel submitted a status letter to the court regarding the potential of a U-Visa for the respondent, indicating that the agencies they had contacted no longer wished to pursue the matter or act on the respondent’s behalf (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 27; Status Letter from Y. Judd Azulay of Azulay Seiden Law Group dated September 20, 2011). On February 7, 2012 a master calendar hearing was held at which the respondent appeared with a new attorney and requested a continuance so that he could pursue a visa petition filing by the respondent’s brother and a request for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by DHS (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 16-20). The Immigration Judge warned both the attorney and the respondent directly that this was the last continuance in the respondent’s case, and that if he did not complete applications for relief by the date of the next scheduled hearing, he would only have voluntary departure as available relief at the final hearing (Tr. at 20-21). On January 28, 2013, the Immigration Judge granted a motion to withdraw to the respondent’s new attorney (Motion to Withdraw, Jesus Ruiz-Velasco, Esquire, dated January 28, 2013). At the final master calendar hearing held on February 19, 2013, the respondent appeared pro se and requested a continuance to find another attorney (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 24). The Immigration Judge then asked several questions and determined that the respondent was not eligible for cancellation of removal, that the respondent was seeking a continuance to await his brother naturalizing and filing a visa petition on his behalf, and to await possible comprehensive immigration reform legislation, and the respondent chose not to pursue voluntary departure (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 24-26).
 
*2 The respondent failed to establish good cause for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355 (BIA 1983); see generally Calma v. Holder, 663 F.3d 868 (7th Cir. 2011) (I.J. consideration of speculative nature of respondent’s hopes and lengthy amount of time it would take for processing applications was appropriate); Afzal v. Holder, 559 F.3d 677 (7th Cir. 2009) (jurisdiction to review continuance denials); Hadayat v. Gonzales, 458 F.3d 659 (7th Cir. 2006) (no sibling visa immediately available); compare Subhan v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir. 2004) (continuance denial based only on length of proceedings not upheld). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that a continuance was not warranted where the respondent was not eligible for any relief on the date of the last hearing, no applications or petitions were pending or had been approved, and the hope of comprehensive immigration reform by Congress was merely speculative (I.J. at 3).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, we do not find that he was denied “right to counsel,” especially where his case had been pending for 4 years, his hearings had been continued several times, and he had been represented by various attorneys at all but his last hearing, which was the result of an attorney withdrawal 3 weeks before the hearing, of which the respondent was fully aware (Resp. Br. at 3-4; I.J. at 1-3; Motion to Withdraw). See, e.g., Matter of Compean, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (aliens in removal proceedings have a statutory privilege to retain private counsel but they have no constitutional, statutory, or regulatory right to counsel). For the same reasons, we find that Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012), is not applicable here (Resp. Br. at 4).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not shown any prejudice which resulted from the denial of a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, supra. To date, he has not shown that he has any pending prima facie approvable applications for relief from removal or any approved applications. Id.
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondent has not shown such (Respondent’s Appeal Brief; I.J. at 1-3; Tr. at 1-28). See Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra; Matter of Sibrun, supra.
 
*3 To the extent the respondent is claiming ineffective assistance by one or more of his prior attorneys, he has not complied with any of the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Also, we are not persuaded that there was any per se ineffective assistance of counsel in this case, regarding pursuit of a U-Visa or otherwise (Resp. Br. at 5; I.J. at 1-3; Tr. at 1-21; Status Letter; Motion to Withdraw).
 
Finally, the respondent has proffered new evidence during the pendency of his appeal, to wit: e-mail correspondence between the respondent’s niece and Attorney Ruiz-Velasco. We deem this to constitute a motion to remand. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). However, we are not persuaded that consideration of the new evidence would likely change the outcome in this case; therefore, the motion to remand will be denied. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pablo Rodriguez, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on May 11, 2004, at which time we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider our previous decision dated November 17, 2003. The respondent has now filed an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen proceedings on July 14, 2014. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he received from representatives during his prior proceedings before the Immigration Judge and this Board in 2002 and 2003. In so arguing, the respondent also requests a remand to apply for adjustment of status.1 However, the respondent submitted a similar ineffective assistance of counsel claim before this Board in 2004, and he has provided no valid reason for us to reconsider his claim at this time. While the respondent argues that he is now eligible for adjustment of status, the respondent has not demonstrated that his current claimed eligibility for adjustment of status was, in any way, affected by his prior attorneys’ actions or inactions in 2002 and 2003. Further, the respondent also cannot prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as the ultimate relief he is seeking is discretionary in nature. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
Lastly, the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). While we sympathize with the respondent’s desire to remain in the United States, becoming potentially eligible for adjustment is common and is not generally a basis for granting an untimely motion to reopen. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. David Swaim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Zimbabwe, appeals the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2012, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent contends that he has submitted sufficient evidence to establish that his prior counsel, Ms. Cynthia K. Rigney, Esquire (formerly Cynthia K. Velarde), committed ineffective assistance by not reserving his right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to continue proceedings on June 19, 2012 (Resp. Br. (11/05/12) at 2). He also argues that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen violated his due process rights to a fundamentally fair proceeding (Resp. Br. at 4). Mr. J. David Swaim, Esquire, respondent’s current counsel before the Board, is the managing partner of the firm for which Ms. Rigney was employed when she was the respondent’s counsel of record before the Immigration Court in June 2012 (I.J. at 2).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings as the respondent did not comply with the requirements to establish ineffective assistance by Ms. Rigney, and that the actions of Ms. Rigney did not constitute ineffective assistance (I.J. at 1-2). We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2012, decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The respondent has not submitted a formal grievance with the appropriate state bar disciplinary authority regarding the performance of his prior counsel, and contends that such a formal grievance is not required to establish a claim of ineffective assistance (I.J. at 2; Resp. Br. at 10-11). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (an ineffective assistance claim should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not). The filing of a state bar complaint, containing the notification of breaches of professional conduct, not only serves to deter meritless claims of ineffective representation but also highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40; Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996), aff’d by Rivera v. INS, 122 F.3d 1062 (4th Cir. 1997). In Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a Board decision that denied a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien did not establish he had met all requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, supra. The Fifth Circuit explicitly considered precedents of the Ninth Circuit that found a claimant need not strictly comply with all the Matter of Lozada requirements to establish ineffective assistance. Id. The Fifth Circuit rejected the reasoning in these decisions and affirmed that compliance with the Matter of Lozada requirements was needed to demonstrate ineffective assistance. Id.
 
*2 We are not persuaded by the respondent’s explanations on appeal that a grievance to the Texas state bar is not required in the current case. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. The respondent has not established through objective evidence that he does not have the resources to pursue a disciplinary complaint against his former counsel (Resp. Br. at 12). In addition, the “““confidential” nature of disciplinary proceedings before the Texas state bar or the time it would take to resolve a claim are not valid excuses for failure to file the claim (Resp. Br. at 12). See Bouchikhi v. Holder, 676 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
Furthermore, the prior counsel’s tactical decision to waive appeal, after the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to continue to seek adjustment of status based on a third visa petition by the same spouse, which was contrary to the managing partner’s strategy for the case, does not indicate ineffective assistance (I.J. at 1-2; Motion to Reopen (08/13/12) at 2, item 10).1 See Morales v. Thaler, 714 F.3d 295, 305 (5th Cir. 2013), cert. denied 134 S. Ct. 393 (2013) (a counsel’s legitimate and reasonable tactical decisions, that may ultimately have an adverse effect on a client’s case, do not establish ineffective assistance). Moreover, the Immigration Judge, who the respondent and his prior counsel appeared before in June 2012, assessed the claims presented in the sworn statements and found that he was unable to conclude that Ms. Rigney disobeyed the respondent’s instructions (I.J. at 2; Resp. Br. at 8). See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 454 (BIA 2011) (explaining that an Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole and is not required to accept a respondent’s account where other plausible views of the evidence are supported by the record).
 
The respondent contends that his former attorney’s actions were unreasonable as he had established good cause to warrant a grant of a continuance in order for his spouse to pursue a visa petition on his behalf (Resp. Br. at 7-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23. The spouse’s two previous visa petitions had been denied and there is no showing in the record to establish facts that would demonstrate that it is likely the third visa petition would be successful (I.J. at 1). See Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009).
 
As the respondent has not met his burden to establish that Ms. Rigney provided ineffective assistance in June 2012, we need not address the respondent’s contentions that the denial of his motion to reopen has prejudiced his federal district court case against the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) (Notice of Appeal, Attachment at 8-10). Moreover, the respondent’s contentions about the USCIS’s processing of visa petitions, and any actions of the federal court, are not within the purview of the Board to evaluate.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. Manuel Sanchez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kori LaPoint
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 5, 2013, written decision denying his application voluntary departure as abandoned, cancelling a hearing scheduled for May 8, 2013, and ordering the respondent’s removal from the United States. The respondent has also filed, through his new counsel, a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In response, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved for summary affirmance and expressed its opposition to the motion. We will dismiss the appeal and deny the motion.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. We find that the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent abandoned his opportunity to apply for relief from removal by not complying with the Immigration Judge’s November 14, 2012, order to file, no later than March 1, 2013, a written brief stating whether he was interested in seeking voluntary departure (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 15-16; Immigration Judge’s Record of Master Calendar Pre-Trial Appearance and Order, Form EOIR-55, dated November 14, 2012). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (providing that the Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications for relief and that applications not filed within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge shall be deemed waived). The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 1979), modified, Matter of R-R-, supra.
 
The respondent initially argued, when he filed his appeal brief through the same counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge, that the Immigration Judge erred in not entertaining his previously submitted request for voluntary departure and that there was ambiguity in the instructions pertaining to the deadline imposed, which both parties understood was not for a request of voluntary departure, but for additional applications for relief (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 2-10). We disagree. As argued by the DHS in its brief in response to the respondent’s appeal brief, the Immigration Judge’s instructions were clear and the DHS understood that the March 1, 2013, deadline was set for the respondent to decide whether he wanted to request voluntary departure (DHS’s Reply Brief at 1-2; Tr. at 15-16). Moreover, we note that the respondent, who is now represented by new counsel, seems to have withdrawn this particular argument as he now asserts that his prior counsel “failed to submit the written request for [v]oluntary [d]eparture,” resulting in the Immigration Judge’s determination that he “had abandoned my request for” such form of relief (Respondent’s Affidavit accompanying the Motion to Reopen, at 3; see also Motion to Reopen at 2, 6, 9).
 
*2 Given the foregoing, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s application for voluntary departure as abandoned because of the respondent’s noncompliance with the March 1, 2013, deadline set by the Immigration Judge in his November 14, 2012, order.
 
We will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. We agree with the DHS that the respondent has not complied with the requirement set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), of indicating whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate State bar and, if not, why not (DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 1-2). Additionally, while the respondent has submitted proof that he informed his prior counsel of the allegations he is now making against him, we note that the date on that particular letter indicates that the letter was sent, at the latest, only four days prior to the respondent’s filing of his motion to remand. Thus, we are not satisfied that this communication suffices as proof that the respondent’s prior counsel was given an adequate opportunity to respond to the allegations being made against him. Also, while the respondent argues in his motion that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s failure to advise him that he could file an application for cancellation of removal, the respondent has not submitted such an application with his motion nor sufficiently identified the evidence that would establish that he is prima facie eligible for this or any other form of relief from removal. As such, we are unable to find that the respondent was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s handling of this matter. For these reasons, we will deny the respondent’s motion.
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: VILI ALOFA
File: AXXX XX1 180 - Honolulu, HI

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Burton D. Gould, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Heith M. Kaneshige
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Samoa, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 24, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal. On appeal, the respondent challenges removability and says he was denied his right to counsel and a fair hearing. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Respondents in immigration proceedings have the statutory and regulatory “““privilege of being represented” by counsel of their choice at no expense to the Government. See sections 240(b)(4)(A), 292 of the Act; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.16(b), 1240.3, 1240.10(a), 1240.11(c)(1)(iii). In order to meaningfully effectuate the privilege, the Immigration Judge must grant a reasonable and realistic amount of time and provide a fair opportunity for a respondent to seek, speak with, and retain counsel. See Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888, 889-890 (BIA 2012). See also sections 239(a)(1)(E) and 239(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1)(E); (b)(1).
 
In the present case, after advising the respondent of his right to counsel and providing him a list of attorneys who could help him, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a 1-month continuance to find an attorney (Tr. at 6, 10). At that time, the respondent said he was unable to hire an attorney and wished to represent himself (Tr. at 13). The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent waived his statutory and regulatory privilege of legal representation.1 Had the respondent requested a continuance or advised the Immigration Judge that he still wished to try to retain counsel, good cause for a continuance would have been shown. See Matter of C-B-, supra. However, the respondent did not do either. Consequently, we find that the statutory and regulatory privilege of legal representation was waived.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent also claims that his due process rights were violated because of allegedly faulty translation of the advisals of his rights at the removal hearing. An alien who faces removal is entitled to a full and fair removal hearing. The alien has a fundamental right to participate meaningfully in the removal proceedings by having the proceedings competently translated into a language he understands. See Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827 (BIA 1994); Matter of K-L-, 20 I&N Dec. 654 (BIA 1993); Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276 (BIA 1982). In order to establish that her due process rights were violated, the respondent must prove (1) that the interpreter performed incompetently, and (2) that he was prejudiced by the errors. See Matter of Santos, supra; Matter of Exilus, supra. Incompetent testimony is shown by (1) direct evidence of incorrectly translated words, (2) unresponsive answers by a witness, and (3) a witness’s expression of difficulty understanding what was said to her. See Perez-Lastor v. INS, 208 F.3d 773 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In this case, the record reflects that the translator had to ask the Immigration Judge to repeat some of his statements (Tr. at 5-6). However, the record also reflects that the respondent said that he understood the translator (Tr. at 4), and after being given the advisals, said that he understood his rights (Tr. at 6). Consequently, we find no error.
 
The Notice to Appear alleges that, on July 19, 2013, the respondent was convicted of Theft Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii law, and sentenced to 1 year in jail. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings (Exh. 2). See section 240(c)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). Cf. United States v. Snellenberger, 548 F.3d 699, 701-02 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction and sentence (Tr. at 15-16). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). Cf. Pagayon v. Holder, 675 F.3d 1182, 1189-1190 (9th Cir. 2011); Barragan-Lopez v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir. 2007). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved (I.J. at 2). We do not find this factual finding to be clearly erroneous.
 
*3 The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony involving theft2 and a crime involving moral turpitude committed within 5 years of admission for which a sentence of 1 year or longer may be imposed (Exh. 1). The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged (I.J. at 2).
 
On appeal, the respondent also challenges removability. Specifically, he asserts that he has not been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. However, theft offenses have long been held to involve moral turpitude. See Matter of Khourn, 21 I&N Dec. 1041 (BIA 1997); Matter of Alarcon, 20 I&N Dec. 557 (BIA 1992); Matter of Esfandiary, 16 I & N Dec. 659 (BIA 1979); Matter of Chouinard, 11 I&N Dec. 839 (BIA 1966). Based on the respondent’s admissions and the evidence of the conviction in the record, we agree with the Immigration Judge that removability on both grounds has been proved by clear and convincing evidence. See section 240(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction. He says he has filed a motion to vacate his criminal conviction before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).3 While the respondent is free to pursue the motion, it does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The motion does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
We also find the respondent ineligible for relief from removal. An alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony, is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3); Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998). In addition, an alien who entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident and who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is statutorily ineligible for relief under section 212(h) of the Act. See sections 212(a), (h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), (h); Matter of Ayala, 22 I&N Dec. 398 (BIA 1998); Matter of Pineda-Castellanos, 21 I&N Dec. 1017 (BIA 1997); Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610 (BIA 1996, 1997).
 
*4 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In order for a waiver to be valid, an Immigration Judge must generally: (1) inquire specifically as to whether petitioner wishes to continue without a lawyer; and (2) receive a knowing and voluntary affirmative response. See Matter of C-B-, supra. Failure to obtain such a waiver is an effective denial of the right to counsel. See Matter of C-B-, supra.

2

The term “aggravated felony” includes a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least 1 year. See section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G). See also Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183 (2007).

3

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tony V. Blaize, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on May 25, 2005, when we dismissed as moot the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 3, 2004, decision. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removable as charged after determining that the evidence of record overcame her claim to United States citizenship. See Immigration Judge’s Decision at 1, 5. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal, however, because after unsuccessful attempts to contact the respondent by mail, we deemed the appeal to have been abandoned. On June 2, 2014, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status as the parent of a United States citizen. The motion is untimely by nearly 9 years and will be denied. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent does not claim, and it does not appear, that any exception to the filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen applies to her case. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009) (emphasizing that untimely motions to reopen to apply for adjustment of status generally do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions for motions to reopen and are generally denied); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(3). Further, we are not persuaded to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (discussing the Board’s limited authority to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte in exceptional situations).
 
Insofar as the respondent now challenges the Immigration Judge’s decision, including the finding with regard to her alleged United States citizenship, we emphasize that such issues are deemed waived as the respondent was found to have abandoned her appeal. See generally Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196, n.4 (BIA 1990) (noting that issues not addressed on appeal are deemed waived on appeal).
 
In her motion, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel against Lawrence Perlmutter, the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge.1 See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (discussing ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board), affirmed, Lozada v. I.N.S., 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She also claims that Lawrence Perlmutter represented her on appeal before the Board even though the Notice of Appeal was filed “pro se.”
 
*2 The respondent has offered evidence that in 2010, Mr. Perlmutter was charged in a Federal money-laundering case after being accused of conspiring to conceal illegal drug trafficking proceeds beginning in 2006. The respondent has not shown, however, that such activity was in any way related to Lawrence Perlmutter’s handling of her case. Further, although the respondent claims that her former attorney did not adequately prepare for her hearing because he did not secure witnesses and documentary evidence regarding her alleged United States citizenship, she has not offered any evidence with this motion in support of her citizenship claim. Further, with regard to her appeal, the respondent has not shown that the Board’s unsuccessful attempts to contact her with regard to her appeal were related to her former attorney’s handling of the appeal. Indeed, she has offered no explanation addressing why the Board’s attempts to contact her at her last address of record were unsuccessful. We are not persuaded, therefore, that Mr. Perlmutter’s allegedly deficient performance may have altered the outcome of her case. See Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (stating that to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioners must show a reasonable probability of prejudice resulting from their former representation).
 
The respondent has also not shown that she exercised due diligence in bringing her ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Bead v. Holder, 703 F.3d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 2013) (finding that the Board’s determination that an alien who sought reopening based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim had not diligently pursued his rights, as required for equitable tolling doctrine, was not abuse of discretion); Matter of Lozada, supra, 639. Although the respondent claims that she was unaware of the Board’s decision until she contacted her current attorney, she has not set forth any arguments or evidence of any attempt to contact her former attorney or this Board with regard to her appeal at any time following the filing of the Notice of Appeal on June 11, 2004.
 
In sum, we are not persuaded that equitable tolling or reopening sua sponte based on the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is warranted in this case. We acknowledge that the respondent desires to remain in the United States due to the status of her health. We emphasize, however, that we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). The respondent’s case does not present any such exceptional situation. See Matter of J-J-, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ANTHONY OLIVER CAMPBELL
File: AXXX XX6 016 - York, PA
September 22, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 8, 2014, when we denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. On July 24, 2014, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The respondent subsequently submitted additional documents. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent, however, argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance by his former counsels who represented him before the Immigration Judge, on appeal, and in his prior motion to reopen.1
 
At his hearing before the Immigration Judge, the respondent through counsel indicated that he intended to seek adjustment of status based on a marriage to a United States citizen and that his fiancée was in the process of obtaining a divorce from a previous spouse at the time. The respondent therefore requested a continuance so that the fiancée’s divorce would be finalized, they would marry, and she would file a Form I-130 visa petition for him. On May 9, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the continuance and ordered the respondent removed, after examining factors discussed in Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). Among the factors cited by the Immigration Judge was that the respondent’s application for adjustment of status would not merit a favorable exercise of discretion (I.J. at 3). Although the Immigration Judge acknowledged positive factors presented by the respondent, including the fact that his mother and fiancée are United States citizens, the Immigration Judge nevertheless found that they were outweighed by negative factors including his criminal record (I.J. at 3-5). Since the respondent did not establish that his application for adjustment of status would merit a favorable exercise of discretion, the Immigration Judge denied his motion for a continuance (I.J. at 5).
 
On appeal, the respondent through counsel challenged the denial of continuance under Matter of Hashmi, supra, and also presented evidence that the respondent and his fiancée were married and his spouse filed a visa petition for him on July 10, 2013. On September 12, 2013, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying further continuance. The Board also declined to remand the proceedings to the Immigration Judge based on the pending visa petition, because the respondent did not show that the pendency of the visa petition would likely change the result of his case.
 
*2 On March 31, 2014, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen, showing that the visa petition was approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on February 19, 2014, and requesting that the Board sua sponte reopen his proceedings to allow him to apply for adjustment of status. On April 8, 2014, as noted above, the Board denied that motion.
 
The respondent argues in the current motion that his former counsels provided ineffective assistance because they did not advise him to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). The respondent argues that he was statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal because he in fact first came to the United States in 2001 and his mother was a United States citizen. The respondent explicitly admits that he is not arguing that he would have been able to establish “““exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” for his mother upon his removal, or that his application for cancellation of removal would have been granted (Motion, at 4-5, 23-25). However, he suggests that, if he had applied for cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge would have granted him further continuance to allow him to prepare and submit an application for cancellation of removal, and this delay would have allowed him more time for his fiancée to finalize her divorce, marry the respondent, and file a visa petition for him (id.). Therefore, the respondent argues that he was prejudiced by the former counsels’ failure to advise him to apply for cancellation of removal.
 
The respondent has not shown that, if he had applied for cancellation of removal and obtained continuance, there was “reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different.” Fadiga v. U.S. Attorney General, 488 F.3d 142, 158 (3d Cir. 2007). As noted above, the respondent does not argue that there was reasonable likelihood that his application for cancellation of removal would have been granted. Rather, his argument is that his application for cancellation of removal would have afforded him a delay in his proceedings, so that his application for adjustment of status would have been decided on the merits by the Immigration Judge (Motion, at 6). However, as noted above the Immigration Judge addressed the merits of his application for adjustment of status, and found that he did not show that this application would be granted in the exercise of discretion. Also as noted above, the Board agreed with this decision on appeal. Under the circumstances of this case, the respondent has not shown “reasonable likelihood” that the outcome of his application for adjustment of status would have been different if this application were decided on the merits. Therefore, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the former counsels’ failure to advise him to apply for cancellation of removal for the purpose of delaying his proceedings.
 
*3 The respondent next argues that the former counsels provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue, in his prior motion to reopen,2 that his motion should not be governed by the standard set forth in Matter of Hashmi, supra, and rather should be governed by the standard set forth in Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996), and Matter of Pena-Diaz, 20 I&N Dec. 841 (BIA 1994). The respondent argues that, after the visa petition filed by his spouse for him was approved in February 2014, his case was no longer governed by Matter of Hashmi, supra, which is premised upon a pending visa petition rather than an approved visa petition. Instead, the respondent argues that the applicable standards are those set forth in Matter of L-O-G-, supra, and Matter of Pena-Diaz, supra, under which he is not required to conclusively show that he should be granted relief, but only required to show reasonable likelihood that relief would be granted in the exercise of discretion (Motion, at 26-30). The respondent also argues that the Board erred in the prior decision by prejudging the likelihood of the merits of his case rather than allowing the matter to be decided by the Immigration Judge (id.).
 
However, the Board’s decision in Matter of Pena-Diaz, supra, predated section 240(c)(6)-(7) of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, which set forth the legal standards applicable to motions in this case. Similarly, Matter of L-O-G-, supra, did not address the implication of timeliness or untimeliness of a motion to reopen. As noted above and in the Board’s prior decision, the respondent’s prior motion to reopen was untimely. Furthermore, his prior motion did not fall within any exception to the motion to reopen time limitations enumerated in section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The former counsels correctly requested that the Board sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) in the exercise of discretion. Therefore, the former counsels did not provide ineffective assistance, in submitting the prior motion to reopen, by failing to identify the correct legal standard. In addition, the issue of whether the respondent showed that he would merit adjustment of status as a matter of discretion was previously addressed by the Immigration Judge and the Board, as noted above.
 
Based on the above, the respondent has not shown that there was “reasonable likelihood” that the outcome of his proceedings would have been different but for the claimed ineffective assistance by his former counsels. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
*4 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

1

The respondent was represented by one attorney before the Immigration Judge and in his prior motion to reopen, and by another attorney on appeal, and these two attorneys appear to be associated with the same practice (Motion, at 2). The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims are made against both attorneys on a collective basis, thus we will address the respondent’s claims in the same manner.

2

The respondent also argues in one part of his motion that the former counsels provided ineffective assistance by failing to make this argument “on appeal” (Motion, at 2). However, at the time of the respondent’s appeal, the visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent was still pending and had not been approved. In the detailed discussion of this issue, the respondent argues that the former counsels should have made this argument in his motion to reopen (Motion, at 26-30).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ENCARNACION COJ-GARCIA
File: AXXX XX8 145 - Baltimore, MD
September 17, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Emmanuel A. Fishelman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated December 14, 2012, denying her motion to withdraw her admission of alienage and admission of removability.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case. In denying the motion, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent, through counsel, admitted and conceded she was from Guatemala (I.J. at 2).2 The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent conceded she entered the United States without inspection in her asylum application (I.J. at 2).
 
The respondent contends that she had a valid “ineffective assistance of counsel” claim, and that she did not need to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) in a pretrial motion (Resp. Br. at 11-15). The respondent cites to Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 77-79 (4th Cir. 1989) in support of her argument. In citing to Figeroa, she asserts that like the respondent in Figeroa, she did not speak English, was not educated, and was unfamiliar with the procedures by which one could file a bar complaint (Resp. Br. at 13). We reject this argument inasmuch as the respondent was represented by counsel before the Immigration Judge who could have complied with the Lozada requirements. We also reject the respondent’s argument that the lawyer was “properly” focused on the respondent’s deportation case, and not on prosecuting a civil action or bar complaint against the respondent’s former attorney (Resp. Br. at 13-14).
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contention that concessions in a motion to change venue without the respondent’s consent should not be used (Resp. Br. at 17-18). The respondent has not cited to legal authority for her argument. To the degree that the respondent asserts that her attorney made the concession of removability in the motion to change venue without her consent, this argument is without merit inasmuch as the respondent has not complied with the Lozada requirements as described above.
 
*2 We disagree with the respondent’s contention that information in the respondent’s application of relief should not be used as a concession of alienage (Resp. Br. at 18). Although the respondent cited to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(e) for this proposition, the relevant section proscribes using an application to constitute a concession of alienage only in a case in which the alien does not admit her alienage. In this case, the respondent admitted her alienage in her motion to change venue.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge did not consider whether the DHS violated 8 C.F.R. § 287.3. However, we note that the applicable DHS regulations listed under 8 C.F.R. § 287 expressly provide that they “do not, are not intended to, shall not be construed to, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter, civil or criminal.” 8 C.F.R. § 287.12; see also Navarro-Chalan v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 287.11 (1995) and the current version at 8 C.F.R. § 287.12 to explain that even if DHS regulations were applicable in the alien’s matter and were in fact violated, the regulations by its own express terms do not confer any individual rights that may be enforced in any matter). Thus, DHS regulations are not enforceable by the respondents to seek termination of proceedings or to suppress evidence. Further, even when a regulatory violation occurs, termination of proceedings or suppression of evidence is not the proper remedy. See Arias v. Rogers, 676 F.2d 1139, 1143 (7th Cir. 1982) (“To give a person who has been illegally arrested total immunity from either criminal punishment or deportation is an excessive sanction for the illegal arrest.”); cf. United States v. Guzman-Padilla, 573 F.3d 865, 890 (9th Cir. 2009) (“the government’s violation of its own rules does not provide a basis for the suppression of evidence in a criminal action”); United States v. Ani, 138 F.3d 390, 392 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Absent a constitutional violation or a congressionally created remedy, violation of an agency regulation does not require suppression of the evidence.”).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Although the Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s husband’s motion to withdraw his admission of alienage and admission of removability, the respondent’s husband did not appeal these findings.

Although the Immigration Judge did not explicitly state in the order where the admission and concession were made, they were made in the respondent’s “motion to change venue” filed in March 2011.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Danielle M. Conley, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand; continuance
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s March 13, 2014, decision, denying his request for a continuance to await the vacation of his criminal conviction which barred him from eligibility for adjustment of status. While the appeal was pending, the respondent filed a motion to remand, which the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not opposed. The motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
In support of his motion to remand, the respondent submitted a certified copy of an order from the Criminal Court, City of New York, Borough of the Bronx, dated May 13, 2014, vacating the respondent’s November 19, 2007, conviction for possession of marijuana pursuant to section 440.10(1)(h) of the New York Criminal Procedure Law (Motion to Remand, tab A). The respondent also submitted the Motion to Vacate, which was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In light of this evidence, and the lack of opposition from the DHS, the record will be remanded to allow the respondent to pursue his application for adjustment of status. See Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000) (a conviction that has been vacated pursuant to section 440 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law does not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A)).1
 
ORDER: The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Given our disposition of the respondent’s motion to remand, we need not address the respondent’s arguments on appeal challenging the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance, as those arguments are now moot.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Felipe Millan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico who was ordered removed from the United States on October 7, 2005, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated April 18, 2014, denying his motion to reopen, which he filed on April 8, 2014. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.1
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely (I.J. at 2). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent’s request for equitable tolling, a request which was not presented before the Immigration Judge, is not properly before this Board for purposes of appellate review. See Matter of Jimenez, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996). Moreover, even if such a request was properly before this Board, equitable tolling on the basis of the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel would not be warranted because he has not demonstrated due diligence. See Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990); Rashidi v. Am. President Lines, 96 F.3d 124, 128 (5th Cir. 1996); Cavazos v. Gonzales, 181 F.App’x. 453, 460 (5th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, as the respondent’s arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision, the following order is entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian Figeroux, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s decision of February 27, 2014, in which the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s first untimely motion to reopen. The respondent has also submitted additional evidence, and to that end this motion is in the style of the respondent’s second, untimely motion to reopen since the respondent’s final administrative decision of January 23, 2001. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent does not allege any specific errors of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (noting that a motion to reconsider is not a vehicle by which a party can request reopening by generally alleging error in the prior decision). The request for reconsideration is denied.
 
Insofar as the respondent reiterates his request for reopening, we are not persuaded that equitable tolling of the time and number limits on motions to reopen is warranted in this case. The time and number limits on motions may be tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel, where competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that ineffective assistance prejudiced the alien. Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882B83 (2d Cir. 1994). In addition, the alien must show due diligence in attempting to correct the error during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131-32 (2d Cir. 2008). Finally, the alien must substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent alleges ineffective assistance surrounding the filing of a visa petition after he married his United States citizen spouse on May 2, 2001, and subsequent advice regarding when to reopen his removal proceedings (Motion at 2, 4). The alleged ineffective assistance did not prejudice the respondent, as even if an I-130 petition had been filed and approved the day of his marriage any motion to reopen would still have been filed outside the 90 day period for motions to reopen. As we conclude no prejudice has been shown, we do not address the respondent’s assertion that he has established due diligence in attempting to discover and correct the alleged errors by prior counsel.
 
*2 While the Board does have the discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte, that authority is reserved for rare, “exceptional” situations not present here. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). This motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and number-barred.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION1
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lien Uy, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Juliette C. Gonsalves
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen his removal proceedings to allow him to apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(A) [extreme hardship waiver]. In our March 18, 2014, decision we dismissed his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 29, 2012, decision which found him removable and determined upon review that there was no good reason to disturb the USCIS’s denial of his application for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act [good faith marriage waiver]. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Board does not have any authority to reopen proceedings to allow the respondent to apply for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Act. We issued a final administrative decision on March 18, 2014. The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(a)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that a conditional resident who is in removal proceedings may apply for the [hardship] waiver only until such time as there is a final [administrative] removal order. It is well established that regulations promulgated by the Attorney General are binding on the Board and Immigration Judges. Matter of Akram, 25 I&N Dec. 874, 880 (BIA 2012). There is thus no basis for us to grant reopening.
 
The respondent, however, alleges ineffective assistance of (present) counsel. In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pending the outcome of a rulemaking process.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988), we set forth the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated in Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) that the court presumes, as a general rule, that the Board does not abuse its discretion when it obligates aliens to satisfy the literal requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 The respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent does not present his sworn affidavit or declaration made under penalty of perjury, and thus does not meet the first requirement in Matter of Lozada, supra. Compliance with the second requirement is excused because counsel obviously knows about the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, as they are made against him.
 
The respondent does not meet the third requirement in that he did not file a complaint against counsel with the State Bar of California, and does not offer a satisfactory explanation of why no complaint was made. Counsel states in her June 17, 2014, declaration (Motion Exh. B) that she did not know that even while the renewal of the good faith marriage waiver was before the Immigration Judge, she could have filed on the respondent’s behalf another Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) with the USCIS based on extreme hardship. While counsel states that she takes responsibility for the oversight, she does not indicate that she self-reported her alleged ineffective representation to the State Bar of California. See generally California Business and Professions Code section 6068(o) (duties of attorney).
 
When an alien retains prior counsel to pursue an argument of inadequacy of that same attorney, the reporting requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, are likely more meaningful. It is not for the attorney to decide the issues regarding her own prior conduct. The self-reporting requirement does not equate to an obvious need for discipline. The self-reporting requirement lets a state bar decide and puts the state bar on notice if there are further problems. We conclude that the respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, to allege ineffective assistance of (present) counsel. Cf Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825 (9th Cir. 2003) (the failure to file a bar complaint is not fatal to the alien’s ineffective assistance claim where former counsel submitted a letter of self-report to the state bar; this self-reporting shows that the alien’s former counsel regarded his delinquency as a serious breach of services promised to his client).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.2

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karen H. Pennington, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
Sec. 237(a)(3)(D), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(D)] - False claim of United States citizenship
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 17, 2013, sustaining the charges of removability and denying his application for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision will be affirmed. On April 23, 2013, the respondent, through his former attorney, admitted all factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear and conceded both charges of removability (Tr. at 3). Based on the respondent’s concession that he was removable pursuant to section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(D), the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not permitting him to withdraw his concession of removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act.
 
Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made during a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velazquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). In the instant case, the respondent’s admissions and concessions were formal and distinct and were made by the respondent’s former counsel in his professional capacity because they were made at a time when he was the respondent’s official attorney of record. Although the respondent asserts that he was not advised of the consequences of the concession of removability made on his behalf by his former attorney, he has not proffered any evidence to show that the concession was the result of unreasonable professional judgment or was so unfair that it has produced an unjust result.
 
*2 We are not persuaded by the respondent’s assertion that he should not be bound by the concession of his former attorney because it was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 4-7). In Mai v. Gonzalez, 473 F.3d 162, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that an attorney’s concession of removability based on a false claim of United States citizenship that cut off all available avenues of relief to the alien constituted ineffective assistance of counsel for purposes of a motion to reopen based on Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 67 (BIA 1988). However, unlike the alien in Mai, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and has not provided a persuasive reason for not doing so. Although the record reflects that the respondent’s former attorney was aware of the respondent’s allegations (Tr. at 10), the respondent has not provided an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with his former attorney or indicated whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the allegations and we are not persuaded that former counsel’s awareness of the allegations obviates the need for such evidence (Respondent’s Br. at 6). See, e.g., Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-99 (5th Cir. 2006) (upholding the need to comply with the Lozada requirements). As such, the respondent has not demonstrated that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance in conceding removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act. Because the respondent has not established that the concession was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel or other egregious circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly denied his request to withdraw his concession of removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act.
 
In sustaining the charge of removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act and denying the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, the Immigration Judge relied solely on the respondent’s concession of removability (I.J. at 2). Consequently we do not reach the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in admitting the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification submitted by the DHS (Respondent’s Br. at 7-11; Exh. 2). But see Downs v. Holder, 2014 WL. 339 77 88 (8th Cir. July 14, 2014).
 
In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. The following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick Uke, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra R. Tinkham
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen and national of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 14, 2013. The Immigration Judge denied a request for a continuance and granted voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal from the United States. Neither party appealed the grant of voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 10Q3.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record demonstrates that the Immigration Judge continued this case at the hearing on December 29, 2011, at which time the respondent was represented by an attorney, and at the hearings on January 17, 2012, January 30, 2012, and May 22, 2012, in which the respondent was acting pro se. At the hearing on May 22, 2012, the Immigration Judge gave the respondent another opportunity to complete the Form EOIR-42B he initially submitted to apply for cancellation of removal and clearly warned him that at the next hearing, if the application and any attachments were not ready, the application would be deemed abandoned or dismissed, pretermitted or denied. The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with another copy of the application for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 32).
 
At the next hearing on February 14, 2013, the respondent appeared with the above noted counsel, who requested more time to help the respondent complete the cancellation of removal form and also indicated that the respondent had informed him that he did not have a Notice to Appear (Tr. at 38-41). The respondent’s counsel indicated that the respondent initially met with the firm beginning the October prior to this hearing and that the respondent had claimed that he did not have a Notice to Appear (Tr. at 38-41). It was clarified at the hearing that the respondent acknowledged receipt of the Notice to Appear at the hearing on December 29, 2011 (Tr. at 41-42). The Immigration Judge deemed the submitted, incomplete application for cancellation of removal abandoned and also pretermitted and denied that application as incomplete. She further determined that any new application was deemed abandoned and dismissed (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 43, 45).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion and denied him due process by the Immigration Judge by pretermitting, denying, dismissing and deeming his application for cancellation of removal abandoned. Further the respondent argues that he was denied the opportunity to have meaningful representation.
 
There is no indication that the respondent was denied the opportunity to obtain representation. The record indicates that he was represented at his first and last hearings. He was also given several continuances which provided him sufficient opportunity to obtain representation. It is unclear what the respondent is claiming when he argues that he was denied the opportunity to have “meaningful representation.” To the extent that the respondent may have attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5)(ii).
 
*2 The Board does not find that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion in denying another request for a continuance at the hearing on February 14, 2013. She clearly notified the respondent at the prior hearing that she was providing him with one final opportunity to complete the Form EOIR-42B, to apply for cancellation of removal, and if, at the next hearing, the application and attachments were not ready, the application would be deemed abandoned or dismissed, pretermitted or denied (Tr. at 32). The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge if good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996); Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). The Immigration Judge provided several prior continuances for the respondent to complete his application for cancellation of removal and she did not abuse her discretion in denying yet another request for a continuance to complete such an application.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
*3 WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN RE: MIGUEL TALLEDO-GARCIA
File: AXXX XX9 652 - Las Vegas, NV

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Astrid Guzman-Ugarte, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2013, decision denying his second motion to reopen. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Peru. He was personally served with a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings, but the Notice did not specify the time and date of his hearing. On June 13, 2011, after the respondent was released from detention, a hearing notice was mailed to the address he provided upon his release, notifying him that he was scheduled for a removal hearing on February 27, 2012. That hearing notice was returned undelivered by the postal service due to “insufficient address.”
 
The respondent did not appear at his removal hearing, and the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel but failing to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge denied that motion on July 31, 2012. The respondent did not learn the motion was denied until October 2012, after the appeal period had expired. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of both of his prior counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as number-barred. That denial is the subject of this appeal.
 
An alien who is ordered removed in absentia can file only one motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge, therefore, properly denied the respondent’s second motion. This holding resolves the issue presented in this appeal.
 
Nonetheless, given the respondent’s claim of double receipt of ineffective assistance of counsel and the fact that the respondent has amply addressed the issues raised in his first motion to reopen, we will review by certification the denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c).
 
*2 First, lack of receipt of the hearing notice is not a basis for reopening and rescinding the in absentia order. The respondent had actual notice of the hearing because, he claims, his attorney’s assistant called the Immigration Court and inquired about the date and time of the hearing. The record shows, however, that the respondent did not receive the Notice of Hearing that was mailed to him. It was returned as undeliverable due to “““insufficient address.” Section 239(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2), allows service of the Notice of Hearing by regular mail. An alien is charged with receiving proper notice if the notice reaches the correct address but does not reach the alien. Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001).
 
In this case, the record suggests the respondent bears responsibility for the Notice of Hearing being undeliverable. The Form I-830 indicates that the address reported by the respondent upon his release from detention did not include his apartment number (Exh. 2). A subsequent change of address form the respondent submitted indicates he moved from apartment 131 to apartment 173 at the address to which the Notice of Hearing was mailed. It, thus, appears likely that the respondent’s apparent failure to provide his apartment number is the reason the hearing notice was undeliverable due to “insufficient address.” Because the Notice of Hearing was properly mailed to the respondent’s address on file, the respondent’s failure to receive it does not provide an adequate basis for reopening and rescinding the in absentia removal order.
 
Second, the respondent did not sufficiently establish ineffective assistance of counsel. To warrant reopening based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien should (1) submit an affidavit describing the alleged misconduct and detailing the agreement for representation, (2) provide former counsel with an opportunity to respond to the allegations, (3) indicate whether a bar complaint has been filed, and (4) demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40. Neither of the respondent’s motions to reopen satisfied the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada
 
The failure to fully comply with the Lozada requirements will not bar consideration of the motion where ineffective assistance of counsel is clear from the record. Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that ineffectiveness was clear on the face of the record where counsel failed to file application for relief). In this case, however, ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent from the record.
 
*3 The respondent claims that he did not attend his removal hearing because he was told his counsel would attend and his presence was not needed. As the Immigration Judge observed, no counsel entered an appearance in the proceedings, and the respondent did not sufficiently establish that he had obtained counsel. The declaration submitted with his second motion to reopen asserts that he signed a contract with counsel for representation before the Immigration Court, but the respondent has not provided a copy of any such agreement nor asserted that he is unable to provide a copy (second motion to reopen at Tab HI). He does not describe any particular details of the agreement, other than that it was for representation before the Immigration Court. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should include “a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken”).
 
The respondent provided two receipts as evidence of his retention of counsel for the proceedings (second motion to reopen at Tab I). The receipts state that they are for attorney’s fees, but do not identify the payee. Thus, they are not strong evidence that the respondent retained counsel as he claims. There is also a discrepancy between the receipts - one for $850 dated February 16, 2012, and one for $150 dated February 25, 2012 - and the respondent’s assertion in his bar complaint that he paid $1,000 on the day he signed the contract with counsel (see second motion to reopen at Tab V).
 
For these reasons, the respondent did not meet his burden of showing he had an agreement with counsel to represent him at the February 27, 2012, removal hearing.
 
Additionally, the respondent did not give his first attorney an opportunity to respond to his claim of ineffective assistance as required by Matter of Lozada. Because it is not apparent from the record that the first attorney was actually retained by the respondent, providing counsel an opportunity to respond to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance is an important part of his burden of showing that reopening is warranted. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (“the potential for abuse is apparent where no mechanism exists for allowing former counsel, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, to present his version of events if he so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations”); accord Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2003) (describing importance of Lozada’s requirement that former counsel be notified of allegations and given opportunity to respond). The respondent’s assertion that he tried to confront the attorney at his office but was instead “received by the attorney’s assistant” did not provide the attorney a meaningful opportunity to respond to the respondent’s claims (respondent’s brief at unnumbered page 7).
 
*4 In these two ways, the respondent did not satisfy his burden under Matter of Lozada to show deficient performance by counsel.1 Having not shown ineffective assistance of counsel or a deficiency in the Notice of Hearing, the respondent has not shown error in the denial of his first motion to reopen.
 
For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Given the lack of showing of deficiency in the performance of the respondent’s first counsel, no prejudice results from any deficient performance by the respondent’s second counsel, whose firm concedes they did not provide the respondent notice of the denial of his first motion to reopen.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Olivieri Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James E. Manning
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the May 22, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen the proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The basic facts of this case are not in dispute. The respondent adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident on September 29, 1989, and on September 22, 2004, he was convicted in Texas of possession of cocaine. A Notice to Appear was issued the next day and, on December 12, 2004, he was ordered removed under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated felony) and 237(a)(2)(B)(i) (controlled substance violation) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i). The respondent appealed this decision to the Board, but withdrew his appeal on February 3, 2005, and he departed the United States.
 
In 2006, the Supreme Court issued a decision holding that convictions such as the respondent’s were not aggravated felonies. See Lopez v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 47 (2006) (holding that a first-time conviction for simple possession of drugs that is neither an illicit trafficking offense nor a federal felony does not constitute an aggravated felony for immigration purposes). On April 11, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied on May 22, 2014. The Immigration Judge found that the motion was untimely and declined to reopen the proceedings sua sponte (I.J. at 2-3). The Immigration Judge further observed that, although the respondent appears to be claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, this is not grounds for equitable tolling or reopening the proceedings at this late date. We agree.
 
The respondent’s request for reopening was untimely under the general rule requiring aliens to file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent also failed to demonstrate that any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the time limitation on motions to reopen apply to his case. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(i)-(iv). The motion was properly denied as untimely.
 
*2 Further, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), the respondent’s departure from the United States while under a final order of removal barred consideration of the motion before the Immigration Judge sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (“A motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal ... proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.”); Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 296 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that the Board acted reasonably in concluding that we lacked sua sponte regulatory authority to reopen the proceedings based on a change in intervening law, pursuant to our comparable departure bar provision at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d)); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir. 2003) (holding that the Board’s interpretation of our authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings based on an intervening change in law as being subject to the requirement that the alien had not been deported was a reasonable interpretation of applicable regulations).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s arguments on appeal (Resp. Br. at 8-10), we do not construe Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257 (5th Cir. 2012), to allow consideration of the instant motion sua sponte. In that case, the Fifth Circuit addressed the interplay between the Immigration Courts’ departure-bar provision at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), our own comparable departure bar provision under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), and the statutory right to file a motion to reopen under the Act. Garcia-Carias, supra, at 261-65. In finding those regulations invalid as applied to statutory motions to reopen, the court expressly refused to address the alien’s arguments regarding the timeliness of his motion to reopen. Id. at 260-261 & n.1. In Garcia-Carias, supra, the Court also expressly distinguished the case before it from Navarro-Miranda, supra, and Ovalles, supra, which resolved the issue of the applicability of the departure bar to the regulatory authority to reopen cases sua sponte. Id. at 265. Under these decisions, the Immigration Judge lacked regulatory authority to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See Navarro-Miranda, supra; Ovalles, supra.
 
*3 Here, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on timeliness grounds and sua sponte due to the respondent’s departure from the United States (I.J. at 2-3). To the extent the respondent relies on any claimed ineffective assistance of counsel and equitable tolling principles, under Fifth Circuit precedent, an argument for equitable tolling of the time limitation on motions is construed as a challenge to our refusal to exercise our regulatory power to reopen the proceedings sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008). The Immigration Judge properly found he was unable to reopen the proceedings sua sponte.
 
We also find no miscarriage of justice. Regardless of any change in law pertaining to the classification of the respondent’s conviction as an aggravated felony, the respondent was still removable for being convicted of an offense related to a controlled substance. See section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. The respondent’s final administrative removal order was lawfully executed upon his departure from the United States. Further, at the time of his proceedings, the law of the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did support removal on all grounds. Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: OSCAR ANTONIO GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX1 147 - Newark, NJ
August 18, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rafael Figueroa, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Review of denial of Temporary Protected Status
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated February 27, 2013, finding him ineligible for temporary protected status (“TPS”) and ordering him removed to El Salvador. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). In that the respondent filed his application after May 11, 2005, these proceedings are subject to the REAL ID Act. Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42 (BIA 2006).
 
An applicant for TPS may seek de novo review by an Immigration Judge in removal proceedings. See Matter of Ismael Lopez-Aldana, 25 I&N Dec. 49 (BIA 2009); see also Matter of Barrientos, 24 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 2007). The initial period for registration for TPS for Salvadoran nationals was from March 9, 2001 to September 9, 2002. See 66 Fed. Reg. 14214 (Mar. 9, 2001). The respondent submitted an application for TPS on May 10, 2001, during the initial registration period. However, the respondent’s application was rejected by the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service on September 6, 2001, for insufficient funds and a rejection notice was sent to the respondent at his home address of record (Exh. 2 at illegible page number).
 
The respondent next filed an application for TPS on September 14, 2006. On December 13, 2006, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) informed the respondent that his application would be denied because he did not establish that he was eligible for the late registration provisions of the TPS regulations.1 The application was denied on May 29, 2007.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is ineligible for TPS (I.J. at 3-4). Although he filed an application during the initial registration period for El Salvador, the application was denied. The respondent alleges that he did not receive a notice that the check provided for the filing fee bounced, which also provided a limited opportunity to present the correct fee. Although the record does not contain a copy of the original notice, or the return of that notice, a second notice advising the respondent that his application was rejected for failure to pay the fee is contained in the record (Exh. 2 at illegible page number). The notice was sent to the respondent’s address of record. Id. The respondent also claims that he filed a subsequent application during the initial registration period, but there is no evidence of this filing in the administrative record. Therefore, the respondent did not establish that he had a TPS application pending when the initial registration period ended on September 9, 2002.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent reasserts his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, based on a notary’s handling of his TPS application (Respondent’s Brief at 7-8). However, even if we consider the respondent’s claim that there was the equivalent of ineffective assistance of counsel in the notary’s actions, the claim fails because the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements.2 See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring alien to set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel; that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and that the alien indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not).
 
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has rejected a strict compliance rule regarding the third prong of Lozada, i.e., filing a bar complaint. See Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127 (3d Cir. 2001); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 559 (BIA 2003) (the Board will apply the applicable circuit court law in each respected circuit regarding Lozada strict compliance). Since the respondent asserts that it was not an attorney, but a notary who gave him erroneous advice, he cannot comply with the third prong of Lozada, i.e., filing a bar complaint. However, he can comply with the equivalent of the first and second prongs, and has not done so. The respondent has not set forth in any detail the agreement that was entered into with the notary, and although he testified that he does not remember the notary’s name, it is listed on his original application for TPS, of which there is a photocopy in the record (Exh. A at 22-25; Tr. at 47-48; Respondent’s Brief at 1-2). Thus, he has not substantially complied with the Lozada requirements (I.J. at 5). See e.g., Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2008); Bardales-Montes v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., No. 09-4703, 2011 WL 1370564 (3d Cir. Apr. 6, 2011) (unpublished).
 
Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that even if the respondent were able to establish that he substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, he has not shown that the principle of equitable tolling is warranted in this matter, as he has failed to establish that he exercised due diligence “over the entire period for which tolling is desired” (I.J. at 4-5). Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008)).
 
*3 Inasmuch as the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent is ineligible for TPS and ordered him removed to El Salvador, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

An alien may also register for temporary protected status during a subsequent extension of his country’s designation if he falls within any of the four exceptions which allow for this late registration. See section 244(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(f); 8 C.F.R. § 244.2(f).

This would also be assuming the respondent could pursue his ineffective assistance claim in these proceedings, even though it relates to conduct which was not part of the removal proceedings. See Contreras v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 665 F.3d 578 (3d Cir. 2012); see also Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1050-51 (9th Cir. 2008).
