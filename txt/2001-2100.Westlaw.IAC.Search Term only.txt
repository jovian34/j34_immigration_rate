MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martha E. Garza, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Allen Reid Tilson,
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 Now before the Board of Immigration Appeals is the respondent’s motion filed with us on September 29, 2004. We will address the motion, which is captioned as a motion to reconsider, as for both reconsideration and reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
This case was before the Board last on August 30, 2004, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen filed with us on May 19, 2004. In our prior decision dated February 26, 2004, we summarily affirmed an Immigration Judge’s November 1, 2002, decision, which found the respondent removable; denied his applications for waivers of inadmissibility under sections 212(c) and 212(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(c) and 1182(i); denied his motion for a continuance and his motion to withdraw an admission of an allegation concerning his false claim to United States citizenship; and ordered him removed from the United States to Vietnam.
 
With respect to reconsideration, we find that this motion must be denied because the respondent has not demonstrated any error in our decision of August 30, 2004, on the record then before us, upon consideration of the contentions in the motion. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). In our August 2004 decision, we made the following determinations. The respondent did not establish prejudice by his former attorney, with regard to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also did not establish eligibility for a section 212(c) waiver or cancellation of removal, and he could not couple both to waive his inadmissibility.
 
With respect to reopening, we find that this motion must be denied because it is an impermissible multiple motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2004) (limiting motions to reopen to a single such motion, whether filed before the Board or the Immigration Judge). As we already have stated, we denied the respondenT’s previous motion to reopen in our decision of August 30, 2004. We also find that the respondent has not demonstrated eligibility for any of the regulatory exceptions to the time and number restrictions on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3) (2004). In addition, we do not find that sua sponte reopening is warranted for any reason. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999).
 
Even if we were to reach the merits of the present motion to reopen, we would deny it, based on the following rationale. The respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the newly requested relief. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139 (1981) (per curiam). Consistent with the DHS’s position in its opposition memorandum, the respondent, who is already a lawful permanent resident, does not qualify to apply for adjustment of status in conjunction with a waiver under section 209(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1159. Cf. Matter of K-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 661 (BIA 2004) (confirming an Immigration Judge’s jurisdiction to adjudicate an asylee’s application for adjustment of status in conjunction with a waiver under section 209(c)).
 
*2 Accordingly, we will deny the motion to consider and reopen.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied, and the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luis Carlos Ayala, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before Board on April 23, 2004, when we concluded that the respondents’ decision to waive appeal was knowingly and intelligently made, and thus, the Board did not have jurisdiction to consider their appeal.1 The respondents have filed a timely motion to reconsider and reopen to present new evidence regarding their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not filed a response to the motion. The motion will be denied.2
 
In our prior decision, the Board concluded that the respondents’ decision to waive appeal was knowingly and intelligently made. Moreover, the prior decision addressed the respondents attempt to present an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In this regard, it was first determined that the respondent had not complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and that the record before the Board did not establish that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondents, through new counsel, assert in their motion that the Board erred in requiring them to comply with the requirements set forth in with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, since the attorney who represented them before the Immigration Judge was not licensed to practice law. The respondents, for the first time, have submitted evidence that their prior attorney had resigned on September 15, 1996, from the State Bar of California. The respondents asserts that they were not given a full and fair hearing and were prejudiced by the lack of preparation of former counsel. In this regard, the respondents, relying upon the advice of the attorney, requested voluntary departure prior to the conclusion of proceedings which then precluded them from any relief.
 
In considering this issue, we note that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such.3 See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth Circuit has also held that if an alien is ineffectively represented by a non-lawyer who purports to be a licensed attorney, the alien is not barred from proving an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999); Varela v. INS, supra. Further, the alien must show that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Id.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondents have pointed to their prior representatives advice to seek and accept a grant of voluntary departure prior to the conclusion of their proceedings as provided under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), as evidence of ineffective assistance. However, based upon the record before the Board, voluntary departure was and is the only form of relief from removal available to the respondents. The respondents do not qualify for cancellation of removal as provided by section 240A(b) of the Act since they do not have the requisite physical presence prior to service of the Notice to Appear. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act. The respondents have not indicated a fear of returning to Mexico pursuant to the provisions of section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, or presented that they are eligible for any other forms of relief from removal. Thus, since voluntary departure was the only form of relief the respondents were eligible to pursue before the Immigration Judge, their representative’s advice to pursue voluntary departure was proper.
 
In sum, although the respondents were represented by someone who was not licensed to practice law at the time he represented them before the Immigration Judge, his representation of the respondents was not ineffective as to affect the outcome. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

A separate decision has been issued relating to the respondents’ husband/father (Aurelian Legis-Alvarez, A92 810 793).

2

The respondents indicate in their motion that the Immigration Judge failed to make a determination regarding an apparent request to withdraw representation made by the former attorney. However, the transcript reveals that, upon the former attorney’s indication that he may need to withdraw his representation, the Immigration Judge directed the attorney to consult and follow the procedures set forth in the court’s local rules (Tr. at 9-10). It appears that the former attorney never filed a motion to withdraw with the court.

3

In Lozada, supra, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.

Tracy J. Cody,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen and remand proceedings for consideration of an application for cancellation of removal. The Board will reopen these removal proceedings on our motion, and the record will be remanded so that the respondent can apply for cancellation of removal.
 
In a decision dated October 2, 2002, the respondent was found removable as charged, and to have abandoned any potential applications for relief, and was ordered removed from the United States. The decision was issued after a hearing held in absentia due to the respondent’s failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A).
 
On October 22, 2002, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. The motion was denied on December 5, 2002. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had proper notice of his hearing, and did not establish that exceptional circumstances existed which should excuse his failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. The respondent appealed to the Board. The appeal was dismissed on November 19, 2003.
 
On February 5, 2004, the respondent filed the motion to reopen which is pending. The respondent wants the record reopened and remanded, due to exceptional circumstances based on ineffective assistance of counsel, so that his application for cancellation of removal can be considered. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted a reply brief, stating its non-opposition to the respondent’s motion.
 
As previously indicated, we will reopen the respondent’s proceedings sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). This eliminates any concern that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. Accordingly, we will reopen the proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge dated July 16, 2003, denying the respondent’s application for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), and ordering him removed to the United Kingdom. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
Although the respondent indicated in his Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-27) that he would submit a separate brief on appeal, he has failed to do so. Thus, we are limited to the arguments raised on appeal.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his removal hearing because his prior attorney did not submit documents within the Immigration Court’s guidelines. However, the respondent has failed to establish what documents he would have submitted and how the consideration of these documents would have warranted a grant of his application for voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge properly relied on the respondent’s immigration history and criminal record in the United States to deny the respondent’s application for voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b); Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Cordova, 22 I&N Dec. 966 (BIA 1999).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for cancellation of removal and granted the respondent voluntary departure on July 24, 2003. On February 10, 2004, the Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of that decision. Currently, the respondent requests that his case be reopened and remanded in light of new evidence that he claims establishes that exceptional and extremely unusual hardship would befall his lawful permanent resident parents upon his removal and further claims that his case should be reopened because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion.
 
We will first review the portion of the respondent’s motion that is based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. We note that the respondent’s argument rests upon two alleged failures of his prior attorney. As each count stems from independent and separate aspects of the respondent’s claim, we will review each count in turn.
 
A motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An alien must also show that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case and that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Id. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction under which this case arises, has found, however, that aliens need not strictly adhere to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, especially when there is a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.”1 See, e.g., Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
*2 First, the respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance when his prior attorney failed to timely submit evidence concerning his daughter’s physical health. The respondent argues that this failure resulted in prejudice because the Immigration Judge’s denial was based in part upon the fact that the “Court could not determine how serious the condition is, and nothing in the record suggests that the respondent’s daughter could not get the necessary medications in Mexico for her condition.” (I.J. at 6). Although the respondent is correct in that his prior attorney failed to submit this highly relevant evidence, he has nonetheless failed to establish prejudice because the documents his attorney failed to submit did not remedy the Immigration Court’s concerns, that were affirmed by this Board, regarding the lack of evidence proving that his daughter would not receive medication in Mexico. Accordingly, we cannot find that the respondent received ineffective assistance under these facts.
 
The respondent additionally argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance when he failed to submit evidence to the Board, while his appeal was pending, pertaining to his parents’ recent change in status to lawful permanent residents. He argues that his parents are now qualifying relatives that he can establish exceptional and extremely exceptional hardship through. Again, the respondent must prove that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s performance. Matter of Lozada, surpa. Inasmuch as the respondent’s current attorney was able to timely file a motion to reopen before the Board containing the evidence the respondent would like considered, we cannot find that the respondent was prejudiced.
 
Finally, the respondent was granted voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). If an alien fails to voluntarily depart in the time period specified in the order, the alien will be subject to the civil penalties provided in section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). See Shaar v. INS, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998); Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541, 544-46 (BIA 1996). These penalties include becoming ineligible for relief under section 240A for a period of 10 years. We note that the respondent was provided adequate notice of these penalties in our March 10, 2004, decision. 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b) (requiring notice to alien of penalties in order). The respondent has failed to submit evidence establishing that an extension was requested and granted by the district director. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f) (2002) (providing that the authority to extend a voluntary departure period “is within the sole jurisdiction of the district director”). Without evidence of an extension, we must find that the respondent is not prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act. Given our finding in this regard, we do not find it appropriate to reopen and remand proceedings based upon the respondent’s request for a hearing on the merits of his application for cancellation of removal.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, we will deny the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

We note that the respondent’s motion to reopen states that he provided his prior attorney notice of the allegations against him and that a copy of such notice was provided with the motion. Upon review of the motion, we note that the respondent has failed to include this evidence. However, considering that the Ninth Circuit does not require strict adherence, but rather substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, we will consider the merits of the respondent’s motion. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding compliance where alien provided affidavit explaining agreement and filed a complaint).

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This record was last before us on November 6, 2003, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the decision of an Immigration Judge, dated May 25, 2000, which denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). We summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E), because the respondent had indicated his intention to file a separate written brief or statement in support of his appeal, but failed to do so within the time set for filing. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen his proceedings, asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his proceedings before the Immigration Court and on appeal.
 
Subsequently, by motion filed on October 7, 2004, the respondent has informed this Board that, on October 4, 2004, the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, granted the respondent’s petition for writ of habeas corpus and determined that the respondent should be allowed to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. The respondent requests that these proceedings be reopened and remanded to the Immigration Court for further consideration of his eligibility, for relief. The motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings to consider the respondent’s eligibility for cancellation of removal.

*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Arrived at a time or place not designated by the Attorney General (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
An Immigration Judge found the respondents removable as charged and denied their application for cancellation of removal, but granted their request for voluntary departure under sections 240A(b), and 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(a), and 1229c. On appeal the respondents argue that the Immigration Judge erred in finding they had failed to demonstrate the requisite hardship for cancellation of removal. The respondents have also filed a motion to remand the record based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing below. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
Section 240A(b) of the Act provides that the Attorney General may cancel the removal of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable if the alien:
(A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application;
 
(B) has been a person of good moral character during such period;
 
(C) has not been convicted of an offense under section 212(a)(2), 237(a)(2), or 237(a)(3); and
 
(D) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien’s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
 
Section 240A(b) of the Act.
 
The respondents have three United States citizen children, born in 1990, 1995, and 1997. The lead respondent testified that they were all three in good health and were doing well in school (Tr. at 95-97). At the time of the hearing the lead respondent was receiving worker’s compensation for an injury and his spouse, the second respondent, was employed. Reviewing both the evidence presented to the Immigration Judge and, as discussed below, the evidence submitted with the motion to remand, we agree that the respondents have failed to demonstrate that their removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their children. As we have held, this standard is substantially beyond that which would ordinarily be expected to result from removal. The respondents have not demonstrated this level of hardship. Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001); see also Matter of Recinas, 23 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 2002).
 
*2 In the motion to remand, the respondents argue that their previous attorney did not properly present the evidence in their case. They allege that the attorney should have submitted information regarding the lead respondent’s health, evidence of the children’s difficulty in school, and the respondent’s tax returns. With the motion, the respondents have submitted a letter from a doctor indicating that the respondent is recovering from back surgery and his activities are currently limited. They have also submitted school letters indicating that their Mexican born child and the oldest United States citizen child are in special education classes. They have not submitted any additional tax documentation.
 
We set forth the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition to other requirements, it is incumbent on the claimant to establish that he or she suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. To satisfy the requirements of due process of law, an alien must be provided a fair hearing. United States v. Torres-Sanchez, 68 F.3d 227 (8th Cir. 1995); Gandarillas-Zambrana v. BIA, 44 F.3d 1251 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 7 F.3d 1483 (10th Cir. 1993); Michelson v. INS, 897 F.2d 465 (10th Cir. 1990); Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1979); Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827 (BIA 1994); Matter of Tomas, 19 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1987); Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276 (BIA 1982). In order to show denial of a fair hearing, an alien must demonstrate that he or she has suffered prejudice. United States v. Torres-Sanchez, supra; Gandarillas-Zambrana v. BIA, supra; Michelson v. INS, supra; United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, supra; Nicholas v. INS, supra; Matter of D-, supra; Matter of Exilus, supra. Considering the evidence below and the minimal documentation submitted with the motion, we find that the United States citizen children would not face hardship that rises to the level of exceptional and extremely unusual. Accordingly, the motion will be denied, the decision of the Immigration Judge affirmed and the appeal dismissed.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the decision of the Immigration Judge affirmed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event a respondent fails to so depart, that respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If a respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, that respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pignone III, Marco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ira L. Mazer,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 30, 2003. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge improperly entered an order of removal instead of continuing proceedings to allow her to file a Form I-751 (petition to remove conditions on permanent residence). The respondent also moves the Board to remand proceedings for consideration of the I-751, as well as her application for adjustment of status based on her marriage to Yun Guang Zhang, who was granted adjustment of status under the Chinese Student Protection Act on November 22, 2002. See Motion to Remand, Exh. 1; see also Respondent’s Brief at Exh. B. The respondent correctly points out that as a spouse of one who has been granted status under the CSPA, she is presumptively eligible for adjustment of status. In her motion, the respondent argues that her former counsel was ineffective in failing to file the I-751 within the time frame set by the Immigration Judge; this prevented her from defending herself against charges of a fraudulent first marriage and from timely filing her I-751 and application for adjustment, both based upon her current marriage to Mr. Zhang. The respondent provided an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with prior counsel. See Motion to Remand at Exh. 3. The respondent also indicates in her motion that she has notified prior counsel of her grievance and that she has filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Office of Disciplinary Counsel. See Respondent’s Motion to Remand; Supplement to Motion to Remand. Accordingly, we find that the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). To advance a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate prejudice, i.e., she “must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting ¿herº case.” Uspango v. Ashcroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3d Cir. 2002). Because it appears that prior counsel’s actions prevented the respondent from defending against the allegations of marriage fraud, and prevented her from presenting her application for adjustment of status, we will remand this matter for consideration of the respondent’s Form I-751 and her application for adjustment of status. Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

File: AXX XX3 162 - Los Angeles
October 28, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 25, 2004, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. She has filed a timely motion to reconsider that denial. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
In a decision dated March 11, 2004, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen her removal proceedings after entry of an in absentia order of removal. On June 9, 2004, the respondent, acting pro se, filed with the Board a motion to reopen based upon the ineffective assistance of her former counsel. We denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for failure to substantiate her claim with any evidentiary materials.
 
On July 22, 2004, the respondent filed this motion to reconsider, claiming that the Board failed to address the fact that she had indicated that she would be supplementing her motion to reopen with materials in support of her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, the respondent claims that she has now satisfied those requirements. With her motion to reconsider, she has submitted a declaration setting forth the agreement she entered into with her former counsel, a copy of a bar complaint filed with the State Bar of California regarding her former counsel’s conduct, and a copy of a cover letter which accompanied a copy of the State Bar complaint informing her former counsel of the allegations.
 
A motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Board’s previous decision, an error was made. It is a “request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, at 402 n.2 (BIA 1991) (quoting Hurwitz, Motions Practice Before the Board of Immigration Appeals, 20 San Diego L. Rev. 79, 90 (1992)). The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard. Id. at 402. The regulations require that a motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, and shall be supported by pertinent authority. 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(b)(1) (2004).
 
We find no error in our previous decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. Although we did not explicitly acknowledge the respondent’s assertion that she was in the process of supplementing her motion with documentation in support of her ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we find that consideration of this factor does not change our original analysis or ultimate conclusion. A motion to reopen must be accompanied by the requisite supporting evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion which merely states that evidence that might support reopening will be provided does not provide an adequate basis for the reopening of proceedings. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen, at the time it was filed, did not meet the regulatory or substantive requirements for a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Finally, we note the respondent’s argument that pursuant to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision in Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2000). the period for filing her motion to reopen should be tolled because of the alleged negligence of her formal counsel. In Fajardo, the court held that the limitations period on motions to reopen based upon exceptional circumstances can be equitably tolled until the alien becomes aware of the harm resulting from the attorney’s misconduct. In the instant matter, however, the respondent has met the regulatory time limitation for a motion to reopen. In addition, according to the respondent’s motion to reopen, she was aware of former counsel’s alleged negligence at the time of the filing of the motion to reopen. We do not find that the Court’s decision in Fajardo v. INS, supra, compels the equitable tolling of the substantive requirements of a motion to reopen.
 
Therefore, we decline to reconsider our denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen, as we find no error in our decision as based upon the record before the Board at that time. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
E. Dennis Muchnicki, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on November 19, 2003. On September 7, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue our previous decision.
 
The respondent alleges that his former attorney failed to inform him of our earlier decision, so that he could file a petition for review with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We find that the respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, and we will treat the motion as unopposed. The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003) (Board has authority to reissue decision). The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 19, 2003, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On August 20, 2004, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal because he had waived the right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The respondent filed a motion to reconsider this decision on September 17, 2004. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that the decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and intelligent one. Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). He claims that an attorney, Rita Mahdessian, represented him, but sent another attorney in her stead for the March 11, 2004, removal hearing. This attorney, Seth Reszko, agreed to a lengthy period of voluntary departure under 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), for which the right to appeal must be waived. Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (grant of voluntary departure prior to completion of removal proceeding, under section 240B(a) of the Act, requires an express waiver of the right to appeal).
 
The respondent argues that attorney Mahdessian had agreed to seek a continuance of proceedings, with an appeal filed if such was denied, in order to “keep his case alive” pending the resolution of an employment visa filed on his behalf. Reszko, according to the respondent, failed to explain why he was seeking voluntary departure, and declined to represent the respondent unless there would be no appeal.
 
The respondent has filed a complaint against attorney Mahdessian. However, the alleged actions about which he complains were taken by attorney Reszko. Therefore, the respondent has failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, those cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). Reszko has not been informed of the charges, so his version of events has not been sought. This is particularly significant, where the pursuit of a lengthy voluntary departure period appears to have been a reasonable strategic action on the part of counsel in this case. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998). Where the respondent claims that he did not agree to, or understand, this strategy, attorney Reszko should have been provided the chance to refute the respondent’s assertions.
 
*2 The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

APPLICATION: Reconsider; reopen; remand.
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Kenya. This case was last before us on June 30, 2004, when we denied the respondent’s previous motion to reopen proceedings. Subsequent to the date on which we issued our decision, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and a second motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent’s second motion to reopen is number barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (parties are limited to one motion to reopen). We further note that the Immigration Judge granted the respondent 120 days in which to voluntarily depart. The respondent has presented no evidence showing that she received an extension of that period from the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). The record shows that she was provided oral and written notice of the consequences for failing to voluntarily depart within the time allowed. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reconsider and motion to reopen must be denied, because the respondent has remained in the United States beyond the expiration of her voluntary departure period. See Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), aff’d, Shaar v. INS, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
With regard to the respondent’s motion to reconsider, we note that, in addition to our denial of such motion based on the respondent’s failure to voluntarily depart, the motion is otherwise deniable as it fails to establish error in our prior decision. As we indicated in our June 30, 2004, decision, the respondent was not eligible for relief from removal at the time that we issued such decision. Specifically, the respondent indicates that her husband became a United States citizen in January of 2004. However, the respondent’s period of voluntary departure expired on July 15, 2003. Thus, the respondent would not have been eligible to adjust her status after that date, as she remained in the United States beyond the expiration of her voluntary departure period. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(a). Hence, the respondent has failed to establish error in our prior decision, and she has failed to establish that her prior attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to apply for a form of relief from which she was barred. See Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954-55 (9th Cir 2003) (finding that the applicant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, as he failed to demonstrate either deficient performance or the required prejudice).
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider and motion to reopen are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lila Alcarez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Phillip Hatfield
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen with the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”). Therein, he presented additional evidence in support of his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The motion is denied.
 
We have also considered the respondent’s argument that she was ineffectively represented by her former attorney in these proceedings. According to the respondent, her former counsel failed to present evidence to prove that her United States citizen children would suffer exceptionally and extremely unusual hardship if forced to return with the respondent to Mexico.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In addition, we have considered that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). However, the Ninth Circuit stated that “the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and under ordinary circumstances the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 525.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent indicated that her former attorney failed to inform the Immigration Judge that her United States citizen child suffers from cognitive problems potentially caused by a 1996 automobile accident. Submitted was a 2004 report from a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, medical and educational records, and the respondent’s affidavit. The Board need not resolve whether the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel because we cannot find that the respondent established that she was prejudiced. Although we do not dispute that the respondent’s child’s health condition should have been disclosed to the Immigration Judge, we note no evidence that the respondent’s child will be unable to obtain the medical and educational services that he may require in Mexico. The clinical social worker makes a general assertion in her report that the respondent’s son will be unable to receive special education in Mexico, but no evidence in support of that conclusion was provided. It is also unclear from the report whether the respondent’s child will be approved by the school system for special education. The clinical social worker recommends that the child receive therapy in the school district, but it is unclear whether the respondent’s child was approved for such. Based upon the evidence provided, we cannot conclude that the respondent was prejudiced in these proceedings, or is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal if the proceedings were remanded.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated August 27, 2002. The respondent asserts that his former representative, James Robert Valinoti, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in prior proceedings before the Immigration Judge. Specifically, he asserts that former counsel motioned to withdraw his application for cancellation of removal in error. Moreover, he asserts that additional evidence demonstrates that he accumulated the requisite period of continuous physical presence to apply for cancellation of removal.
 
Upon review, we note that James R. Valinoti was suspended from practice before this Board for three years beginning on July 24, 2003. In addition, new documents submitted with the motion to reopen demonstrate the respondent’s general compliance with the requirements we detailed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (laying out the requirements for a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). We find that the record is unclear with regard to the respondent’s actual period of residence in the United States prior to the issuance of the Notice to Appear. We will thus remand this matter to the Immigration Judge for further review.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack Sachs, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF SERVICE:
 
Lauren T. Farber
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Waiver pursuant to section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the May 27, 2003, decision of the Immigration Judge ordering his removal to the Dominican Republic based on the charges set out in his Notice to Appear (Form I-862) (“NTA”). The respondent had wished to apply for relief pursuant to section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but the application was pretermitted by the Immigration Judge. We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Through counsel, the respondent admitted the factual allegations contained in the NTA and conceded removability (Tr. at 7). The respondent’s attorney also conceded that no relief was available to the respondent (Tr. at 8). When a respondent admits factual allegations and concedes removability, and the Immigration Judge is satisfied that no errors of fact or law remain, the Immigration Judge may properly determine that removability has been established based on the respondent’s admissions and concessions. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c).
 
In addition, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent is ineligible for relief from removal. As a lawful permanent resident convicted of an aggravated felony after April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, the respondent is ineligible for any form of discretionary relief from removal. As the respondent has expressed no fear of persecution or torture upon return to the Dominican Republic, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent also did not have a valid claim for any form of non-discretionary relief from removal.
 
The respondent states on appeal that the file should be remanded because his conviction print-out was not a certified copy. A review of the record, however, indicates that the criminal conviction information was certified by the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut (Exh. 2). The respondent also claims on appeal that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, stating that his attorney appeared to have little or no knowledge of the case or immigration law terminology.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such claims require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
*2 It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 3367 (BIA 1998). Ineffective assistance of counsel only amounts to a denial of due process if the proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case and that he was prejudiced by the attorney’s performance. See Lozada, supra, at 638. This respondent was not prevented from presenting his claims. The proceedings were not fundamentally unfair.
 
The respondent’s present attorney did not comply with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent would not have succeeded in obtaining relief from removal, even if his attorney had acted differently. His status as aggravated felon does not change. Different counsel more experienced in immigration proceedings would not have been able to change the outcome in these proceedings. The respondent was thus not prejudiced by his counsel’s actions. The result arrived at by the Immigration Judge is correct. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on June 30, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s October 7, 2003, decision denying his motion to reopen his proceedings and rescind the order of removal entered against him in absentia on May 5, 2003. The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider our June 30, 2004, decision and a motion to reopen his proceedings in order to apply for adjustment of status.
 
Through his motion to reconsider, the respondent claims that the Board erred in dismissing his appeal and in failing to find that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BLA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such claims require: (1) that the claim be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
In the instant case, the respondent has admittedly not submitted an affidavit or filed a complaint with the bar association against his former attorneys. The respondent has also failed to articulate how his former attorneys failed to represent him. In fact, contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the record reflects that, although his former attorneys formally withdrew their representation of the respondent, they actually came to the respondent’s hearing in May 2003, to discuss the situation with the Immigration Judge. Unfortunately, the respondent himself was not present at the hearing. As a result, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was ineffectively represented by his former attorneys in these proceedings.
 
Through his motion to reopen, the respondent has requested consideration for adjustment of status based upon his marriage to a United States citizen. Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). However, the Notice to Appear reflects that the respondent was orally given the warnings for failure to appear. Consequently, he is ineligible for adjustment of status consideration for a 10-year period following the date of the entry of the final order of removal. See section 240(b)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(b)(7).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider and the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider and the motion to reopen are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tijerina, Lorenzo W., Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated July 26, 2004. This case was last before us on July 26, 2004, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s April 24, 2003, decision finding that the respondent had waived his right apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, because he failed to timely file the required application. We also noted that we would not consider ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised for the first time on appeal. The respondent has asked us to reconsider our prior order. The unopposed motion is granted. On reconsideration, we find that the respondent substantially complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and he has established that his prior counsel’s behavior prejudiced his case. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Respondent’s former counsel, Joe A. Gamez, admits that he failed to timely file the respondent’s 212(c) application thereby precluding the respondent from applying for such relief. On reconsideration, these proceedings will be reopened and remanded to afford the respondent the opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marc Van Der Hout, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patrick T. Barry
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen has been filed out of time. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on September 4, 2002. The motion to reopen was filed late, on June 9, 2004. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
The respondent argues that the deadline for filing his motion to reopen should be tolled due to alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent was represented by attorney Walter Pineda at the removal hearing, and on appeal to this Board. He argues that Pineda represented him in a petition for review filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and on May 3, 2004, learned from Pineda that the case had been dismissed. On May 18, 2004, he engaged current counsel, and the pending motion was filed on June 9, 2004. Guided by Ninth Circuit precedent, we find that the respondent exercised diligence in submitting the pending motion, and the deadline for such motion should be tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (court found that to the extent equitable tolling applies, based on actions of prior counsel, limitations period begins when respondent meets with new counsel and learns of fraud).
 
As noted, the respondent claims that Pineda provided ineffective assistance concerning his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). Specifically, the respondent claims that Pineda erred by failing to present evidence concerning the hardship the respondent’s mother would face in the event of the respondent’s removal. The respondent’s mother became a lawful permanent resident while the respondent’s appeal was pending at the Board; the respondent asserts that Pineda should have sought either a remand to the Immigration Judge (while the appeal was pending at the Board), or should have filed a timely motion to reopen after our September 4, 2002, decision. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act (hardship to lawful permanent resident parent relevant to whether cancellation of removal should be granted). The respondent has presented evidence concerning his mother’s financial and emotional dependence on him, as well as evidence concerning her numerous medical and emotional problems. The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62; (BIA 2003), Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 The respondent asserts that, when he met with representatives of Pineda’s office in 1997, he was not told that hardship to a lawful permanent resident parent could be relevant (Respondent’s Affidavit). He further argues that Pineda spent little time with him concerning his claim. Id. The respondent admits that he did not inform Pineda that his mother had become a lawful permanent resident in 2001, but states that he did not realize that this might be important. Id. The respondent states that, prior to his mother becoming a lawful permanent resident, he spoke with Pineda and asked him if his mother could submit a petition on his behalf. Id. According to the respondent, this did not cause Pineda to ask whether his mother had a residence petition pending. Id. We acknowledge that Pineda submitted a letter arguing that the respondent was at fault for not informing him about the change in his mother’s status. The DHS similarly argues that, given his inaction, the respondent did not suffer ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent’s assertions that he was not fully advised concerning the requirements for cancellation of removal are not directly refuted by Pineda in his letter.
 
Further, we agree with the respondent that his situation is similar to that of the respondent in Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004). In that case, the court considered an argument that an attorney, who has been expelled from practice before the Board and the Ninth Circuit, failed to present evidence concerning the respondent’s mother, who became a lawful permanent resident while the appeal was pending before this Board. As evidence concerning the mother “may have affected the proceedings”, id. at 858-59, the Ninth Circuit found, the Board required too stringent a test for showing prejudice resulting from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, and remanded the case to the Board for further consideration. Given the evidence presented concerning the respondent’s mother, and guided by Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, supra, we find that evidence concerning her hardship “may have affected the proceedings,” had it been presented by Pineda.
 
We therefore find that, based on the respondent’s submissions, a remand to the Immigration Judge is appropriate. On remand, the respondent will have an opportunity to further pursue his application for cancellation of removal. The DHS shall have the opportunity to examine and verify the validity of the respondent’s submissions and present evidence.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Helen B. Zebel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evan R. Franke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal 240A(b); remand
 
The respondents, natives and citizens of Mexico, appeal the Immigration Judge’s June 17, 2003, decision denying their application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). In addition, the respondents allege ineffective assistance of counsel and seek to remand the record in order to have the Immigration Judge reconsider their cancellation application. The motion to remand is denied and the appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondents claim that their attorney failed to adequately prepare their case. They further assert that their attorney failed to submit evidence of their son’s psychological illness. See respondents’ affidavit. Last, the respondents assert that the Immigration Judge erred by failing to give full evidentiary weight to their testimony concerning their children’s medical issues.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred, Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
*2 In addition, we have considered that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
We do not find sufficient evidence to establish that the respondents were prejudiced as a result of their attorney’s ineffectiveness. The respondents’ attorney questioned them extensively about their children’s past medical history (Tr. at 15-23). The record is replete with supporting documents showing past appointments with medical doctors (Exh. 7-8). However, there are no documents to show that any of the respondents’ children have been diagnosed with an illness for which they would not be able to receive treatment in Mexico. The respondents allege in their affidavit that their son’s doctor had “faxed” a letter to the immigration consultant which corroborated their claim about their son’s psychological illness. The respondents have not submitted a copy of the letter with their appeal or a statement from the child’s doctor attesting to the fact that she had faxed the letter and that the child suffers from an illness. The respondents also failed to provide evidence with their appeal which proves that they would have been granted cancellation of removal at the hearing had their attorney then submitted it to the Immigration Court. Hence, we are unable to find that the respondents were prejudiced by their former attorney in these proceedings.
 
We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying cancellation of removal as the respondents failed to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their United States citizen children if they are returned to Mexico. The respondents failed to demonstrate that their removal would cause hardship to their United States citizen children that is substantially different from, or beyond, that which would normally be expected from the deportation of an alien with close family members in the United States. See Matter of Andazola, 23 I&N Dec. 319 (BIA, 2002); Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001). It is well settled that economic detriment and loss of educational opportunities alone are insufficient to support a finding of extreme hardship under former section 244(a) of the Act which is a lower burden of proof standard than the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard under section 240A(b) of the Act. See Matter of Pilch, 21 I&N Dec. 627 (BIA 1996). While we acknowledge that the respondents’ children would suffer some initial hardship if the respondents had to resettle in Mexico, we do not find that their hardship would be substantially different from American children of other deportees. Although the respondents claim that their son Alfredo, suffers from some behavioral problems, the medical evidence of record does not show that any of the children suffer from any life threatening or chronic illnesses (Tr. at 15-23). Moreover, there is no evidence that they would be deprived of medical services and educational opportunities in Mexico. The children, who are young, can readily assimilate in Mexican society because of their tender age. In light of the factors in this case, we find that the respondents’ United States citizen children would not suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if the respondents are returned to Mexico. Matter of Monreal, supra.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f).
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ashwani Bhakhri, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jo Ellen Ardinger
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on November 14, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. As the Board did not receive the motion until August 23, 2004, it was therefore filed out of time.
 
We do not find that the respondent’s case falls within the Ninth Circuit’s equitable tolling policy for aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit has stated that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with clue diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 897. The respondent admittedly personally received the Board’s adverse decision, which contains a footnote advising her that her former attorney, Mr. Gadda, had been “suspended from practice before the Board.” Yet the respondent asserts that she nonetheless then contacted that same attorney for assistance in filing a federal appeal of the Board’s decision.
 
We initially note that the respondent’s motion is defective as she has not provided an affidavit outlining in detail the agreement she asserts she had with Mr. Gadda, nor a letter informing him of the complaint against him. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent claims she last communicated with Mr. Gadda in July of 2003, when she was told the appeal was pending. She has not identified what, if any, efforts she has undertaken to contact Mr. Gadda and inform him of her contentions against him despite having previously contacted him. Her counsel’s general assertion that Mr. Gadda’s “present whereabouts are unknown” does not constitute competent evidence of the claimed fact and such a statement, even coming from the respondent, fails to detail what, if any, action she took to contact Mr. Gadda. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (a motion to reopen must be supported by “affidavits or other evidentiary material,” and not mere legal assertions). Moreover, the respondent waited more than 21 months to file this motion following the Board’s adverse decision, and more than a year after she last allegedly contacted Mr. Gadda with regard to an appeal of our decision. The respondent has not stated what efforts she undertook in the interim period since July 2003 to ascertain the status of her case. In light of this record, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that her motion is subject to equitable tolling because she has not demonstrated due diligence. Id.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Artem M. Sarian, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen and remand proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 New counsel for the respondent claims that prior counsel misled him regarding the status of his case. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
We have held that to satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support his claim by a detailed affidavit, inform his previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide former counsel with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Here, the respondent has submitted a declaration supporting the claim of ineffective assistance, and the respondent has notified his former counsel and filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority. The respondent indicated that he was advised by counsel at the place of his hearing to leave the hearing location because an outstanding arrest warrant in the respondent’s name was to be executed.2 The respondent stated that he was not subsequently advised by counsel as to the status of his case and therefore was unable to timely appeal.3 We find that the respondent has satisfied a showing of ineffective assistance. Moreover, the respondent has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance. Matter of Aassad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Based upon our finding that the respondent was accorded ineffective assistance of counsel, the record is ordered remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. Accordingly, the motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Footnotes

1

Although the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely filed, the time limitation period at section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act may be equitably tolled under the case law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See Fajardo v. 1NS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002) (the limitation period on motions to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be tolled until petitioner was aware of the harm resulting from attorney’s misconduct). According to the respondent’s affidavit submitted in support of his new claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, the respondent became aware of his former attorney’s initial ineffective assistance only after the respondent counsulted new counsel in February 2004.

2

Counsel for the respondent indicated on appeal that the respondent failed to appear at his hearing because of traffic gridlock. The respondent stated in his bar complaint that he appeared prior to the commencement of proceedings but was advised by counsel prior to the start of his hearing to leave for tactical purposes. The respondent’s former counsel did not respond to the respondent’s bar complaint.

We note that the appeal submitted on the respondent’s behalf does not contain the respondent’s signature.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated July 21, 2004. The respondents (AXX XXX XXX/XXX/XXX/XX XXX XXX) allege ineffective assistance of their prior counsel. Statements made by the respondents in a motion are not evidence and are thus not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of S-M-, 22I&N Dec. 49,51 (BIA 1998); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Moreover, in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), the Board required that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he or she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. It is crucial that the respondents’ prior attorney be given “the opportunity to respond to the allegation¿sº of ineffectiveness,” due to the charges made by the respondent. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondents have failed to comply with any of the above requirements. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, see Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002) (Lozada “factors are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance”). However, in this case the record does not show a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. The need for notification and response from former counsel is critical to our meaningful assessment of this claim. Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marc Van Der Hout, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle Guardino,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen these proceedings. On May 10, 2002, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand proceedings based on a second marriage to a United States citizen that occurred on November 2, 2001. On January 23, 2003, we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, pointing out that it was supported by essentially the same documents that we found, in our May 10, 2002, decision, to be inadequate to meet the “clear and convincing” test of Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 254 (BIA 2002). Thus, the respondent was on notice, at least by the time of our January 23, 2003, decision that his former attorney submitted the same documents. A second motion to reopen was denied by the Board on July 23, 2003, because it was number barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent has now filed a third motion to reopen, raising for the first time a claim of ineffective assistance from his prior counsel. The motion is both number barred and untimely. We reject the respondent’s argument that the limitations on motions should be equitably tolled. Our January 23, 2003, decision placed the respondent on notice that the same documents had been submitted, and our July 23, 2003, notice advised him that he had exhausted his opportunity to reopen under the motions regulation. Yet, the respondent waited until June 28, 2004, to file a motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. After our prior decisions, the respondent cannot be found to have reasonably relied on his former counsel to cure the deficiencies in his prior motions. We find that he has failed to demonstrate that the time limitation should be equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (if petitioner acts with due diligence upon its discovery, equitable tolling is available if the petitioner was prevented from timely filing because of deception, fraud, or error); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir 2000); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondents have appealed from the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2002, decision denying their application for cancellation of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). While the appeal was pending, the respondents filed a pro se brief, with supporting documents, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and requesting that we remand this case to the Immigration Judge for reconsideration of whether their removal to Mexico would result in “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to either of their United States citizen children. We share the Immigration Judges’ concern regarding the quality of the representation afforded the respondents and given the record before us and the respondent’s arguments on appeal question the fairness of the of the hearing below. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). We conclude, therefore, that the respondents should be afforded the opportunity to seek new counsel and to have the merits of their application for relief reconsidered at a new hearing before the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, we issue the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is sustained and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ana M. Franco, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a March 25, 2004, decision, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. With his Notice of Appeal, the respondent filed a brief. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the respondent’s appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
An Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia after he failed to appear for a March 5, 2004, immigration court hearing. On March 22, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his proceedings. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen on March 25, 2004, finding that the respondent had been provided notice of his hearing date. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion to reopen. Counsel argued in the motion to reopen, and on appeal, that she “lost contact” with the respondent, due to an office move, and did not ensure that the respondent knew of the March 5, 2004, hearing date. Counsel implicitly argues that she provided ineffective assistance to the respondent by not making him aware of the hearing date. However, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Most critically, there is no detailed affidavit from the respondent explaining his version of events and the alleged confusion over the hearing date.
 
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria K. Woroby, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the June 10, 2004, decision and order of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider her May 20, 2004, order denying a second motion to reopen removal proceedings to rescind an in absentia order based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The first motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order was denied on March 30, 2004. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia on August 1, 2003. The appeal will be dismissed, and the request to remand will be denied.
 
The procedural posture of the appeal before this Board is a limited one.1 This appeal is limited to whether the Immigration Judge erred in her June 10, 2004, decision to deny the motion to reconsider her May 20, 2004, order. As noted in that order, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent essentially was seeking a third motion to reopen based on new evidence with respect to compliance with the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. He also failed to challenge or address her prior determination that he can be constructively charged with having received notice of the hearing based on his failure to inform the Immigration Court of his change of address.
 
On appeal the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. For the first time on appeal the respondent has submitted a copy of his record before both the DHS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review which he received pursuant to a Freedom Of Information Act request. This information was not submitted to the Immigration Judge, and this Board may not consider such new evidence for the first time on appeal. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 (BIA 1984). Additionally, the respondent raises new arguments which are not supported by affidavit or other evidentiary material and were previously not raised before the Immigration Judge. Specifically, counsel for respondent argues for the first time that the respondent never received a copy of the Notice to Appear from his former counsel and as a result he never knew of his duty to inform DHS and the Immigration Court of his change of address. Finally, the respondent refers to a recent decision, Ghounem v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 740 (8th Cir. 2004), in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises. He argues that Ghounem requires that this Board remand the record for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the respondent can be constructively charged with having received notice of the hearing date and time.
 
*2 We find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (4)(ii)(2004); see also Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (alien is statutorily barred from rescinding the order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” regardless of whether he can demonstrate that his failure to timely file the motion is attributable to ineffective assistance of counsel). See also sections 240(b)(5)(C) and 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§1229a(b)(5)(C) and 1229a(e)(1) (in absentia order of removal may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” such as the serious illness of a child).
 
We also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent personally received the Notice to Appear and that he could be constructively charged with receiving adequate notice of the time and place of his hearing. See Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540 (BIA 2002). The respondent does not dispute that he was personally served with the Notice to Appear (“NTA,” Exh. 1) which informed him of the charges against him, the consequences of his failure to appear before the Immigration Judge, and his duty to inform the Immigration Court of his change of address. See Immigration Judge Order dated March 30, 2004. The respondent also does not contest that the address on the NTA was the last known address given to the DHS. The respondent admittedly moved from his apartment after the issuance of the NTA but he did not promptly inform the DHS, the Immigration Court, or his own attorney of the move. As a consequence, he failed to receive the notice of the date and time of the hearing before the Immigration Court.
 
For the first time on appeal from the denial of the motion to reconsider the respondent, through counsel, alleges that he never received a copy of the Notice to Appear from his prior attorney and implies that he was personally unaware of the change of address requirement. This argument was not raised before the Immigration Judge, and we do not see that it was addressed in the respondent’s affidavit or in the complaint against former counsel. Similarly, counsel argues in her brief that the respondent was under “pressure” at the time of the Special Registration when he was served with the Notice to Appear. Again, this is the first time this argument is being raised and there is no showing how that affects his service of the Notice to Appear and the warnings contained therein. Moreover, counsel argues that the facts in this case are similar to those in Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 180 (BIA 2001), where we held that entry of an in absentia removal order is inappropriate where the record reflects that the alien did not receive, or could not be charged with receiving, the Notice to Appear that was served by certified mail at an address obtained from documents filed with the Service several years earlier. However, this case is notably distinguishable from G-Y-R-. The respondent personally was served with the Notice to Appear. He was put on notice that he would be informed by the Immigration Court of his future hearing date and that he must inform the DHS and the Immigration Court of any change of address. The current allegation by counsel, whose statements are not evidence, that the respondent never received a copy of the NTA or notice of the warnings and directions regarding the change of address requirement was never raised in an affidavit by respondent before the Immigration Judge or submitted in an affidavit on appeal with the request to remand.
 
*3 Finally, we find that the instant case is also factually distinguishable from the recent decision in Ghounem v. Aschcroft, 378 F.3d 740 (8th Cir. 2004). In Ghounem, an Immigration Judge denied the alien’s motion to reopen removal proceedings to rescind an in absentia order. The alien had received the Notice to Appear with notice that the hearing would be set at a future time and date by the Immigration Court. In the motion to reopen the alien argued that neither he, nor his attorney of record before DHS, received notice of the hearing before the Immigration Court. The notice of hearing had been sent by regular mail. The alien conceded that the notice of hearing had been sent to the correct address of record, but denied that he or his wife had actually received it. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by applying the evidentiary standards set forth in Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995), to deny the motion to reopen by finding a rebuttable presumption of the delivery of the notice of hearing when the notice was sent by regular mail rather than certified mail. The court followed the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2002), which found that regular mail delivery does not have the same strong presumption of effective delivery as certified mail. The court found that an affidavit from the alien swearing that he did not receive notice of the hearing “is enough to rebut the presumption of delivery created by INS records that it sent Ghounem notice by regular mail.” Ghounem v. Ashcroft, supra, at 745. The court remanded with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing as to whether the alien is permitted to reopen his case.
 
In the instant case there is no issue as to whether the presumption of delivery of regular mail applies. The respondent admitted that he moved and failed to inform the authorities and his then attorney before DHS of this change of address. The record contains the envelope which was sent to the last known address of record, and is returned to the Immigration Court as “attempted not known.” Thus, the issue of notice, as it applies in this case, is whether the respondent properly informed the DHS and Immigration Court of his change of address as required in the Notice to Appear. He admittedly did not file a change of address notification and, therefore, is constructively charged with notice of his hearing. Indeed, the statute even provides that written notice is not required when an alien fails to provide a change of address. Sections 239(a)(1)(F)(ii) and (2)(B) of the Act.
 
We recognize the sympathetic factors in this case-- the respondent’s marriage to a United States citizen, the alleged hardship to his wife and the financial hardship to his family abroad if he is removed. However, we do not find that based on the record before us that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the motion to reconsider, or that a remand is required for a new evidentiary hearing.
 
*4 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge denied the first motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order in a decision dated March 30, 2004, which was never appealed to this Board. In that motion the respondent argued that he lived in the same building as the address of record, but merely moved apartments; that his attorney of record before the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) was never given notice of the hearing date before the Immigration Court; and, that he was not required to pay the fee to file the motion to reopen. Similarly, the respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s May 20, 2004, denial of the second motion to reopen, which was based on alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel and new evidence in the form of the respondent’s affidavit relating his relationship with former counsel.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Angela M. Bean, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This is the fourth time that this case has been before the Board. On April 6, 1999, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied his motion to reopen deportation proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. On September 8, 2003, we denied a motion to reopen our April 6, 1999, decision. On February 3, 2004, we again declined to reopen the respondent’s case. The respondent filed yet another motion to reopen on April 7, 2004, which is untimely as not filed within 90 days of our final administrative order of April 6, 1999. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
An order of deportation issued following proceedings conducted in absentia could be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrated that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances. The Board lacks jurisdiction to consider such a motion to reopen in the first instance. Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The Board has jurisdiction to consider an appeal, when a motion to reopen an in absentia order is denied by an Immigration Judge. Id. at 646. We considered, and denied, such an appeal in this case. The respondent now, for the third time, seeks to have the Board reopen its decision.
 
Even if the untimeliness of the motion were excused, it would be denied. The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney, Edwin Peralta-Millan, who represented him at the time of his January 18, 1995, in absentia hearing. Then, according to the respondent, three more attorneys, Natasha Samus, Douglas Lehrman, and Marc Van Der Hout, inadequately pursued claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against Peralta-Millan.
 
Both the Immigration Judge, and this Board, have already evaluated the actions of attorney Peralta-Millan and found that they did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. In his motion to reopen submitted to the Immigration Judge, the respondent asserted that, on the morning of the January 18, 1995, deportation hearing, he had agreed to pick up Peralta-Millan. The attorney was late, and, the respondent argued, he was therefore late for his deportation hearing. The Immigration Judge, in denying the untimely motion to reopen submitted by the respondent, found that the respondent was aware of the date, time, and place of his scheduled hearing, and he “failed to establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear” (I.J. July 9, 1997). We affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 In our September 8, 2003, decision, we considered the respondent’s claim that Peralta-Millan had caused him to be late. We found that the respondent had failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Peralta-Millan.
 
The pending motion argues, yet again, that the respondent failed to appear for his January 18, 1995, deportation hearing because of exceptional circumstances, namely, the actions of attorney Peralta-Millan (Respondent’s Mot., at 1, 3). We again find that the respondent failed to establish such exceptional circumstances. He asserts that his attorney insisted on receiving a ride to the migration court, and counsel’s lateness caused the respondent to be late for the immigration hearing (Respondent’s Mot., at 6, 10-13; Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶ 10). Again, we find this excuse inadequate to reopen the in absentia order. The respondent was aware of the time and place for the scheduled hearing, and knew how long it took to travel to the courthouse (Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶¶ 7, 10). Although counsel may have asked the respondent for a ride, there is no assertion that the attorney told him not to attend the deportation hearing. When the attorney was late for the requested ride, it was the respondent’s decision to wait rather than proceed to the deportation hearing (Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶ 10). Compare Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (respondent demonstrated exceptional circumstances for failing to appear at hearing, where attorney’s employee told him incorrectly that he should not appear at immigration hearing because the case had been postponed). In Matter of Grijalva, supra, at 474, the respondent was “blatantly misled regarding his need to appear at the scheduled hearing.” The respondent did not show that he was similarly misled by Peralta-Millan. The respondent therefore failed to show exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the deportation hearing, and there is no basis upon which to reopen these proceedings. We specifically find no reason to reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), as the respondent requests (Respondent’s Mot., at 26-28).
 
The pending motion is therefore denied, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcia S. Kasdan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charles Parker, Jr.
Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime of moral turpitude
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Removability
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated April 12, 2004, finding the respondent removable: as a alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within 5 years of admission for which a sentence of 1 year or more may be imposed as defined in section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i); and, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that his conviction on September 27, 2002, for endangering the welfare of children under New Jersey Statutes Annotated 2C:24-4a is neither an aggravated felony nor a crime involving moral turpitude. Rather, he claims it is a petty offense. Furthermore, the respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceeding.
 
An aggravated felony, as defined under the Act, includes sexual abuse of a minor. See section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act. In this case, the respondent was convicted of endangering the welfare of children under N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:24-4a.1 The Indictment specifically reflects that the respondent engaged in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of A.L., born February 16, 1989, a child less than 16 years of old. Thus, the respondent’s conviction constitutes sexual abuse of a minor and, thus an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act. See Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 22 I&N Dec. 991 (BIA 1999) (indecent exposure in the presence of a child by one intent on sexual arousal is clearly sexual abuse of a minor). Consequently, the respondent’s classification of the conviction as a petty offense is without merit, especially since the respondent was sentenced to community supervision for life.
 
The respondent also claims that his conviction is not a crime involving moral turpitude which renders him removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. Section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act specifically provides that an alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within 5 years of admission for which a sentence of 1 year or more may be imposed is deportable. In this case, the respondent’s conviction for endangering the welfare of children under N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:24-4a is a crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Imber, 16 I&N Dec. 256 (BIA 1977) (sexual misconduct with a female under age 16 is a crime involving moral turpitude). Furthermore, the respondent was admitted to the United States on March 4, 2000, and he was convicted of endangering the welfare of children on September 27, 2002. Thus, he was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within 5 years of his admission. Moreover, the respondent’s conviction was for a “crime of the third degree” under N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:24-4a. A person convicted of a crime of the third degree may be sentenced to imprisonment between 3 to 5 years. See N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:43-6a(3). Therefore, the respondent’s conviction renders him removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings. Thus, the respondent is attempting to collaterally attack his criminal conviction. However, the Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgement of conviction, unless that judgement is void on its face. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). Accordingly, the respondent’s argument is without merit.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Christopher J. Todd, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURAM. The respondents have filed a motion to reopen our decision of March 1, 2004. The respondents, through counsel Eric A. Dumars, filed the motion to reopen on May 28, 2004, asserting that they were ineffectively represented at their hearing before the Immigration Judge. The lead respondent was unable to identify the attorney who represented them in immigration court. Further, her affidavit did not detail the agreement with the attorney or articulate with any specificity what information and evidence she provided him which was not submitted to the Immigration Judge. Finally, since the lead respondent did not know the identity of their attorney, she was unable to contact him or her or to file a disciplinary complaint. In short, there is essentially no compliance with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (the absence of an affidavit outlining the agreement with counsel will not be excused where the facts underlying the petitioner’s claim are not plain on the face of the administrative record).
 
On September 8, 2004, the respondent, through yet another counsel, Christopher J. Todd, filed a motion to hold in abeyance our decision on the May 28, 2004, motion to reopen filed by attorney Dumars until he is able to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. Counsel Todd argues that he is unable to perfect an ineffective assistance of counsel claim until he obtains a copy of the transcript identifying the attorneys who represented the respondents during the course of their proceedings and the nature of the testimony presented.
 
As a general rule, motions should be accompanied by all of the necessary supporting evidence at the time of the original filing. Further, we are not inclined to delay the adjudication of the respondents’ motion since the record shows that, on May 16, 2003, a transcript was mailed directly to the respondents, who appeared pro se on appeal. Therefore, the information needed to establish a Lozada claim was already in their control. The transcript shows that the lead respondent was repeatedly questioned at her hearing about whether there were any other hardships that her family would face if they were removed to Mexico, and she made no mention of the domestic abuse theory of relief that is raised in the motion (Tr. at 22, 30 AXX XXX XXX-35).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motions are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Garry L. Davis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sabrina Hall
Deputy District Counsel
*1 On June 11, 2002, the Board remanded this case to an Immigration Judge so the respondent could apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On January 24, 2003, an Immigration Judge determined that, having failed to submit her 212(c) application timely, the respondent had abandoned her pursuit for relief. The respondent was ordered deported to Guatemala.
 
The respondent then filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied on March 6, 2003. The basis of the motion to reopen, filed by former counsel, was that the respondent filed the 212(c) application with the DHS, but failed to file a copy with the immigration court. The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on May 5, 2004. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board on August 2, 2004. She argues that former counsel is to blame for the late-filed application, and asserts that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent submits a letter from former counsel, in which counsel assured her that the 212(c) application had been filed “as required by the Immigration Court.”
 
The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion. The basis for the DHS opposition is that it does not have the respondent’s file, and therefore opposes the motion. The DHS sought an extension of time to supplement its answer, but despite the passage of more than a month since its August 16, 2004, filing, has not done so.
 
The respondent’s motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge in order that the respondent may be afforded another opportunity to apply for section 212(c) relief.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerald Burns, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; cancellation of removal
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen before the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”). We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The respondent argued therein that the ineffective representation of former counsel resulted in a determination by the Board and Immigration Judge that the respondent was not entitled to cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. We note that the Board previously affirmed the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent failed to satisfy the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship requirement for cancellation of removal. The motion is denied.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has submitted an affidavit and filed a complaint with the bar association against his former attorney. There is no indication, however, that former counsel was advised of the allegation, and given an opportunity to respond. Former counsel did, however, learn of the complaint from the bar association, and he wrote a response letter that is contained in the record. Therein, former counsel indicated that the respondent did not comply with Matter of Lozada, supra in that he did not receive a copy of the respondent’s allegation. Despite the respondent’s failure to directly notify his former counsel of the allegations contained in his motion to reopen due to ineffective assistance of counsel, we will find that the Matter of Lozada, supra procedural requirements are met.
 
*2 The issue remaining for the Board to decide is whether the respondent’s counsel represented the respondent in an egregious manner that it rendered the hearing unfair, and the outcome would have been different but for the negligence of counsel. See Matter of B-B-, supra. Herein, the Immigration Judge noted several items of proof which should have been provided by the respondent which would have been helpful in deciding the issue of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the qualifying relatives (See I.J. at 8, 9). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent and his counsel were lax by not presenting those items at the hearing.
 
In support of the motion, the respondent has provided to the Board an affidavit, the birth certificates of his three United States citizen children, proof that he has legal custody over his oldest child, Nancy Toure, and recent background evidence concerning conditions in the Ivory Coast1. Regarding the custody issue of Nancy Toure, we recognize that the Immigration Judge found significant that the respondent did not introduce proof that he had legal custody over her. However, the respondent testified at the hearing that he had legal custody over his daughter. It was also indicated that the child lives with her mother during the school year, and spends vacations with the respondent (Tr. at 26). We further note that the respondent testified that his children would remain in the United States, and not return with him to the Ivory Coast (Tr. at 30). In addition, we note that the respondent’s affidavit and motion does not provide any additional evidence regarding how his children would be adversely impacted whether personally or financially by the respondent’s removal. Consequently, even now considering that the respondent is the legal custodian of his daughter and helps in her support, we cannot conclude that the respondent satisfied his burden of proving that he is prima facie eligible for a grant of cancellation of removal. It follows that the respondent has failed to prove in his motion that he was prejudiced by the representation of former counsel. See Matter of B-B-, supra.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Howard M. Rosengarten, Esquire
 
APPLICATION:. Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 1, 2004, in which she denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on September 21, 2000. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judg erred in requiring the respondent to demonstrate exceptional circumstances in order to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent further asserts that she should be afforded an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status because she was never advised of the consequences for failing to appear. In her motion to reopen, the respondent also claimed that she failed to appear for her hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
A review of the record reflects that the respondent filed her motion to reopen on February 19, 2004. Therefore the respondent failed to file her motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the final order, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) and Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act).1 However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 130 (2nd Cir. 2000). An alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period that the alien seeks to toll. Id. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on September 21, 2000. The respondent indicated in her motion that an individual acting as an attorney told her that she need not appear for her hearing and that he would represent her at the hearing. Furthermore, after a few months, when the respondent returned to this individual’s office to inquire about the status of her case, the respondent discovered that he had moved and had left no forwarding address. The respondent then waited over three years to file a motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence required for equitable tolling. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at the hearing on September 21, 2000.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent also seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).2 Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).3 Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision. She is accordingly precluded from having her motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.4 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

1

We note that Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings pursuant to section 242B of the Act. However, as section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act sets forth identical language to that contained in section 242B(c)(3), we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, by analogy.

2

We note that Matter of M-S-, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings and involved the interpretation of sections 242B(e)(1) and (5) of the Act, relating to the limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a deportation hearing. However, as section 240(b)(7) of the Act sets forth a similar limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a removal hearing, we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of M-S-, supra, by analogy.

3

Pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3), a motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.

4

We therefore decline to address the issue of prima facie eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the respondent would deserve a favorable exercise of discretion.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Evelyn Marsh, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 12, 2003, decision denying her motion to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of deportation entered on May 8, 1997. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We reject the respondent’s argument that she did not receive proper notice of her hearing because she did not actually receive the Notice of Hearing. The Notice of Hearing was sent by certified mail to the respondent’s address of record, as required by section 242B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(a)(2) (repealed). The fact that the Notice was returned by the United States Postal Service as “unclaimed” does not render service inadequate. Fuentes-Argueta v. INS, 101 F.3d 867 (2d Cir. 1996); Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540 (BIA 2002); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). The respondent now admits that the address she provided to the Immigration Court was not in fact her address, but rather was the address of her former lawyer (Exh. 7). We have held that an alien can be charged with receiving proper notice when notice “reaches the correct address but does not reach the alien through some failure in the internal workings of the household.” Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001). The situation alleged by the respondent is similar to but not as benign as the example given in Matter of G-Y-R-, supra. The respondent deceived the court by providing an incorrect address in order to obtain a change of venue, and will be charged with receiving proper notice of her hearing when the Notice of Hearing was mailed to that address. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge did not err by entering an in absentia order of deportation.
 
With respect to her ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has not shown that she acted with the requisite due diligence during the period of time she now seeks to equitably toll in order to render timely her motion to reopen. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). She submits that she asked her former lawyer about the status of her case “many times” and did not learn of the in absentia order until September 20, 2003 (Exh. 7). In her brief on appeal, the respondent asserts that the last time she saw her former lawyer was on June 4, 1997, and that the next time she went to his office it was closed and no forwarding address was posted. While we cannot consider assertions made in a brief as they are not evidence of record, we acknowledge the respondent’s assertions because even if they had been properly set forth in an affidavit they would not establish that the respondent acted with due diligence. The fact that her lawyer essentially packed up and disappeared should have put her on notice that his representation in her case was deficient, and at least warranted an inquiry to the Immigration Court. The respondent does not assert that she made any inquiry into the status of her case after learning that she had been abandoned by her lawyer. Under these circumstances, the respondent has not demonstrated that she is entitled to equitable tolling of the time for filing a motion to reopen.
 
*2 For these reasons, the appeal will be dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary J. Yerman, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On March 24, 2004, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On August 26, 2004, the respondent attempted to file a motion to reopen, but the motion was rejected by the Board’s Clerk’s Office because the respondent did not include the required fee or a fee waiver request form. The respondent then filed the motion on September 10, 2004. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. With certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before June 23, 2004. The respondent contends that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we considered this issue in our previous decision, and the ineffective assistance of counsel that the respondent complains of in the instant motion relates to an earlier failure of the respondent to appear at his scheduled removal hearing on October 9, 2002. Therefore, the reliance upon equitable tolling is misplaced as the respondent has not raised it as an excuse for the insist untimely motion. The respondent’s request for sua sponte reopening will be denied. “As a general rule, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions relations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002); Matter of J-J-,21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent has not established a truly exceptional case for such a an extraordinary remedy.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is appealing the Immigration Judge’s February 4, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings so that his in absentia order of removal may be rescinded. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) agrees with the Immigration Judge’s decision. See DHS’s Appeal Brief.
 
We affirm and adopt the Immigration Judge’s decision and with the following comments the appeal will be dismissed. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the ¿I ºmmigration ¿Jºudge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The respondent argues that he did not appear at his hearing scheduled for November 19, 2003, because he was informed by his attorney that a continuance had been requested, and that it was not necessary for him to appear at the hearing. The respondent avers that he learned of the denial of the continuance request only after the entry of the in absentia order of removal. The respondent also complains that a subsequent motion to reopen was improperly filed. The respondent thus argues that he did not appear at the removal hearing because of his prior counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness, yet he has not complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for assessing whether an alien has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Before we determine if an attorney’s representation was ineffective and affected the outcome of his case we require that an alien first provide (1) an affidavit detailing the agreement between the movant and counsel; (2) a showing that the allegations of ineffective assistance were communicated to counsel and that he or she was given an opportunity to respond to them; and (3) a statement as to whether a complaint was filed against counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities and if not why not. The respondent has complied with none of these requirements.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had been properly notified concerning the date, time, and place of the hearing in question, that no continuance request was granted, and the respondent failed to provide an affidavit of explanation for his failure to appear with the motion.
 
*2 As we find that the respondent has failed to establish that he did not receive notice of his hearing, and that he has not established exceptional circumtances for his failure to appear, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent argues on appeal that she was provided ineffective assistance of counsel because her former counsel failed to adequately present her case. In support of the respondent’s argument, she has submitted evidence that she has filed a grievance with the state bar disciplinary committee.
 
We find that in the absence of evidence of a determination by state disciplinary authorities that the respondent’s former counsel’s representation was faulty the respondent’s argument lacks merit. The record indicates that the Immigration Judge addressed the arguments that the respondent claims were not properly presented by counsel, namely that her husband may lose some medical coverage through her and her husband may suffer future work-related medical problems.1 I.J. at 9. In sum, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her former counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

The respondent also contends that her former counsel failed to raise the issue of her diabetic condition. We note that hardship to the respondent is not an element considered by an Immigration Judge regarding an application for cancellation of removal. Only hardship to qualifying family members may be considered. 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(D). Even though hardship to the respondent is not an element for cancellation of removal, we note that the Immigration Judge discussed the respondent’s diabetic condition, I.J. at 4.

Michael Steinberg
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The record reflects that the respondent appeared before an Immigration Judge, and requested the opportunity to voluntarily depart the United States. His request was granted. On appeal, the respondent argued that his attorney did not advise him of the consequences of his actions. He also indicated that he may not have been competent at the time he appeared before the Immigration Judge. He requested a new hearing. The respondent has failed to comply with the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). He also presented no evidence, and we cannot detect any from the transcript, that the respondent lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature of the removal proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander Morales, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on November 13, 2002. On July 22, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue our previous decision.
 
The respondent alleges that she received assistance from an individual, Ron Martinez, who worked under the supervision of attorney Walter Burrier. The respondent claims that when she received a copy of the Board’s November 13, 2002, decision, she consulted Martinez, who failed to tell her about the deadline for filing a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and instead told her to wait to take action until her son’s visa petition was approved. Martinez responded to the charges by saying that the respondent appeared pro se before the Board, and therefore he cannot be blamed for her failure to file a court action. However, Martinez does not directly address the respondent’s assertion that she consulted him after receiving the Board’s decision. The respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, and we will treat the motion as unopposed. The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003)(Board has authority to reissue decision).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 13, 2002, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Raymond Fasano, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated April 13, 2004, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has moved to “reconsider/reopen.” The motion is one to reopen, not reconsider. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991) (discussing the difference between motions to reopen and reconsider). The motion will be denied.
 
First, in the motion to reopen the respondent claims that his previous counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The respondent alleges that his former counsel did not adequately explain to him the ramifications of refusing to abide by the voluntary departure order, that former counsel never asked the respondent why he feared returning to Indonesia, and when he became a Pentecostal Christian.
 
Matter of Lozada 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
It is crucial that the respondent’s former counsel be given “the opportunity to respond to the allegation¿sº of ineffectiveness,” due to the charges made by the respondent. See Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 374 (3rd Cir. Jan. 5, 2003) (A requirement of Lozada includes filing a motion and giving the allegedly ineffective counsel an opportunity to respond). See also Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132 (3d Cir. 2001)(citing Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 639).
 
The respondent did file a bar complaint against former counsel and apparently notified him of that complaint. However, there is no evidence in the motion that former counsel was notified of the instant Lozada motion and given an opportunity to respond. As we stated in Matter of Lozada, at 639, “before allegations of ineffectiveness are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion” (emphasis added). We noted that the high standard which we enunciated was necessary if the Board is to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before us. Id. See also Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (“Even if Asaba had presented evidence that he notified Ozulumba, he failed to meet Lozada’s requirement that counsel be provided an opportunity to respond before filing the motion to reopen); Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 599 (9th Cir.2004)(affirming the Board’s decision where petitioner did not prove that he gave former counsel “notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond”). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 The respondent has also failed to establish that he in fact received ineffective assistance of counsel. The record reflects that former counsel introduced documentation in support of the respondent’s applications including country conditions in Indonesia, and conducted direct examination of the respondent. Former counsel did bring out the fact that the respondent a Pentecostal Christian (Tr. at 20). Concerning the respondent’s allegation on the subject of voluntary departure, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge orally explained the consequences to the respondent if he refused to voluntarily depart from the United States. (Tr. at 45-46). The respondent was also provided a written warning to the same effect. To advance a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate prejudice, i.e., he “must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Uspango v. Ashcroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3d Cir. 2002). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair: See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). The respondent has made no such showing. See also Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 131 (3d Cir.2001). The respondent is dissatisfied with former counsel’s representation because he lost his case, but he has not shown that the hearing was unfair or that he was “prevented from reasonably presenting his case.”
 
The respondent also moves to reopen based upon a change in country conditions. The documentation that the respondent has attached to his motion does not differ materially from the documentation that was submitted during the removal proceeding. Moreover, most of the documentation pre-dates the respondent’s removal hearing which concluded on February 5, 2003, and thus can not be considered new evidence. On review, we do not find that the respondent has established changed country conditions within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). A motion to reopen under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) will not be granted unless the movant establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988).
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
HILTS, TODD, J.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 02, 2003. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for cancellation of removal because she has not established the requisite continuous physical presence. The respondent testified that she arrived in the United States after April 1992; the Notice to Appear was served on the respondent in February 2002. Because of the inability to establish continuous physical presence, the respondent is not eligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(b)(1)(A) of the Act. On appeal, the respondent has raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel below. However, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and no claim has been established. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Pauw, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric Bakken
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s October 22, 2002, decision denying her request for a continuance pending her appeal of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) denial of a visa petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen husband. While the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision was pending, the respondent submitted a motion to remand in order to pursue her application for adjustment of status.
 
A decision whether to continue deportation proceedings to a later date is committed to the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge. Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. A continuance may be granted, in the Immigration Judge’s discretion, if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. A decision to deny a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra; Matter of Namio, 14 I&N Dec. 412 (BIA 1973). As the respondent requested, in essence, an indefinite continuance we find no error on the part of the Immigration Judge in denying the same. On appeal the respondent suggests that the attorney she retained to pursue her visa petition provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent has not satisfied the requirements for making such a claim as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). However, the respondent has not satisfied any of the noted requirements, nor has she shown that their purpose has been otherwise met. As such, a remand on that basis is not warranted.
 
The respondent submitted a motion to remand in July 2003 generally asserting that she and her husband have filed a new visa petition, and that she is, therefore, eligible for adjustment of status. The DHS opposes the respondent’s motion, noting that the respondent has filed this visa petition while an appeal of the denial of her first visa petition remains pending and that both visa petitions were filed by the same petitioner. Here the factors enumerated in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) are not present. For example, the DHS does not base its opposition on our holding in Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992), but notes that the respondent admittedly had sexual relations with her ex-husband while married to the petitioner. We also observe that while the respondent asserts a new visa petition has been filed on her behalf, it is by the same petitioner, based on the same basis for adjustment; their marriage. To follow the logic of the respondent’s motion, she need only repeatedly file visa petitions by the same petitioner and on the same basis to warrant recurrent reopening of her claim. However, as the respondent has not shown that the current visa petition is by a new petitioner and/or on a new basis, she has not demonstrated that it is new, nor has she shown that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880 (BIA 1994); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). As such, a remand is not warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
David Swaim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas R. Murphy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents filed a motion to reconsider with the Board. The respondents argued in their motion that the Board incorrectly found in its order dated July 20, 2004 that they failed to establish that they were the victims of ineffective assistance from their former counsel.
 
Upon review of the record, we note that various submissions that were submitted with the respondents’ motion to reopen were not included at the time of the Board’s prior decision. These documents are now present, and have been reviewed. These documents reveal that the respondents’ former counsel was notified of the allegations against him, and his response to the allegations is included in the record. We therefore conclude that the respondents complied with the requirement that they lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondents’ further argued in their motion that unless ordered by a court, Texas law prohibits them from disclosing whether a disciplinary action has been filed against their former counsel, and they are not required to do so under Matter of Lozada, supra.. Notwithstanding the respondents’ assertions, we note that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes as valid the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir. 2000). We therefore cannot excuse the respondents from the requirement that they must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
In addition, the respondents failed to show that they were prejudiced by their counsel’s failure to file a brief. As we indicated in our earlier decision, this case arises within the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has held that an alien seeking to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show not only that counsel was ineffective, but that he suffered “substantial prejudice” as a result of counsel’s errors. Miranda- Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994); Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993). We repeat, here the respondents fail to show substantial prejudice stemming from their attorneys’ alleged failings. The Immigration Judge denied the respondents asylum and withholding of removal because he determined that the respondents had shown neither past persecution, nor a well-founded fear of future persecution, in their native Peru. In their prior and instant motion, the respondents fail to address how the Immigration Judge erred in coming to this conclusion, or why they would have been granted relief, notwithstanding the failure of counsel to file a brief. The respondents do not present the brief that they claim would have caused the Board to reverse the Immigration Judge’s determination, but instead promise to file such a brief only if the Board issues a new briefing schedule. We therefore find no error in our prior decision, and see no reason to reconsider it.
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondents’ motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nora E. Norman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on June 30, 2004, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s September 12, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s claim that he is a national of the United States, and denied his motion to remand based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.1
 
Through his motion, the respondent reiterates his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that he is a national of the United States. In support of these claims, the respondent has proffered photocopies of the same documents submitted during his proceedings and previously considered by the Board and the Immigration Judge. Because the respondent has failed to submit material, previously undiscoverable evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or his assertion that he is a national of the United States, he has necessarily failed to substantiate his burden for reopening on these bases. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent’s motion makes the new assertion that he is entitled to derivative citizenship, as predicated upon the naturalization of his biological mother in 1985. However, the respondent has failed to make a prima facie showing of derivative citizenship under the section 320 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (“CCA”), Pub. L. No. 106-395, as required by regulation for reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). In particular, this Board has held that the citizenship provisions as enacted by the CCA donor apply retroactively. See Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, 23 I&N Dec. 153 (BIA 2001). As a result, in order to derive United States citizenship under the CCA, a respondent must have been under the age of 18 years at the time the statute was enacted. Id. (Applying the law in effect at the time the last material condition of the statute is met). The record in this case reflects that the respondent, born in 1963, was well over the age of 18 years at the time the CCA was enacted on February 27, 2001. See Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, supra.
 
The respondent is clearly statutorily ineligible for derivative citizenship under the CCA and thus a hearing allowing the respondent to present evidence in support of his claim is not warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Although the respondent captions his motion as a “motion to reopen and reconsider and/or remand,” it is properly classified as a motion to reopen as the respondent alleges new facts to be proven at a hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (2004).

*1 This matter was last before us on April 30, 2004, when we affirmed an Immigration Judge’s orders denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, waiver of inadmissibility, and voluntary departure. The respondent now moves that we reopen proceedings and reconsider our prior decision. The Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motions. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. The motions will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider requests that the original decision be re-examined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Upon review of the motion to reconsider, we find no new legal argument or particular aspect of the case which was overlooked and no ground upon which to reconsider our previous decision.
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, a motion to reopen filed with the Board must, among other things, state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Statements in a motion are not evidence and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). In support of the motion, the respondent submitted evidence claiming her rehabilitation, and evidence reflecting that her removal from the United States would impose on her relatives significant hardship. However, such evidence is essentially cumulative of evidence which was of record at the time of our April 30, 2004, order.
 
The respondent claims that her attorney who represented her during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge failed to raise pertinent objections during the hearing. This, the respondent implies, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, other than advancing the aforementioned allegation in the motions to reconsider and reopen, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements necessary to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, we find it inappropriate to reopen proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Steven P. Brazelton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On April 5, 2004, this Board denied the respondents’ motion to reopen. The respondents have timely filed a motion asking that this Board reconsider our previous decision. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the motion. Upon reconsideration, we will grant the motion to reopen and remand the case for further proceedings.
 
The respondents have submitted evidence that their failure to appear at a hearing on April 14, 2003, likely resulted from the ineffective assistance of counsel. They have submitted evidence that their attorney of record was sanctioned by the State Disciplinary Committee as a result of the ineffective assistance of counsel provided to the respondents, including evidence that counsel failed to inform the respondents of the correct hearing location. The actions of the respondents’ former counsel constitute exceptional circumstances sufficient to excuse the respondents’ failure to appear. Accordingly, the respondents’ motion to reconsider will be granted, proceedings will be ordered reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings on the issue of the respondents’ eligibility for cancellation of removal.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eudene Eunique, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy Nguyen,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motions to reopen and reconsider. We first note that the respondent, in the Notice of Appeal, indicates she is appealing the Immigration Judge’s order dated March 27, 2003. There is no order with that date. Instead, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge issued an order on February 14, 2003, denying the respondent’s January 31, 2003, motion to reopen. On February 28, 2003, the respondent then filed a motion to reconsider, which the Immigration Judge denied on March 20, 2003, apparently considering it a motion to reopen. On April 17, 2003, the Immigration Judge issued another order and Summary Decision denying the respondents motion to reconsider. We will consider the respondent’s appeal to encompass all three orders.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends, as she did in her motion to reopen, that she was provided ineffective assistance of counsel in that her former counsel failed to advise the Immigration Judge during the proceedings that the respondent was married to a United States citizen and also did not file for relief.1
 
A motion to reopen for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and accompanied by all the supporting documentation. 8 C.F.R. §1003.23(b)(3). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the respondent establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. With her motion, the respondent submitted only her certificate of marriage and evidence of her husband’s citizenship. There is no evidence if a visa petition has been filed on her behalf, in addition, no Application to Adjust Status (Form I-486) has been submitted. Moreover, because the respondent does not have an approved visa petition, she must provide clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood, that the marriage is bona fide. Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). The respondent has not provided any document showing joint ownership of property, a lease showing joint tenancy of a common residency, documentation showing commingling of financial resources, or other evidence which might establish the bona fides of his marriage. Id.
 
Regarding cancellation of removal, the respondent likewise has failed to proffer an application for relief, and has failed to show prima facie evidence of her eligibility. Specifically, she has not provided any evidence to show she has been continuously physically present for 10 years’ prior to service of the Notice to Appear. Nor has she articulated how her husband will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if she is removed. See section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
*2 Consequently, we find that the respondent failed to establish eligibility to adjust her status or for cancellation of removal, and as such, she has failed to show that she suffered prejudice from her former counsel’s assistance. “Due process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice to succeed.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 527 (9th Cir. 2000). “Prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Barraza Rivera v. INS, 913 F.2d 1443, 1448 (9th Cir. 1990)). We thus conclude that the Immigration Judge did not err in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

On appeal, the respondent fails to articulate any form of relief for which she might be eligible. In her motions before the Immigration Judge, she maintained that she would be eligible for cancellation of removal and/or adjustment of status.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated October 14, 2003. The respondent requests reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent states that he was unable to timely file a petition for judicial review, because his previous attorney mailed the notice of the Board’s decision to an incorrect address. While the period for filing the motion can properly be tolled due to the ineffective assistance of counsel and fraud, the respondent is expected to file the motion within the specified period for motions to reopen after learning about the Board’s decision. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1196 (9th Cir. 2001). In this case, the respondent states that he learned of this Board’s decision on December 1, 2003. However, he did not file this motion to reopen until April 13, 2004. As the respondent failed to exercise diligence in filing the motion within 90 days of learning about our previous order dismissing the appeal, and as the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion to reopen, we decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Isabel A.N. Thomas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ira L. Mazer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 241(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - failed to comply with conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a male native and citizen of Turkey. This case was last before us on September 26, 2002, when we denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen proceedings. In our September 26, 2002, decision, we found that the respondent’s motion was barred by the numerical limitations delineated in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). With respect to the current motion to reopen, we find that such motion is both untimely and numerically barred. Consequently, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
On March 22, 2004, the respondent filed a third motion to reopen, in which he alleges ineffective assistance of counsel and in which he again seeks to remand proceedings in order to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent’s current motion to reopen must be denied as both untimely filed and numerically barred, as it does not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions to the time and number restrictions on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of the Board’s decision and parties are limited to one motion to reopen).
 
The respondent avers, in his third motion to reopen, that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance because he failed to properly file a previous motion to reopen by the September 30, 1996 filing date, and because he failed to attach (to the first motion to reopen) an application for adjustment of status pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent alleges that this constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and alleges that the failure to properly file his motion to reopen prejudiced his case. Thus, the respondent argues that the time limit for his motion should be subject to equitable tolling and that we should grant his motion to reopen
 
We note that this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit has indicated that it has not decided whether to adopt the remedy of equitable tolling, with regard to filing deadlines delineated in the Act, pertaining to motions to reopen which are based on attorney malfeasance. See Bejar v. Ashcroft, 324 F.3d 127, 131 (FN 1) (3rd Cir. 2003). We note that, even if this approach were adopted, in order to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent would need to show that he acted with “reasonable diligence through the period that he seeks to have tolled.” See generally Iavorski v. U.S. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000). We observe that the respondent was put on notice of his prior counsel’s actions, including the date on which his previous motions to reopen were filed and the fact that an application for adjustment of status was not filed with his first motion to reopen, when we rendered our November 10, 1999, decision, and again when we rendered our September 26, 2002, decision. Yet, the respondent did not file a motion to reopen proceedings, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, until March 22, 2004. Thus, even if we presume that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, and if we presume that equitable tolling is available, we do not find that the respondent acted with reasonable diligence during the period that he wishes to have tolled.
 
*2 In sum, we find that the respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred, and the respondent has failed to establish that equitable tolling (if available) should be applied to the deadline at issue. Hence, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(i)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1.003.2 to reconsider its June 10, 2004, order dismissing the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying an earlier motion to reopen proceedings. The Department for Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
In support of his motion, the respondent has submitted a copy of the New York Departmental Disciplinary Committee Rules and Procedures describing its notice to attorneys of complaints against them and the opportunity provided to the respondent attorneys to respond to the allegations. This material supplements evidence in the file consisting, in relevant part, of an affidavit by the respondent. describing the whole of his immigration proceedings and his interaction with his previous attorney specifically, including the actions and representations that counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, and a cover letter for a complaint against his prior attorney as well as a certified mail receipt reflecting a mailing to the New York Departmental Disciplinary Committee. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (confirming the holding of Matter of Lozada, infra); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (discussing requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 128-29 (2nd Cir. 2000).
 
As such, the respondent appears to have substantially complied with the threshold requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, the motion is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted.

APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 3, 2004. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings, based upon the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent had failed to comply with the requirements for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. On appeal, the respondent argues that he has substantially complied with the requirements for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as set forth in the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and requests that the record be remanded to the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s applications for a waiver of inadmissibility and adjustment of status under sections 212(h) and 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra. In Matter of Lozada, supra, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Maner of Lozada, supra, to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence); see also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 In this matter, we find that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has submitted an affidavit indicating that he provided affidavits and other documents necessary to complete his applications for relief to his former attorney, who he trusted would file the application with the Immigration Court in a timely manner and failed to do so. Additionally, the respondent submitted an affidavit from his current attorney, which indicates that he mailed a copy of the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings to his prior attorney, in an effort to provide him notice of the allegations made against him. The respondent also submitted a copy of the complaint filed with the State Bar of California detailing the ineffectiveness of his prior attorney’s representation and a copy of a letter from the State Bar of California indicating receipt of the complaint. Based upon the respondent’s submissions, we find that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
In addition to the three procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, it is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that a due process violation requires a showing of prejudice, which can be made if counsel’s performance “was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred, Id. In his motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel precluded him from filing his application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act in a timely manner. In support of his motion, the respondent submitted an approved immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) and an application for adjustment of status (Form I-485, Form I-485A). In addition, the respondent has submitted an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act to waive his inadmissibility for a crime involving moral turpitude and an affidavit from his wife alleging the hardship she and her daughters would face if the respondent is removed from the United States. Based upon the evidence in the record, we find that the respondent has established prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel” where counsel “failed, without any reason, to timely file ¿anº application” for suspension where petitioner was prima facie eligible for relief).
 
*3 Inasmuch as the respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and established prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, we remand the record to the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s applications for a waiver of inadmissibility and adjustment of status under sections 212(h) and 245 of the Act. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is sustained and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
John G. Chupa, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISIONS
 
*1 We dismissed the respondents’ appeals in separate decisions on July 14, 2003. On April 26, 2004, the respondents filed a motion to reopen, seeking to have the Board reissue its previous decisions.1 We denied the motion on July 9, 2004. The respondents filed a motion to reconsider on July 19, 2004. We will grant the motion to reconsider, reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue our July 14, 2003, decisions. We note that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposed reopening, but has not provided a position concerning the motion to reconsider.
 
The respondents alleged in their motion to reopen that their former attorney failed to inform them of our July 14, 2003, decision, so that they could file a petition for review with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. They asserted that they learned of our decision in March, 2004, and the motion to reopen was filed the next month. In the affidavit supporting the motion, the lead respondent stated that he had been unable to contact former counsel with the claims, because counsel was “in hiding.” The lead respondent also stated that he was preparing to file a grievance against former counsel. In our July 9, 2004, decision, we found that the respondents had failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 191 & N Dec. 637 (BIA1988). Specifically, we found that the respondents had failed to file a disciplinary complaint against counsel.
 
In the motion to reconsider, the respondents argue that they, in fact, filed a complaint against former counsel with the Michigan Supreme Court Attorney Grievance Commission prior to our July 9, 2004, decision denying the motion to reopen. A review of the record supports this assertion. The respondents submitted a document containing evidence of a grievance prior to the Board’s July 9, 2004, decision, which was not associated with the record prior to our decision. With that pleading, the respondents also submitted another affidavit of the lead respondent, which more fully detailed his attempts to locate former counsel and notify him of the claims. Upon review of the respondents’ submissions, we find that we should reconsider our July 9, 2004, decision. We find that the respondents complied with Matter of Assaad, supra, and Matter of Lozada, supra, for making a claim against counsel. Therefore, although the motion to reopen was filed out of time, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), we will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue our July 14, 2003, decisions. The Board’s decisions will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003)(Board has authority to reissue decision).
 
*2 ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reconsider is granted, and our July 9, 2004, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decisions dated July 14, 2903, attached hereto, are hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daphne M. Query, Esquire
*1 In an order entered on April 28, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen, which is not opposed by the Department of Homeland Security. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent, who seeks to adjust his status, has provided evidence that he divorced his previous wife on April 1, 2003; and married a United States citizen on January 18, 2004. The respondent’s current wife has filed a visa petition on his behalf. An alien who enters into a marriage while in removal proceedings is presumed to have done so to evade the immigration laws of this country, and the burden is on him to demonstrate the bona fides of that marriage. Pursuant to Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), the respondent must demonstrate the following in order to receive consideration of his motion: (1) the motion is timely filed; (2) the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations; (3) the motion is not barred by Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), or on any other procedural grounds; (4) clear and convincing evidence is presented indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide; and (5) the Department does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992).
 
We find sufficient compliance, although barely so, with Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, supra, to warrant reopening and remanding this case, although we emphasize that our remand does not establish the bona fides of the reported marriage. It will be the respondenl’s burden to persuade the Department, in the context of a visa petition, and the Immigration Judge, in the context of adjustment, that his marriage is bona fide and not entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(c)(9)(v).
 
During the forthcoming hearing, the respondent should be given the opportunity to explain why he failed to inform the Board, prior to our order, of the change in his marital status and a change in the number and identity of his family members who were claiming derivative status based on his circumstances, if he, on April 1, 2003, divorced Carmen R. Pinilla Velandia, whose alien number is AXX XXX XXX and who joined him as a derivative claimant during the proceedings. If the Immigration Judge determines that this matter raises an issue of the respondent’s worthiness for the relief he seeks, then it should be specifically addressed.
 
We find nothing in the evidence submitted with the motion to revisit our determination regarding the respondent’s previous allegation that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Should the respondent find that his removal is imminent, he may file an emergency request for a stay with the Board.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ubiwe K. Eriye, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; cancellation of removal; voluntary departure
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 30, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied her motion to remand. On August 2, 2004, the respondent filed the present motion to reopen in which she seeks to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). In support of the motion, the respondent contends that her right to a full and fair hearing was violated because neither the Immigration Judge nor her former attorney informed her that she was eligible to apply for cancellation of removal or voluntary departure. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, has filed no response to the motion. The motion will be granted, the removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11 (a)(2), Immigration Judges have an affirmative duty to inform an alien in removal proceedings of his or her “apparent eligibility” to apply for any form of relief under the Act—including cancellation of removal and voluntary departure—and to afford the alien an opportunity to submit applications for relief during removal hearing. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, holds that this regulatory requirement is “mandatory” and that an Immigration Judge’s failure to inform an alien of her apparent eligibility to apply for relief is a denial of due process that invalidates the underlying proceeding. United States v. Muro-Inclan, 249 F.3d 1180, 1183-84 (9th Cir. 2001); United States v. Arrieta, 224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2000). The precedents of this Board are not to the contrary. Matter of Cordova, 22 I&N Dec. 966, 970-71 (BIA 1999); Matter of Ulloa, 22 I&N Dec. 725, 726 (BIA 1999).
 
Although we express no opinion as to whether the respondent can ultimately sustain her burden of demonstrating eligibility for cancellation of removal or voluntary departure, we conclude at the outset that she was “apparently eligible” for both forms of relief at the time of her prior removal hearing. See sections 240A(b)(1) and 240B(b)(1) of the Act. Specifically, the present record contains no evidence to refute the respondent’s factual assertions as to the length of her physical presence in the United States and, although criminal proceedings are pending against her, she has not to our knowledge been convicted of any crime. The Immigration Judge made no factual determinations with respect to any matter bearing upon the respondent’s moral character, and we find nothing in the record that would necessarily preclude her from demonstrating good moral character during the relevant periods, although the outcome of her pending criminal proceedings could obviously have an impact on this question. Moreover, the respondent is married to a lawful permanent resident of the United States whose hardship is relevant to a determination of eligibility for cancellation of removal, although hardship to the respondent’s son does not appear to be relevant because, as a 22-year-old man, he is no longer a “child” for purposes of the Act. See section 101 (b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (b)(1) (defining a “child”as “an unmarried person under twenty-one years of age…”).
 
*2 Because the respondent was apparently eligible for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the Immigration Judge had a duty to inform her of the availability of these forms of relief and to give her an opportunity to apply for them. Having reviewed the record of proceedings in detail, including the transcript of the respondent’s various removal hearings, we find no indication that the Immigration Judge provided such advisals. The Immigration Judge noted on several occasions that no requests for relief had been submitted to him by the respondent, other than the request for adjustment of status that was the subject of the respondent’s prior proceedings (Tr. at 112, 113), and the Immigration Judge also received a negative reply from the respondent’s counsel when he asked whether the respondent was seeking any relief other than adjustment of status (Tr. at 114). However, the Immigration Judge apparently did not make any independent determination as to the respondent’s eligibility for forms of relief not specifically requested, such as cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, and he plainly did not inform her or her counsel on the record of the existence of such alternative forms of relief. Hence, under applicable Ninth Circuit precedent, the respondent’s due process right to a full and fair hearing was violated in this instance regardless of whether the respondent’s former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted and the record will be remanded so that the respondent’s right to seek relief from removal may be preserved.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The removal proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Parmjeet Kaur Randhawa, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board to reopen the deportation proceedings. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
During the deportation hearing the respondent was represented by his first counsel Kazbek Soobsokov, Esquire. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent withholding of deportation to Iran, but denied his application for 212(c) relief or protection under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent obtained second counsel, Nadia Farah, Esquire, to represent him on appeal. The respondent did not raise any issue of ineffective assistance of his first counsel on direct appeal. On July 16, 2003, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent; through second counsel, moved to reconsider, and on February 5, 2004, the Board denied the motion. On May 28, 2004, the respondent, through present counsel, filed the instant motion to reopen due to the alleged ineffective assistance of his first counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. With certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before October 14, 2003. The respondent contends that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Individuals seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that they have acted with due diligence. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002) (acknowledging that party claiming that equitable tolling applies to reopening deadline must show that he acted with reasonable diligence); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999); Beffa v. Bank of West, 152 F.3d 1174, 1176-77 (9th Cir. 1998)(“¿fºederal courts apply the doctrine of equitable tolling only sparingly, especially in cases in which plaintiffs fail to exercise due diligence”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
We find that the respondent’s appeal deadline should not be equitable tolled. In Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003), the court found equitable tolling when on October 11, 2000, the alien’s former counsel sent him a letter informing him that he had lost his appeal and had to leave the country. The letter also told the alien that he would probably not prevail should he choose to appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit. Immediately thereafter, the alien retained new counsel for advice. The court found that the alien had acted with due diligence in discovering the error. The court emphasized that the alien “promptly retained new counsel,” and “¿lºess than one month elapsed from the denial of the appeal to the date that the alien learned of his former counsel’s allegedly fraudulent and ineffective activities. Id at 899. In the instant case the respondent retained new counsel to represent him on appeal yet the issue was never raised on appeal. The respondent, through second counsel, also filed a motion to reconsider, but never filed a motion alleging ineffective assistance of his first counsel. The respondent has manifestly failed to establish due diligence by waiting over seven months to file the motion after the expiration of the deadline for filing a motion to reopen. We also find that the respondent waived the issue by failing to raise the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when he had retained second counsel on direct appeal. Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196, n.4 (BIA 1990).

IN RE: MOHAMMED, AMIRA
File: AXX-XX2-318 - ARLINGTON
September 1, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hadeed Jr., Michael
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated June 15, 2004. In our June 15, 2004, decision we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The present motion will be denied.
 
Because the respondent submits new evidence, we will consider her motion as a motion to reopen and reconsider.
 
The motion to reopen exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen and will be denied. Our prior order in these proceedings, in which the Board denied a motion to reopen filed by the respondent, was entered on June 15, 2004. The regulations provide that motions to reopen shall be limited to one motion to reopen, with certain exceptions not pertinent here. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen is therefore barred by numerical limitations.
 
The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on October 7, 2003. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2)(with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before January 5, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until July 12, 2004. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
We find no basis to reconsider our June 15, 2004, decision. Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), was decided on March 6, 2002. The respondent, through counsel, did not file her previous motion to reopen until December 12, 2003. The respondent does not allege ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
On our own motion, we correct one error in our June 15, 2004, decision. The regulation we cited should have been 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B) (evidence to establish eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption). This regulation lists the type of evidence necessary to qualify for the exemption from the general prohibition against approval of a visa petition based on an alien’s marriage during proceedings, and supports our findings in our June 15, 2004, decision.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before this Board on March 29, 2004, when we returned the record to the Immigration Judge in order to prepare a separate oral or written decision. On April 23, 2004, the Immigration Court administratively returned the record to this Board for consideration of the respondent’s original appeal with the Oral Decision of the Immigration Judge contained in the record of proceedings. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal. The respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002)(Lozada requirements need not always be rigidly applied); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000) (application of Lozada requirements generally reasonable unless facts relating to claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are apparent in the record). Finally, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
XAVIER ROSAS
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). Contrary to the respondent’s assertions on appeal, the Immigration Judge’s decision reflects that the potential hardships to the respondent’s United States wife of several months were considered (I.J. at 3, 7-8, 10). Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the record fully supports the Immigration Judge’s determination that hardships reaching the exceptional and extremely unusual level were not shown with respect to either his wife or his four-year-old United States citizen child.
 
To the extent that the respondent is now making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we find that, even assuming the respondent had substantially complied with the steps required by Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has not demonstrated any prejudice flowing from the ineffective representation. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that the Lozada requirements need not be rigidly enforced where their objective is achieved); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (there must be a showing of prejudice resulting from the ineffective assistance); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (same).
 
The hardships that the respondent asserts on appeal with respect to each of his qualifying relatives are those common to lawful status family members who are separated from a relative who has no lawful status as a result of removal proceedings. Even if they had been presented at the hearing, full consideration of hardships of this level would not affect the outcome of these proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; voluntary departure; adjustment of status; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 2003, decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b), and voluntary departure. The respondent also requests a remand to apply for adjustment of status. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the record contains insufficient evidence to establish that he was convicted of an aggravated felony and, therefore, the Immigration Judge erred in finding the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal. In addition, the respondent appears to assert that the Immigration Judge’s reliance on that evidence violates the respondent’s right to due process. The respondent’s arguments are without merit.
 
On his application for cancellation of removal, the respondent indicated that he had been convicted of a firearms offense for which he received 2 years of probation (Exh. 3 at 5). During the course of the proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through counsel, informed the court that the respondent was convicted of the offense of possessing a firearm in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. section 922(g)(5), which is an aggravated felony pursuant to section 101(a)(43)(E)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(E)(ii) (Tr. at 23, 50-53, 55-60).
 
The record contains sufficient evidence to support the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony and, as a result, is ineligible for cancellation for removal. See section 240(A)(b)(1)(C) of the Act. The Immigration Judge properly relied on the respondent’s admissions concerning his conviction and afforded the respondent every opportunity to meet his burden of proving eligibility for relief from removal. Furthermore, the respondent was represented by counsel and received a full and fair hearing on the merits of his claim before the Immigration Judge.1 Thus, we find no due process violation or prejudice. As the conviction issue is dispositive, we decline to address the issue of whether the respondent has sustained his burden of proving the requisite level of hardship.
 
In addition, the Immigration Judge properly denied voluntary departure finding that, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony within the proscribed period, the respondent failed to establish the requisite good moral character (I.J. at 8-9). See sections 240B(b)(1)(B), 101(f)(8) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(b)(1)(B), 1101(f)(8). On whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent also requests a remand asserting that, as the beneficiary of an approved visa petition, he is eligible to adjust his status. Although the respondent has submitted a copy of an approved visa petition, he has not submitted a copy of a properly executed adjustment application and supporting documentation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (2004); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment and, therefore, we decline to remand the case. See Matter of S-V-, 20 I&N Dec. 1306, 1307 (BIA 2000); Matter of Coelho, supra. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and the motion to remand is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Davis, Howard R.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 11, 2004. On June 19, 2003, the respondent submitted both an appeal and a motion to reopen. We failed to address his motion. We dismissed his appeal in an order summarily affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings conducted in absentia. The respondent now seeks reopening for our consideration of the motion he previously submitted, as well as a new claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that his former counsel failed to present sufficient evidence and argument which resulted in both the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and our dismissal of his appeal. The respondent has presented evidence that he has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), but he has not clearly demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we find that reopening and remand of the record is warranted in this case so that the Immigration Judge may consider the respondent’s evidence that he gave his correct address to the Department of Homeland Security as reflected on the Notice to Appear and on the Form I-213 dated December 5, 2002, but someone who completed his bond papers listed an incorrect address on Form I-830 and caused the notice of the hearing to be misdirected. We will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s claim that, being unaware of the error, he had no reason to think that he needed to file a change of address with the court.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Richard A. Hujber, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Vera Hochberg
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on July 23, 2003. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before October 21, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until April 26, 2004. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.1 The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has filed an opposition to the motion, based on the untimely filing and on the merits.
 
The respondents assert that they received ineffective assistance by prior counsel. They state that prior counsel did not adequately explain the relief of voluntary departure to them. However, the record reveals that the Immigration Judge provided counsel an opportunity to explain the relief to the respondents, and that the male respondent insisted that he did not want to pursue voluntary departure (Tr. at 19, 39).2 We also note that the respondents were represented by a different attorney at their initial hearing before the Immigration Judge on June 27, 2002, when the issue of voluntary departure and other forms of relief were discussed as well (Tr. at 1-10). The respondents have failed to establish that they received ineffective assistance of counsel in this case.
 
The respondents also allege improprieties by the Immigration Judge in this case. However, we see no reason to overturn our prior order in this case, in which we affirmed without opinion the decision of the Immigration Judge below.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The request for a stay is also denied.

Even as originally submitted on November 6, 2003, and rejected due to filing defects, the motion was untimely.

2

The parties have not contested that finding of the Immigration Judge that the female respondent was not eligible to apply for voluntary departure because the charging document in her case was issued against her within one year of her entry into the United States.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Natalia Nekrasova, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. The final order in these proceedings, in which we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying suspension of deportation, was entered by the Board on September 13, 2002. We granted the respondent’s motion seeking adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen, on May 7, 2003. An Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for adjustment of status on May 30, 2003. On December 16, 2003, we affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge, and determined that we had earlier erred in granting reopening, given that the respondent was ineligible for adjustment of status under Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), for failing to depart under an order of voluntary departure. We denied a motion to reconsider this decision, as untimely filed, on February 25, 2004, and this motion was filed on May 28, 2004. The pending motion was filed late. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent again seeks to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen. In Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), the Board held that a properly filed motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion, notwithstanding the pendency of a visa petition filed on the alien’s behalf, where: (1) the motion to reopen is timely filed; (2) the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations; (3) the motion is not barred by Matter of Shaar, supra, or on any other procedural grounds; (4) clear and convincing evidence is presented indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide; and (5) the DHS does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992).
 
As noted, we found in our December 16, 2003, decision that reopening is barred by Matter of Shaar, supra. Pursuant to former section 242B(e)(2) of the Act, an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief, including adjustment of status. However, the respondent argues that she was unaware that she had to depart under the Board’s September 13, 2002, order, because former counsel led her to believe that filing a motion to reopen would prevent the respondent from overstaying the voluntary departure period (Respondent’s Mot., at 2-3; Exh. 3; Respondent’s Affidavit).
 
*2 Similarly, the respondent argues that the motions deadline should be tolled, based on former counsel’s assurance that our December 16, 2003, decision would be reconsidered, and counsel’s failure to inform her until March 2004, that such efforts had been unsuccessful and the respondent would have to depart the United States.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Under the circumstances, we agree that the motions deadline should be excused. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir. 2004)(motions deadline subject to equitable tolling where lawyer’s actions caused late filing, and respondent thereafter acted with due diligence). Accordingly, the record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present her application for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer S. Goldmeier,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 4, 2003.1 The record reflects that the respondent, through counsel, conceded proper service of the Notice to Appear (NTA), admitted the allegations in the NTA, conceded removability, waived all forms of relief from removal (Tr. at 21-23) and when asked by the Immigration Judge whether he understood and agreed with the plea, the respondent answered in the affirmative (Tr. at 25). The respondent, through counsel, also waived appeal (Tr. at 28).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he was denied a fair hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we note that he has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent did not present an affidavit detailing how he was aggrieved by his former counsel. The respondent did not demonstrate that is former counsel was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond. The respondent did not establish that he filed complaints with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding his former counsel’s ethical or legal violations. Nor did the respondent explain why he has not filed such complaints. Id.; Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish how he has been prejudiced. Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (“To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness”). In this regard, we note that the respondent is removable as one who has been convicted of an aggravated felony (Government Exh. C) and he has failed to specify any relief for which he would be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dwelshauvers, Philippe M., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James R. Knapp,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated January 26, 2004. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before April 26, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until April 28, 2004. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. We note that even if the motion had been timely filed, reopening would be denied because the new evidence offered by the respondent would not change the result in this case. See Matter of Coehlo, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). This is because the respondent was denied voluntary departure for lack of good moral character based on the length of his incarceration, not the fact of his conviction. See sections 240B(b)(1)(B) and 101(f)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(b)(1)(B) and 1101(f)(7);. Insofar as the respondent may seek reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that he has failed to comply in any measure with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (compliance with Lozada generally required). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luisito L. Lopez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 18, 2003, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondent invokes the Ninth Circuit’s equitable tolling policy for aliens who have filed otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit has stated that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra at 897. In the present case, the respondent alleges that he was provided with ineffective assistance because he was told, by a person holding himself out as an attorney, that his immigration hearing would be taken care of and then that person failed to inform the respondent of the Immigration Judge’s January 23, 2002, in absentia decision. The respondent, in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, indicates he first learned of his in absentia order when he received the “bag and baggage” letter on July 14, 2002. The record belies this contention, however.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was mailed a copy of the January 23, 2002, in absentia order. The order was mailed to the address given by the respondent and to which prior notices were mailed and admittedly received by the respondent. The record contains no indication that the in absentia order was returned by the United States Postal Service. Therefore, we find that the respondent should have filed his motion to reopen not later than 180 days from the date the in absentia order was mailed to the respondent, which would be July 23, 2002. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Moreover, even accepting the respondent’s rendition of facts that he only learned of his in absentia order on July 14, 2002, he would have needed to file his motion to reopen 180 days from that date, or January 13, 2003. Consequently, his May 13, 2003, motion was untimely. Although the respondent maintains that he consulted his current counsel on July 18, 2002, there has been no explanation for why a motion was not filed until May 13, 2003. Therefore, even applying the doctrine of equitable tolling, we find the respondent’s motion untimely because he failed to file his motion not later than 180 days from the time he became aware of his in absentia removal order. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, supra (Ninety-day period for filing motion to reopen deportation proceedings would be equitably tolled during time alien was unaware his final order of deportation had become effective).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sergei Shevchenko, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sumeet Lall
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. A final order of removal was entered against the respondent by an Immigration Judge on March 24, 2003. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal without opinion on January 13, 2004. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on June 23, 2004, claiming that an attorney provided ineffective assistance by not filing a brief with the Board prior to our final order. The pending motion to reopen was filed late. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
There is no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9 th Cir.2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002) (acknowledging that party claiming that equitable tolling applies to reopening deadline must show that he acted with reasonable diligence); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(Board will exercise its sua sponte authority over an untimely motion only in an “exceptional situation”). See also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002). Such due diligence is not shown here. Although the respondent claims that he had an agreement with an attorney to file the brief, the respondent appeared pro se before the Board, and our decision was mailed directly to him. The respondent does not say when he consulted with current counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra (in that case, court found that to the extent that equitable tolling applies, based on actions of prior counsel, limitations period begins when respondent meets with new counsel and learns of fraud).
 
In any event, the respondent failed to comply with our procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Siong v. INS, 2004 WL 1637039 (9th Cir. July 23, 2004). Most critically, there is no convincing evidence that the respondent gave the attorney the opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffectiveness. Id. The respondent claims that he “contacted his former attorney to request a statement regarding his failure to submit brief” (Respondent’s Response, at p. 3). This claim is insufficient to indicate that the attorney was informed of the claims made against him. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004)(notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and complaint letter to California State Bar with notation “cc” to opposing counsel does not satisfy the requirement). Consequently, there is no statement or affidavit from counsel, giving his version of events. Id. (citing Matter of Lozada, supra, court said that notice to challenged counsel provides a mechanism by which counsel may respond, giving his version of events, and discouraging baseless allegations).
 
*2 The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank Guerra, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
This case was last before us on February 13, 2004, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for further consideration of her application for suspension of deportation. On March 11, 2004, the respondent timely filed a motion to reconsider. The motion will be granted and the case will be remanded.
 
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (2004); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991) (holding “¿tºhat when we reconsider a decision, we are in effect placing ourselves back in time and considering the case as though a decision in the case on the record before us had never been entered …The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard”). The respondent’s motion states two reasons for reconsideration. The first is that our prior decision is legally defective insofar as it finds that the motion did not demonstrate that the respondent and her children would suffer extreme hardship and that we erred in not considering the likelihood of persecution in India for purposes of hardship (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 3). The second is that due to ineffective assistance of counsel the respondent was prevented from presenting relevant evidence of hardship in her motion to reopen regarding the medical history of her and her eldest son (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 3-5). We agree with the respondent that our prior decision appears to be in error regarding whether her motion to reopen presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate extreme hardship. Accordingly, her motion to reconsider will be granted.
 
Upon reconsideration, we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen presented enough new evidence to establish a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996) (holding that reopening may be had where the new facts alleged, together with the facts already of record, indicate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits, so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues at a hearing). When the respondent filed her motion to reopen, 6 years had passed since the Immigration Judge’s decision and the fact-finding proceeding upon which we based our October 15, 2003, vacatur of the Immigration Judge’s decision for failure to establish extreme hardship.1 The respondent’s motion to reopen explained that her eldest son, Akash, was almost 14 years old, had entered middle school, was becoming accustomed to an American way of life, and could not speak, read or write the official Indian language of Hindi (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-3). In addition, the motion stated that since the Immigration Judge’s decision, Akash’s condition of acute asthma had become severe enough to require hospitalization for almost 1 week (Respondent’s Motion Reopen at 2-3 and Exh. A (letter from Akash)). We find that these facts indicate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits and that we erred in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for failure to demonstrate extreme hardship.
 
*2 We note that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposed the respondent’s motion to reopen on the bases that the respondent failed to depart voluntarily and that the respondent did not demonstrate that her son would not be able to receive suitable healthcare in India (DHS Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 3-5, 8-10). The DHS also argued that the respondent’s motion should be denied on discretionary grounds (DHS Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 5-8). With regards to the voluntary departure issue, we find that the record does not include the oral and written warnings required regarding the consequences of a failure to voluntarily depart. See section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (1994). Thus, the respondent is not barred from having proceedings reopened. Cf. Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996). With regards to the suitable healthcare argument, this is one of the many issues that would more appropriately be developed at a hearing. Finally, with regards to discretion, we find no reason to deny the respondent’s motion on this basis. The DHS’s discretion argument is based on actions and conduct taken by the respondent’s husband; not the respondent. The DHS has not presented any adverse factors against the respondent which would warrant denying her motion in the exercise of discretion.
 
Accordingly, we find that our February 13, 2004, decision, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for failure to demonstrate extreme hardship was in error and that decision will be vacated. Upon reconsideration, we find that the facts alleged by the respondent in her motion to reopen indicate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits, so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues at a hearing. Matter of L-O-G-, supra. On remand, both parties should be given an opportunity to present evidence regarding whether the respondent and her children would suffer extreme hardship if removed to India and any other forms of relief for which the respondent may now be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Our decision dated February 13, 2004, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Vitalia D. Shafer, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on October 31, 2003, at which time we dismissed the respondents’ appeal of the Immigration Judge’s July 29, 2001, decision for failing to timely file a brief or statement in support of the appeal. The respondents have filed a timely motion to reopen on January 29, 2004, alleging ineffective assistance by their former counsel and requesting that this matter be reopened. The Department of Homeland Security (the DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the motion. The Board will deny the motion.
 
The Board has found that certain criteria must be met in order to grant a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the motion must be supported by an affidavit of the respondents setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the motion must reflect whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The documentary evidence presented by the respondents meets the requirements set forth in Lozada.
 
While the respondents have complied with the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arose, has held that, in addition to meeting the procedural requirements, an alien must also show prejudice. Although there is a rebuttable presumption of prejudice where alien’s counsel fails to file an appeal brief, any such presumption of prejudice is rebutted where the alien fails to show that an appeal brief could have changed the outcome of the appeal proceedings before the Board. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 371 F.3d 771 (11th Cir. 2004).
 
The Board finds that the respondents’ allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are unpersuasive. While the respondents argue that there was ineffective assistance of counsel because their previous counsel failed to submit properly translated evidence of the risk to the medical profession in Columbia, the respondents do not suggest that the document could have affected the Immigration Judge’s decision, particularly in light of the Immigration Judge’s comprehensive analysis of the objective reports of country conditions. Moreover, the respondents have not indicated what arguments they would have presented on appeal that could have changed the outcome of the appeal proceedings before the Board. Accordingly, as the respondents were not shown to have experienced actual prejudice, either during the course of the proceeding before the Immigration Judge or by the previous counsel’s failure to file an appeal brief, there can be no ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 The respondents’ motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion for reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dani Lisa Page
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents filed a motion to reopen on June 22, 2004. We dismissed the respondents’ appeal on December 9, 2002. The motion has been filed out of time and will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion.
 
The respondents claim in their motion that prior counsel, who has been suspended from the Colorado bar, was incompetent, because he failed to file a brief with this Board, which caused us to dismiss the appeal for failure to file a brief. There is, however, no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here.
 
Equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. See Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (10th Cir. 2002). The pending motion was filed over a year late. The respondents claim that they were unaware of former counsel’s ineffective assistance until they consulted with the attorney who signed the pending motion, but failed to enter his appearance with the Board. Yet the attorney who signed the pending motion began representing the respondents on October 15, 2003, according to a letter he wrote to the Colorado Supreme Court Attorney Regulation Counsel. Even so, this motion was not submitted for 8 more months. As Riley v. INS, supra, at 1258, requires, we have considered that the respondents have complied with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, the respondents have not shown due diligence in presenting their claims in the pending motion, where the motion was not filed for many months after new counsel was consulted. Riley v. INS, supra, at 1258. The respondents state that they did not become aware of former counsel’s ineffective assistance of counsel until current counsel “received a copy of the administrative record” (Respondents’ Mot., at p. 12). However, the respondents do not state when this occurred. Exhibits submitted with the motion indicate that counsel who signed the pending motion submitted a brief to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 6, 2004, after receiving the administrative record. Id.; Respondent’s Mot. at Exh. 4. The pending motion was not filed for another four months. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nassim Arzani, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy Nguyen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
This matter was last before the Board on November 20, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our August 20, 2002, decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent has now filed a second motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The motion seeks reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent, a native and citizen of Jordan who is married to a United States citizen, wishes to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. In the alternative, the respondent requests reinstatement of the voluntary departure period granted by the Immigration Judge at the respondent’s hearing on July 11, 2001. The Department of Homeland Security (the DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, an alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and the motion must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The instant motion, filed on July 9, 2004, represents the respondent’s second attempt to reopen his proceedings. It was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. The respondent requests that the filing deadline be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his appeal before the Board. The respondent states in an affidavit that he never received the Board’s decision regarding his appeal, and therefore did not know that he needed to leave the United States within 30 days of the date of the order, which was issued May 6, 2002, in order to comply with the terms of his voluntary departure. See generally section 240B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. Rather, the respondent claims that he remained in the United States on the advice of his attorney, applied for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, and was detained by the DHS at his adjustment interview on June 21, 2004.
 
The doctrine of equitable tolling may, in certain circumstances, override the rules regarding motions to reopen in cases where the respondent has been defrauded by an individual purporting to provide legal representation. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1224 (9th Cir. 2002). In order to receive the benefit of equitable tolling, a respondent who alleges ineffective assistance must first comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion to reopen should be supported by an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, including a statement setting forth the details of the agreement that was entered into with former counsel. See id. at 639. The respondent should also notify former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance so that he or she may respond, and, if the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities on the part of former counsel, the respondent should file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Id. In this case, the motion is supported by an affidavit from the respondent, a short declaration from the respondent’s former counsel stating that he never received a decision from the Board regarding the respondent’s case, and a complaint form for the State Bar of California that had not yet been submitted when the motion was filed (Respondent’s Exhs. B, C, H). We find that the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada. See Rodriguez-Lariz, supra, at 1226-27 (stating that the factors are not rigidly applied).
 
*2 We do not, however, find that the evidence of record supports the respondent’s allegation that neither he nor his former attorney received notice of the Board’s decision regarding his appeal. Our order summarily affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge was issued May 6, 2002. The respondent’s former counsel submitted the fast motion to reopen shortly thereafter, on June 3, 2002. The Board denied the motion to reopen on August 20, 2002. The respondent, through former counsel, then filed a motion to reconsider on November 20, 2003. The Board considered the merits of the motion despite its untimeliness. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Finding no factual or legal error in the prior order, the Board denied the motion to reconsider on March 24, 2004. The instant motion asserts that the respondent knew nothing of the Board’s decisions regarding his case. Given the lengthy procedural history above, this assertion simply is not credible. It stands to reason that the attorney received notice of the Board’s decision regarding the respondent’s appeal because he otherwise would not have known to file the motion to reopen. It is also reasonable to assume the attorney consulted with his client regarding the decision, as the motion would have required more work by the attorney for which he presumably would have been compensated. Moreover, the respondent has not sufficiently rebutted the presumption of effective mail service. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Under section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c), service by mail is sufficient if there is proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien. We therefore cannot give credence to the respondent’s assertion that he did not know he needed to depart the United States, and we conclude that his case does not merit equitable tolling.
 
We further note that the respondent’s request for remand to the Immigration Judge for consideration of his application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act is not appropriate because the respondent is an arriving alien; therefore, jurisdiction over the application lies not with the Immigration Judge, but with the DHS. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1). We are also unable to grant the respondent’s request to reinstate the voluntary departure period. The Board does not have authority to reinstate voluntary departure in this instance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.29(h) (requiring removal proceedings to be reopened for purpose other than solely making application for voluntary departure). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James J. Orlow, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The instant motion is untimely and number-barred and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on November 26, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), only one motion to reopen may be filed and in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before February 24, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until April 14, 2004, more than a year late. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
Counsel for the respondent urges that we reopen proceedings in the exercise of our sua sponte reopening authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We will not do so. New counsel for the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by prior counsel in failing to point out that the charging document (Order to Show Cause, Form I-221) contained the incorrect ground of deportability. The Form I-221 states that on November 17, 1986, the respondent entered the United States without inspection under section 241(a)(1)(B) of the INA (1995). However, new counsel has pointed out that the respondent on November 17, 1986, entered the United States with an F-1 nonimmigrant student visa, as indicated by the stamp in his passport and the confirmation by official records. Thus, it appears that the proper ground of deportability would have been as a visa overstay, under section 241(a)(1)(C) of the INA (1995). However, counsel has failed to establish that the respondent was not deportable when the Immigration Judge issued the in absentia order of deportation in this case on September 5, 1996.
 
The respondent has failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 U&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, he has failed to show prejudice in his case. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003). The respondent has failed to show that he was not deportable. The respondent has failed to show that reopening would be warranted in this case. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (alien failed to show substantial likelihood that the result in the case would be changed if proceedings were reopened); see generally Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996). The respondent hired several attorneys over the 17 years he has been in the United States and the 8 years he has been in immigration proceedings, yet he has failed to adjust his status or depart the United States. The respondent has failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claims to relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kai W. De Graaf, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James D. Paoli
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent’s motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on September 1, 1992. More than 11 years later, on July 30, 2004, the respondent has filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Contrary to the respondent’s argument, Respondent’s Mot., at pp. 18-19, the time limitation does apply to his case. The time limitations on motions was added to the regulations on July 1, 1996. See 61 FR 18900-01 (July 1, 1996). For cases, like the respondent’s, that already had a final administrative decision on that date, the new regulations allowed until September 30, 1996, for any motion to reopen to be filed. The pending motion was therefore filed over 7 years late. We note that in arguing that his motion should be considered, the respondent cites to regulations applicable to in absentia decisions (Respondent’s Mot., at pp. 20-21). As the respondent’s case was not held in absentia, these references are inapplicable to the respondent’s case.
 
Underlying the motion is a claim of ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former attorney, who has been suspended from the practice of law in New York. The respondent claims that former counsel provided ineffective assistance before the Immigration Judge. The respondent also claims that he was unaware that former counsel had filed an appeal with the Board, or that this appeal was resolved in 1992. However, we cannot excuse the lateness of the motion in this case. In Iavorski v. INS, 124, 127, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000), the court suggested that the filing deadline for motions with the Board may be tolled based on deceptive actions of counsel. However, such tolling is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. See Tho Dinh Tran v. Alphonse Hotel Corp., 281 F.3d 23, 36-37 (2d Cir. 2002); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(Board will exercise its sua sponte authority over an untimely motion only in an “exceptional situation”). Here, the respondent fails to establish he exercised diligence in pursuing his rights. The respondent states that former counsel told him he would “take care of it” after the Immigration Judge issued an order of deportation in 1987. However, the respondent’s affidavit is vague as to what steps he took in the 17-year period preceding the filing of this motion, to find out about the status of the deportation order against him. The respondent suggests that he contacted former counsel, but was either told that the case was ongoing, or was unable to speak to former counsel (Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶¶ 10, 12). The respondent’s affidavit suggests that he made no effort after 1996 to learn of the status of his case. Id. at 12. This does not evidence that the respondent exercised diligence in learning about the status of the deportation order pending against him. As the DHS aptly argues, “… this respondent completely ignored the ramification of his prior hearing for 17 years.… The respondent repeatedly claims that he was unable to get in touch with his prior attorney, but never explains why he waited 17 years to procure new counsel to follow up on his case.” See Iavorski v. INS, supra, at 134 (when respondent unable to reach his attorney to inquire about his case, he should have known that ineffective assistance of counsel had occurred and taken action earlier). Given the respondent’s lack of diligence, there is no basis for tolling of the motions deadline, and the motion is therefore denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Curley, Kathleen M.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 27, 2003. The respondent submitted a timely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and a claim for relief from removal based on a visa petition filed by his mother and a pending visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. The Immigration Judge did not render a decision on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He found that the visa petition filed by the respondent’s mother was no longer pending, and that reopening was not warranted on that basis. He determined that the respondent failed to demonstrate the bona fides of his marriage to establish that he is eligible for relief based on the pending visa petition filed by his wife. We note that the respondent’s marriage to his United States citizen wife took place 4 years before the initiation of removal proceedings. There is no requirement to demonstrate the bona fides of that marriage to support the visa petition. We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and his claim of eligibility for relief based on the pending visa petition filed by his wife. Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ilyce Shugall, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Larry J. Gallagher
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Suspension of deportation; fair hearing
 
The respondents now appeal from an Immigration Judge’s June 6, 2003, decision denying their requests for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, & U.S.C. § 1254(a), and from the Immigration Judge’s July 2, 2003, decision denying their motion to reconsider that decision. For the reasons set forth in the Immigration Judge’s decisions, we will adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondents’ requests for suspension of deportation. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
On appeal, the respondents reiterate the arguments put forth during the deportation bearings and in the motion to reconsider. It is undisputed, however, that the respondent Serafin Campos-Soria (AXX XXX XXX) entered the United States on September 1, 1992, and was served with an Order to Show Cause on June 14, 1994. It is further undisputed that the respondent Rosa Cuamba Rodriguez (AXX XXX XXX) entered the United States on October 1, 1992, and was served with an Order to Show Cause May 14, 1994. We find, therefore, that the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the respondents are ineligible for relief under section 244(a) of the Act because they failed to establish that they had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 7 years immediately preceding the issuance of the Orders to Show Cause. See section 244(a)(1) of the Act. See also Matter of Nolasco, 22 I&N Dec. 632, 641 (BIA 1999) (discussing the application of the “stop-time” rule under section 309(c)(5) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the “IIRIRA”). We emphasize that the Immigration Judge appropriately applied the law as it existed on the hearing date, and rendered the correct decision. Compare, Guadalupe-Cruz v. INS, 240 F.3d 1209, opinion corrected by 250 F.3d 1271 (9th Cir. 2001). In addition, if the respondents had succeeded in advancing this hearing to a date prior to April 1, 1997, they would not have accrued the necessary continuous physical presence by that date.
 
*2 While their appeal remained pending before the Board, the respondent filed a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. They specifically allege that their former attorney failed to act with due diligence to proceed with the hearings prior to the April 1, 1997, effective date for section 309 of the IIRIRA, thus precluding their eligibility for suspension of deportation. Although we find that the respondents have complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), we cannot find that they suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s conduct. Even if the attorney had filed the applications for suspension of deportation on behalf of the respondents prior April 1, 1997, the respondents would not have accrued the requisite 7 years of continuous physical presence required under section 244(a)(1) of the Act at that time. See, generally, Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); cf. Guadalupe-Cruz v. INS, 240 F.3d 1209 (9th Cir. 2001). We will deny the motion.
 
In sum, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s findings and conclusion, and we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Inasmuch as the dispositive facts of this case are undisputed, and the respondents suffered no prejudice as a result of their former attorney’s handling of the case, we reject the respondent’s contentions with regard to the fairness of the proceedings. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and in accordance with our decision in Matter of Chouliaris, 16 I&N Dec. 168 (BIA 1977), the respondents are permitted to depart from the United States voluntarily within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director; and in the event of failure so to depart, the respondents shall be deported as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard VanVeldhuisen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents1 filed a motion to reopen on April 23, 2004. We dismissed the respondents’ appeal on March 21, 2003. The motion has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondents claim in their motion that prior counsel was incompetent, because prior counsel failed to inform them of the Board’s prior decision so they could file a timely motion to reopen. There is, however, no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. Any equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 127, 134-35. (2nd Cir. 2000). The pending motion was filed almost a year late. The respondents do not say when they learned of the Board’s prior order, and therefore fail to establish that the motion could not have been filed earlier.
 
In any event, for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). The respondents have not satisfied these requirements. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

The pending motion was filed by a family. We note that Nubyra Zahid Chowdhury, A 73 566 600, was included in the motion. However, she is represented by counsel and filed an earlier, separate motion to reopen, which will be addressed in a separate order. To the extent that Nubyra Zahid Chowdhury, A 73 566 600, wishes to be included in this order, this motion as to her would be numerically barred as well as untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander J. Segal, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from a May 14, 2004, decision by the Immigration Judge to deny his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. The motion was denied as untimely. The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel, who failed to file an appeal with this Board after the respondent was ordered deported, and that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the motion was untimely. A motion to reopen before an Immigration Judge must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The respondent was ordered deported on November 29, 1996, but did not file a motion to reopen until April 23, 2004, after being detained by the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). Moreover, the respondent’s motion did not conform with the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Such motions must be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts, including a statement setting forth the details of the agreement that was entered into with former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. The respondent should also notify former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance so that he or she may respond, and, if the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities on the part of former counsel, the respondent should file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, Id. In this case, the motion to reopen submitted to the Immigration Judge included only an affidavit by the respondent and correspondence from the respondent’s former attorney regarding his appeal, which is insufficient. We note that on appeal the respondent has attached new evidence that he filed a complaint with the Departmental Disciplinary Committee in New York and sent correspondence of some kind to his former attorney; however, it appears that the mailings occurred after the Immigration Judge ruled on the respondent’s motion (Respondent’s Exhs. A-C). We note that the Board does not consider new evidence on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
*2 Finally, we conclude that the respondent is not eligible for equitable tolling. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the circuit in which in this matter arises, has not addressed the issue of whether the filing deadline for a motion to reopen may be equitably tolled. The respondent correctly notes that other circuit courts of appeals have applied the doctrine of equitable tolling to the regulatory time limitation for motions to reopen and have treated actions by the agent of a party as the proper subject of equitable tolling in favor of that same party. See, e.g., Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). In order to receive the benefit of equitable tolling, however, an alien must demonstrate not only that his constitutional right to due process was violated by the conduct of counsel, but also that he has exercised due diligence during the period he wishes to toll. See Iavorski v. INS, supra, at 135. While we understand that the respondent’s former counsel allegedly failed to file a Notice of Appeal with the Board after the respondent was ordered deported in 1996, the respondent has not adequately explained why he waited over 7 years to file his motion to reopen. Because the respondent has failed to demonstrate due diligence in pursuing his claim, we do not find that his case warrants equitable tolling. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Juan A. Laguna, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondents move the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated November 24, 2003. The respondents request that we apply the principle of equitable tolling and consider their motion despite the fact that it was filed more than 90 days after our final removal order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999) (concluding that the statute of limitations for reopening order of deportation should be tolled when alien has been the victim of fraud). Even assuming that the motion was timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling, the respondents have failed to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), wherein we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The respondent has not contacted former counsel, informed him of the allegations leveled against him, and given him an opportunity to respond. In Matter of Lozada, at 639, we stated that “before allegations of ineffectiveness are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion” (emphasis added). We noted that the high standard which we enunciated was necessary if the Board is to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before us. Id. It is crucial that former counsel be given “the opportunity to respond to the allegation¿sº of ineffectiveness,” due to the charges made by the respondent. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004)(notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and complaint letter to California State Bar with notation “cc” to opposing counsel does not satisfy the requirement). For example, in the male respondent’s affidavit he writes that he indicated to the immigration consultant that his son Omar was under medical supervision because of renal problems, but his son’s condition was never addressed during the hearing. The respondent maintains that he emphasized this fact on several occasions. However, when the male respondent testified during the removal hearing he indicated that Omar was in good health (Tr. at 15). While the respondents have raised this issue in their ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we have no statement or affidavit from counsel, giving his version of events and thus no way to assess the validity of the claim. See also Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 3369 (3rd Cir. 2003) (A requirement of Lozada includes filing a motion and giving the allegedly ineffective counsel an opportunity to respond). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, see Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002) (Lozada “factors are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance”). However, in this case the need for notification and response from former counsel is critical to our meaningful assessment of this claim. Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: ISHTIAQ HUSSAIN
File: AXX XX0 244 - San Francisco

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Resendez Guajardo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Katherine Zill
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On June 9, 2004, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s May 10, 2004, decision finding that he had waived his right to appeal. The respondent contends that this Board erroneously found that he had made no argument on appeal that his waiver of appeal was not knowing and intelligent as he raised this specific argument in his Notice of Appeal. The respondent also contends that he was deprived of the right to file a brief on appeal as he was not provided with a transcript of the proceedings. Furthermore, the respondent avers that the Immigration Judge erred in not informing him that he might be eligible for relief in the form of asylum (Motion at 4-5).
 
When deciding a motion to reconsider, the Board considers the case as though the decision in the case on the record before us had never been entered. If the applicant was eligible for relief at the time of the original decision, then in reconsidering the decision, we treat his status as that which it had been at the time of the initial decision. “The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991).
 
The respondent correctly notes that the Board erred in stating that he had not contended that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent. However, the Board correctly noted that the respondent was represented by counsel when he elected to waive appeal, contrary to his contentions otherwise (Tr. at 5). We find no merit to the respondent’s argument that he had not retained the attorney and that the record does not indicate whether she had been “fully familiar” with his case (Reply to DHS Opposition). When he waived appeal, the respondent appeared with the same counsel who had represented him at the prior hearing. The fact that the respondent contracted for services with another attorney who then utilized the representative who ultimately appeared on his behalf is not relevant to our inquiry. It is the respondent’s prerogative whom he chooses to serve as his representative, if any. The representative at issue submitted a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney on behalf of the respondent, which the respondent never contested, and appeared twice on his behalf (Tr. at 1, 5). At no time during the proceedings below did the respondent indicate that this woman was not his representative. As such, the record corroborates the Board’s finding that the respondent appeared with counsel, through whom he waived appeal (Tr. at 5-6). Given these facts, the Board did not err in finding that the respondent had waived appeal. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000). Moreover, while the respondent suggests that his counsel was not adequately prepared, he has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 We find no merit to the respondent’s argument that he was “denied” the right to file a brief because he was not provided with a transcript of the proceedings (Motion at 3). The Board does not normally prepare a transcript when a party has waived appeal as the Immigration Judge’s decision is final. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). While the respondent also asserts error in that he was not afforded an interpreter, we note that he informed the Immigration Judge that he speaks English (Tr. at 2). Moreover, the respondent’s counsel indicated that she had conferred with him before waiving appeal on his behalf (Tr. at 5). Again, if the respondent seeks to assert that his counsel took action contrary to their agreement or that she, in fact, had not adequately conferred with him, he has not met the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Finally, we find no merit to the respondent’s allegation that the Immigration Judge erred in not noting that as a particular political party was no longer in power that “there was an inference that ¿the respondentº may fear returning” to his native Pakistan (Motion at 5). This argument is highly attenuated. An Immigration Judge is under no obligation to present a respondent’s claim on his behalf, particularly where, as here, a respondent is represented. The respondent through counsel informed the Immigration Judge that he was not seeking any relief, and he wished to have an order entered for his return to Pakistan (Tr. at 5). As such, there was no “inference” that could be drawn that the respondent feared harm if removed from the United States. In sum, we find no basis upon which reopening is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary Silbiger, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(l)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is an unmarried male native and citizen of Lebanon. In a decision dated March 30, 1999, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and granted him the privilege of voluntary departure. The respondent filed a timely appeal. The Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on September 24, 2002, and granted the respondent 30 days in which to voluntarily depart. The respondent filed a petition for review of that decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On March 17, 2004, the Ninth Circuit dismissed his petition for review of the Board’s September 24, 2002, dismissal of his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. A petition for rehearing was denied by the Ninth Circuit on July 12, 2004.
 
While the respondent’s petition for review was pending, he filed, on December 23, 2002, a timely motion to reopen based upon counsel’s assertion that the respondent was gathering additional evidence regarding the exceptional and extremely unusual requirement for his previously denied cancellation of removal application. The Board denied the motion on July 30, 2003, for failure to support the motion with an affidavit or other evidentiary material as required by regulation.
 
On August 29, 2003, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen and reconsider in which he alleged that he had additional new and material evidence regarding his eligibility for cancellation of removal. On October 27, 2003, the Board denied the motion to reconsider for failure to allege any factual or legal error in the Board’s prior decision as required for reconsideration and denied the motion to reopen for again failing to support the motion with evidence as required by regulation and also for exceeding the numerical limitations for motions to reopen as dictated by regulation.
 
On August 9, 2004, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen in which he seeks to have an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, based upon an approved visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen mother and to again apply for cancellation of removal based upon his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Barry Fagan, the attorney who represented him at his removal hearing.1 On August 11, 2004, the respondent filed a supplement to his motion to reopen in which he raised arguments regarding his voluntary departure period and the tolling of motions to reopen based upon claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. On August 12, 2004, the respondent filed, via facsimile transmission, a second supplement to his motion to reopen in which he provided his application for adjustment of status — one of the forms of relief sought in his August 9, 2004, motion — as well as an addendum and a supplement to that application. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the respondent’s three filings regarding his most recent motion to reopen. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 We first address that portion of the respondent’s motion that deals with his request for reopening so that he can apply for adjustment of status. In order to have proceedings reopened so that he can apply for adjustment of status, the respondent must show that the motion is timely filed, he has a visa immediately available to him, that he is not statutorily barred for failing to voluntarily depart within 30 days of the Board’s September 24, 2002, decision, and that he is not otherwise barred or ineligible for adjustment of status. The respondent currently has a visa immediately available to him due to his mother’s naturalization on January 30, 2004, and the resulting conversion of his second preference visa to a first preference visa.2 See Dep’t. of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. VIII, No. 72 (Aug. 2004). The respondent contends that his voluntary departure period, as calculated under Ninth Circuit law, expires on August 18, 2004.3 Under Ninth Circuit law, the respondent is thus not statutorily barred by section 240(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), from having proceedings reopened where he did not depart the United States within 30 days of the Board’s September 24, 2002, order.
 
However, the respondent is barred by the time and numerical limitations in the motions regulation from having proceedings reopened because he is seeking reopening in order to apply for adjustment of status in his third motion to reopen which was filed well after the expiration of the 90-day period for the timely filing of motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion, as it relates to his request for adjustment of status, does not fall within any of the exceptions to the time and numerical bars for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The respondent states that the motion should be granted, even though it is untimely and his third motion, because he is now eligible for adjustment of status and is claiming that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel. As the respondent did not become eligible to apply for adjustment of status until his mother became a naturalized United States citizen on January 30, 2004, he cannot claim that any alleged ineffectiveness of the attorney who represented him only at his removal hearings, which ended on March 30, 1999, affected his ability to timely file a motion to reopen for adjustment of status within 90 days of the Board’s September 24, 2002, decision. Moreover, it is present counsel’s filing of two previous, and clearly defective, motions to reopen that subjects the respondent to the numerical bars regarding the instant motion to reopen. The respondent does not cite to any exception to the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen which are based upon eligibility for adjustment of status and we find none in the regulations. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen for adjustment of status must be denied.
 
*3 We next turn to that portion of the respondent’s motion that seeks reopening so that he can again apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. The respondent contends that he has new evidence showing that he met the continuous physical presence requirement and cites to a variety of documents which he provides as exhibits D-G with his motion. The respondent, however, fails to explain how his 1983-1984 high school records, college records for 1986-1988, bank letter attesting to an account opened in October of 1987 to the October 16, 1997, date of the letter, and social security records showing employment earnings for 1985-1986 and 1989-2002, constitutes new or previously unavailable or undiscoverable evidence that could not have been presented at his March 30, 1999, hearing. Nor has the respondent demonstrated how this evidence could not have been presented with either of his first two motions to reopen. The respondent also asserts that he has new evidence that his mother would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he is deported. He points to the death of his father, his mother’s subsequent diagnosis of depression, and her continued health problems for which she needs assistance. Counsel’s statements that the respondent’s brother and sister cannot provide their mother with the emotional and economic assistance that is provided by the respondent is insufficient to show that proceedings should be reopened on this basis. Furthermore, the respondent does not explain why his mother, a United States citizen, cannot obtain local, state, or federal assistance for the elderly or disabled or why such aid could not be used in conjunction with any aid provided by the respondent’s brother, who lives with the respondent and their mother, and by the respondent’s sister, who lives within 1 hour of their mother.
 
The crux of the respondent’s present motion is his allegation that he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney and thus should have proceedings reopened. The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel in that former counsel did not meet with him sufficiently to be aware of the relevant facts of the case, did not obtain the documentation needed to meet the eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal, did not interview and present crucial witnesses, and did not request an interpreter for the respondent’s lawful permanent resident father, who attempted to testify on his son’s behalf at the hearing. He asserts that his former counsel’s actions fell well below the standard of competency.
 
The respondent has not fully complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as there is no copy of any agreement regarding his representation by former counsel and it is unclear from the document submitted by the respondent whether he filed a complaint with a state bar, and if so, which state bar. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The “complaint,” which he submitted as exhibit Q to his motion, consists of 1-page of an apparently multi-page document which is unaccompanied by any attachments showing to which state bar the complaint was made. Nor does the respondent provide any evidence showing that the “complaint” was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. In addition, the letter from present counsel informing former counsel of the complaint lodged against him is dated August 4, 2004, only 4 days before the motion was sent to the Board by overnight courier. See Resp. Mot. at Exh. S. Thus, former counsel was not given a meaningful opportunity to respond to the complaint.4 Without former counsel’s statement as to how he prepared for the respondent’s hearing or how often he met with the respondent, we have an incomplete and one-sided version of the events that transpired. Moreover, the respondent fails to explain why he waited until less than 2 weeks before his voluntary departure date to file the instant motions and supplements thus depriving former counsel and the DHS from having a meaningful opportunity to respond to his numerous arguments.
 
*4 Furthermore, even if we were to find that the respondent has met this first hurdle of establishing substantial compliance with Lozada, we do not find that the respondent’s situation falls within the Ninth Circuit’s equitable tolling policy for aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit has stated that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 897. See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, supra, and cases cited therein. The facts of this case show that all of the alleged ineffectiveness of former counsel could have, and should have, been known prior to the issuance of the Board’s decision on September 24, 2002. Present counsel has been representing the respondent since the filing of the Notice of Appeal on April 27, 1999. Thus, present counsel received a copy of the Immigration Judge’s decision and the transcript of proceedings. The respondent and present counsel were therefore well aware of what evidence was, and was not, submitted to the Immigration Judge as well as what witnesses were, and were not, available to testify on the respondent’s behalf. Even applying equitable tolling to his case, the clock began running at the latest on September 24, 2002, when the Board dismissed his appeal. However, the respondent did not file this motion to reopen until August 9, 2004, almost 2 years after our decision dismissing his appeal and almost 5 months after the Ninth Circuit denied his petition for review of that dismissal. Counsel chose to limit his arguments on appeal to the Board on the Immigration Judge’s alleged failure to order an interpreter and on the Immigration Judge’s alleged error in finding that the respondent’s evidence was insufficient to meet the continuous physical presence and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship requirements. This was a tactical decision by counsel who then chose to wait until the respondent’s request for rehearing on the denial of his petition for review was denied by the Ninth Circuit before filing the instant motion to reopen. The respondent could have filed a timely motion to remand during the pendency of his appeal or a timely motion to reopen setting forth the facts of his case but did not do so. We do not find that the respondent acted diligently in this case.
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Footnotes

1

The respondent has been represented by present counsel since the filing of his Notice of Appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 30, 1999, decision.

2

The respondent’s approved visa petition, with a priority date of April 3, 1996, was filed on his behalf by his mother who was, at the time of the filing of the petition, a lawful permanent resident. The respondent’s mother became a naturalized United States citizen on January 30, 2004. Her naturalization automatically converted his approved petition from a second preference (2B) family petition to a first preference family petition. The respondent would not be eligible for a second preference (2B) visa at this time because visas are available only for petitions with priority dates of July 1, 1995, or early. See Dep’t. of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. VIII, No. 72 (Aug. 2004).

3

We assume for purposes of this decision that the respondent’s calculation of an August 18, 2004, departure date is correct but have not evaluated the merits of that argument.

4

We also note that the DHS has 13 days in which to respond to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent’s actions in filing two separate supplements to his motion on August 11th and 12th, when coupled with his request that we issue a decision prior to the August 18, 2004, expiration of his voluntary departure period, ensures that the DHS cannot have the full 13-day period to respond to the motion and its supplements.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM: The appeal is dismissed. The summary of the Immigration Judge’s oral decision, dated October 28, 2003, noted that the Immigration Judge granted the respondent 4 months voluntary departure. We also note that in the transcript of proceedings, the respondent, represented by counsel, agreed to 4 month period of voluntary departure. One of the regulatory conditions for being granted 120 days voluntary departure in removal proceedings is that the alien “waives appeal of all issues ….” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). On November 24, 2003, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). Upon review, we find that this case is not properly before us. The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The respondent has argued that the decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and intelligent one, because, although his attorney discussed it with him, he did not understand it. Absent valid assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel, per Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we are forced to conclude that the respondent, having selected his attorney, is bound by his attorney’s actions, especially where he has discussed them with the respondent. Accordingly, as there is nothing now pending before the Board,
 
IT IS ORDERED that the record be returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Scop, Jonathan, Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 05, 2003. We have reviewed the record and we agree that the respondent does not qualify for cancellation of removal because he failed to demonstrate that his United States citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship as a result of his return to Mexico. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(D); Matter of Andazola, 23 I&N Dec. 319 (BIA 2002); Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 63 (2001). We do not find that the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance was improper when the respondent’s case had been pending for 5 months and the respondent’s attorney failed to provide an adequate explanation for his absence at the scheduled hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987)(the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. We will not grant remand on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, as we are not persuaded that the respondent would have prevailed in this matter but for the allegedly ineffective representation of former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has presented no arguments which persuade us that this decision should be disturbed. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a female native and citizen of India. This case was last before us on July 20, 1998, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our denial of her appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen. In our July 20, 1998, decision, we found that the respondent failed to establish that she was eligible for adjustment of status as she failed to provide a copy of the Approval Notice of the visa petition filed on her behalf. We pointed out that the document attached to her motion to reopen, which the respondent alleged was an Approval Notice of the visa petition, was in fact an Approval Notice of an application for voluntary departure under the Family Unity Program. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reconsider was denied.
 
On April 6, 2004, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen in which she alleges ineffective assistance of counsel and in which she again seeks to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent’s motion to reopen must be denied as both untimely filed and number-barred, as it does not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions to the time and number restrictions on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of the Board’s decision and parties are limited to one motion to reopen). We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which jurisdiction the instant case arises, recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). We find that equitable tolling has not been shown to be applicable in this case as the respondent has not shown that she acted with due diligence after we explicitly enumerated the error at issue in our July 20, 1998, decision. The respondent did not file a motion to reopen until almost 6 years after we issued that decision, and she has not established or claimed that she was unaware of the fact that her last motion had been denied in 1998.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: JORGE HERNANDEZ-CORTEZ
File: AXX XX8 444 - Los Angeles
August 13, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Z. Sandoval, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica M. Little
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s June 16, 2003, decision pretermitting his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), on grounds of abandonment. During the pendency of the appeal, moreover, the respondent filed a motion to remand in which he asserts that his failure to file his cancellation of removal application was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
It is not disputed that the respondent failed to file his application for cancellation of removal by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge, nor is there any doubt as to whether the respondent was given adequate notice of that deadline. The Immigration Judge has explicit regulatory authority to set a deadline for the filing of applications for relief, and an applicant’s failure to abide by that deadline constitutes an abandonment of the application. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (2003). Because the respondent received ample notice of the filing deadline and was given sufficient time to complete his application, we agree with the Immigration Judge that he did not show good cause for a continuance. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Therefore, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
In his motion to remand, the respondent contends that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to timely file his application for cancellation of removal. However, the respondent’s motion does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and fails to persuade us that his failure to file the application in a timely manner was due to former counsel’s ineffectiveness. Among other things, Matter of Lozada requires that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel submit an affidavit specifying the nature and scope of former counsel’s representation and either file a complaint against the allegedly-ineffective attorney or provide an adequate explanation for failing to file such a complaint. In this instance the respondent has submitted a sworn declaration in which he states that the precise scope of former counsel’s representation was “never clear” to him and that he was not filing a bar complaint against his former attorney because “¿iºt was not clearly define ¿sicº if ¿former counselº was going to work on the merits of the Immigration matter…” (R’s Motion to Remand, Exh. C). For the reasons stated in Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996), we find the respondent’s explanation for his failure to file a bar complaint against former counsel to be inadequate. Unanswered questions remain regarding the nature of the attorney-client relationship, and the respondent’s failure to file a bar complaint both aggravates these questions and leaves open the possibility of collusion between the respondent and former counsel. Absent the respondent’s full compliance with the Lozada requirements, the degree of confidence we have in his ineffective assistance of counsel claim is lessened to the point where we decline to grant the motion.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent is ultimately responsible to be his own advocate in removal proceedings, and if he was in doubt as to whether former counsel’s representation extended to the handling of his immigration case (which would include the filing of his cancellation of removal application), then he was under an obligation either to obtain clarification on that matter prior to his filing deadlines or to file the application himself as an act of prudence. Instead, he simply let matters rest and allowed his deadlines to pass without action. Thus, the respondent’s failure to file the application in a timely manner was necessarily caused at least as much by his own lack of diligence as by former counsel’s ineffective assistance.
 
The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge Guttlein, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David Burke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening, termination
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on October 9, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings for lack of jurisdiction. The respondent has now filed another motion to reopen and to terminate the proceedings, again contending that a new charging instrument should be issued, as well as alleging that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on an approved immediate relative visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. The respondent’s motion is dismissed, as moot.
 
The record reflects the respondent departed the United States to Canada, and was detained and arrested by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) upon his attempted re-entry to the United States. By voluntarily departing the United States to Canada in June 2002, the respondent executed the Immigration Judge’s outstanding order of deportation. Further, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) specifically prohibits our consideration of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, after the respondent departs from the United States. Consequently, in rendering our October 9, 2003, decision, the Board concluded we had no jurisdiction to consider his request and denied the respondent’s motion, as moot. See Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864 (BIA 1994) (the Board has no jurisdiction over an alien’s motion to reconsider an order of deportation after the order has been executed, and the alien has been deported from the United States.)
 
We decline to revisit issues that were raised, addressed, and resolved in our previous order. Furthermore, as noted by counsel, several motions alleging the ineffective assistance of counsel have been filed, considered, and denied, in this case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting out the requirements that would support a motion to reopen based on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel). Moreover, as urged by the DHS in its opposition to the respondent’s motion, ineffective assistance of counsel is not the proximate cause for the respondent’s inability to have his case reopened. It is the respondent’s departure from the United States that renders the respondent ineligible for reopening. The respondent cannot excuse the execution of his order of deportation on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), an alien who attempts to illegally re-enter the United States after having voluntarily left the United States, thereby executing the Immigration Judge’s outstanding order of deportation, is subject to the reinstatement of the prior order of deportation, which is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, and may not apply for any relief under the Act, and shall be removed under the prior order.
 
*2 The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has reached the same conclusion that executed orders of deportation underlying a reinstatement order are not subject to review. In Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir. 2002), the Court found that “section 241(a)(5) ¿of the Actº limits that review to the reinstatement order itself; ¿and that theº court cannot ‘reopen or review’ the merits of the ¿underlyingº deportation order.”
 
Therefore, we are without jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion. Accordingly, the record shall be returned to the Immigration Judge without further action.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Judge without further action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kevin Armstrong,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). We find that the respondent has failed to establish his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as he has neither shown he was prejudiced by establishing that he is eligible for relief nor complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We are without authority to review the decision of the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) to institute removal proceedings and proceed with the hearing which the respondent claims resulted in a violation of his right to the equal protection under the laws. See Matter of U-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 327, 333 (BIA 1991). Finally, we will reinstate the respondent’s voluntary departure order despite the request by the DHS to vacate the order, as it appears to us that the respondent, having posted the required bond, intends to comply with the voluntary departure order. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

IN RE: NUNES, RICARDO EMANUEL
File: AXX XX0 764 - Newark
August 9, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reconsider our decision dated May 13, 2004. Applicable regulations provide that motions to reopen removal proceedings “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.…” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is eligible as a matter of law for the relief sought upon reopening. Matter of Rodriguez-Vera, 17 & N Dec. 105 (BIA 1979). A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).
 
The respondent’s instant motion is based on (1) our failure to grant his timely-filed motion for an extension in the briefing schedule on his appeal, and (2) a claim that ineffective assistance of counsel in the underlying criminal proceedings led to the imposition of a one-year sentence on a probation violation, and, hence, the respondent’s designation as an aggravated felon under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. At bottom, we assume that the respondent claims that absent the 1-year sentence, he would not have been designated an aggravated felon, that the removal charge would not have been sustained, and that proceedings would have been terminated. As to the first basis for the motion to reopen, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that he would likely have been granted relief if we had considered his brief on appeal. The respondent has not submitted a copy of the brief or indicated what additional information the appeal brief would have contained beyond the 6-page “Affirmation in Support of the Notice of Appeal” submitted with the appeal on February 11, 2004, which basically raised the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Notably, the respondent has not indicated that the brief would have included the necessary elements to make a cognizable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under rules previously articulated by this Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring that the motion be supported by an affidavit by the alien setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel, including relevant representations; that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond: and that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not). The respondent failed to meet these threshold requirements both in the underlying appeal and in his instant motion. At a minimum, we note that even at this point in these proceedings, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit swearing that his counsel in the criminal proceedings failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his plea to one of the numerous alleged probation violations. Therefore, even if we were to reopen proceedings, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim would be deficient. In this regard, we reject the respondent’s reliance, in the motion to reopen, on his pending motion in New York state court to set aside his one-year criminal sentence. A pending motion to reduce an underlying criminal sentence falls far short of showing clear evidence of prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel during the removal proceedings below. See Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377 (3d Cir. 2003).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 24, 2004. This case was last before us on May 24, 2004, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s January 2, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied. The respondent’s motion is vague and lacking in detail. She asserts that her case was prejudiced by the behavior of an unnamed attorney, presumably, Terrence McGuire, who represented her before the Immigration Judge. The respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements we set forth in See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor has the respondent established that her case was prejudiced by the conduct of her prior attorney. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN RE: LINDA G. MCCALL, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY WILLIAM H. LONG, PETITIONER
File: AXX XX1 767 - California Service Center
August 6, 2004
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert Raymond,
Associate Legal Advisor
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is dismissed. The Regional Service Center (RSC) director instructed the petitioner to submit additional evidence in support of the visa petition, detailing the forms of evidence which might be acceptable. The RSC director correctly determined that the petitioner had failed to adequately respond to the request for additional evidence and had consequently failed to establish the claimed relationship between himself and the beneficiary.
 
Specifically, the petitioner failed to provide evidence that his marriage to the beneficiary was registered and/or recorded after the marriage ceremony. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(2).
 
On appeal, the respondent apparently alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel require compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that such claims require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Rodriguez-Laris v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002)(substantial compliance with Lozada requirements found adequate). As such, the respondent has failed to show that remand on this basis is warranted.
 
The petitioner may, of course, file a new visa petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Angleton, James C., Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated January 2l, 2004. The respondent’s motion is based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that the respondent has largely complied with the procedural requirements for reopening set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, we do not find that the respondent has established that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of his attorney’s allegedly ineffective representation. Id. at 640;Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Even if the facts alleged by the respondent are accepted as true, we do not find that the respondent met his burden of establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of the statutorily protected grounds, or that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted or subjected to torture upon his return to Albania. See section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478 (1992); INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421 (1987); INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407 (1984); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, & R-S-R, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002); Matter of S-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 1306 (BIA 2000). Therefore, we are not persuaded that the respondent would have prevailed on appeal but for former counsel’s allegedly negligent representation. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992)(the party that seeks to reopen bears the “heavy burden” of proving that the result in the case would likely change if proceedings were reopened). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION

Leigh Mapplebeck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On September 22, 1988, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s deportation when he failed to appear for a scheduled deportation hearing. See generally section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). On March 21, 1991, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that decision. The respondent now moves the Board to reopen the proceedings; rescind the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of deportation; and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to enable him to apply for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. With the following comments, we will deny the motion.1
 
The Board entered the final order in these proceedings on March 21, 1991. In our previous decision, we concluded that the respondent failed to establish reasonable cause for his failure to appear at a scheduled hearing, and that his failure to appear resulted in the abandonment of any claim to any form of relief from deportation, or any claim to any other potential benefits under the Act.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before September 30, 1996. We did not receive the motion until June 16, 2004, however. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time
 
The respondent now claims to have been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel in these proceedings. We emphasize, however, that in our previous decision we noted that the record reflected the respondent’s awareness of the scheduled hearing date. Compare, Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997) (holding that an attorney’s failure to notify the alien of his hearing date constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, and was a reasonable cause for the alien’s failure to appear). In his motion, the respondent has put forth neither arguments nor evidence which would persuade us to reopen the proceedings on our own motion at this time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 20 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA1997).
 
*2 In sum, the motion will be denied as untimely. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on March 23, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent did not show that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from either of her prior attorneys. First, the respondent did not fully comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. within whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the Lozada requirements are “not sacrosanct,” the Ninth Circuit has also held that “the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and under ordinary circumstances the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada..” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Here, the respondent submitted a complaint to the State Bar of California and an affidavit regarding each attorney from whom she claims she received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent’s affidavits do not describe “‘in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken … and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Rather, the respondent describes very generally her agreement with each attorney. With regard to her first attorney, the respondent could not recall whether she hired him before or after the date that the first Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent. In addition, the respondent did not submit evidence that she informed either of her prior attorneys of the accusations leveled against them, much less the provision of an opportunity to respond to those accusations. See id.
 
In the absence of an explanation of the representation agreements between the respondent and her prior attorneys, we cannot determine whether the attorneys failed in their duties to the respondent. In this regard, we note that this case does not involve “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel” so as to excuse the respondent from satisfying the formal requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. Castillo-Perez, supra, at 525-26. We therefore find that the respondent failed to show that she received ineffective assistance from either of her prior attorneys. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro Se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dani Lisa Page
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2) (1988)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The case was last before the Board on January 14, 1991, when we continued the case indefinitely to allow the respondent an opportunity to pursue temporary protected status. The Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has submitted a motion requesting that the case be reinstated and the respondent’s appeal adjudicated. The DHS’ motion will be granted and the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
In our decision, dated January 14, 1991, we notified both parties that if they wished further action on the matter, they needed to submit a written request to reinstate proceedings accompanied by certification of service on the opposing party. The DHS has submitted a written request to reinstate proceedings along with certification of service on the respondent. As such, the DHS has complied with our decision dated January 14, 1991, and we will grant the DHS’ motion to reinstate proceedings. As a result, we will now adjudicate the respondent’s appeal.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he was advised not to attend his hearing by counsel. Thus, the respondent’s argument will be construed as an ineffective assistance of counsel argument. However, the record reflects that the respondent was not represented by counsel at the time of his immigration hearing on March 18, 1988. In fact, a Form G-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative) was not filed with the Immigration Court until December 9, 1988. Moreover, the respondent has not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Thus, the respondent’s appeal is without merit.
 
ORDER: The DHS’ motion to reinstate proceedings is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Charles V. Stebley, Esquire

Kevin R. Lashus
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (AXX XXX XXX, AXX XXX XXX)

APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondents appeal an Immigration Judge’s April 16, 2003, denial of their application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The appeal is dismissed.
 
Initially, the respondents argue that they were denied effective assistance of counsel with respect to their application for cancellation of removal. Specifically, they contend that the setting of the merits hearing only 17 days after the Master Calendar hearing deprived them of a reasonable opportunity to prepare for that hearing and prior counsel’s failure to object to that date prevented them from providing the Immigration Judge with adequate documentation in support of their claim. However, upon careful review of the record, we conclude that the respondents have failed to demonstrate that their former counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of proceedings. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 894-97 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent’s former counsel’s actions in failing to object to the setting of the merits hearing 17 days after the Master Calendar hearing does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986)(holding that an attorney’s decision to forego contesting deportability was a tactical decision that did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel). Indeed, the record reflects that the respondents submitted numerous documents and also testified in detail in support of their claims. In the absence of some other significant shortcoming, we cannot conclude that former counsel’s actions in representing the respondents was so deficient as to negatively impact the outcome of proceedings. In addition, with respect to the documents submitted with the respondents’ appeal brief, because our review is limited to the record as it was constituted before the Immigration Judge, we do not consider the evidence submitted on appeal. Matter of Federenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984).
 
Turning to the merits of the respondents’ claims, we note that continuous physical presence and good moral character are not at issue in this case. See section 240A(b)(1) of the Act. Accordingly, the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the respondents have demonstrated that their United States citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if the respondents are ordered removed to Nepal. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act.
 
*2 To establish “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,” an applicant for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act must demonstrate that his or her spouse, parent, or child would suffer hardship that is substantially beyond that which would ordinarily be expected to result from the alien’s deportation, but need not show that such hardship would be “unconscionable.” Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001). The Board has held that although many of the factors that were considered in assessing “extreme hardship” for suspension of deportation should also be considered in evaluating “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,” an applicant for cancellation of removal must demonstrate hardship beyond that which has historically been required in suspension of deportation cases involving the “extreme hardship” standard. Id.; cf. Matter of O-J-O-, 21 I&N Dec. 381 (BIA 1996); Matter of Anderson, 16 I&N Dec. 596 (BIA 1978). In establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal, only hardship to qualifying relatives, not to the applicant himself or herself, may be considered, and hardship factors relating to the applicant may be considered only insofar as they might affect the hardship to a qualifying relative. Matter of Monreal, supra. Moreover, among the factors to be considered in assessing hardship to a cancellation applicant’s children are poor economic conditions and diminished educational opportunities in the country of removal and whether the applicant has family members in that country to assist in his or her adjustment upon return. Matter of Andazola, 23 I&N Dec. 319 (BIA 2002).
 
We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondents have not demonstrated that any hardship their United States citizen children may suffer would rise to the level of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if they are removed from the United States. The qualifying children were 6 and 5 years old at the time of the hearing. The 6 year old speaks some Napalese as well as English and has been diagnosed with asthma. The younger child, although in good health, apparently is in need of some special assistance in her schooling and has repeated kindergarten. See Matter of Monreal, supra (stating that cancellation may be appropriate where a qualifying child has “very serious health issues” or “special needs in school”); Matter of O-J-O-, supra (noting, with respect to suspension of deportation, that an alien’s health and physical condition, including the existence of any serious medical conditions, are factors to be evaluated in determining whether deportation will result in extreme hardship). However, careful review of the record fails to reveal any significant medical evidence reflecting that the older child’s asthma requires specialized treatment or medication or otherwise is considered to be a serious medical problem which could not be adequately treated in Nepal. Moreover, there is no objective evidence that the younger child manifests a learning disability of such severity as to require a specialized educational setting or other intervention shown to be unavailable in Nepal. When viewed in light of the fact that the respondents have no family ties in this country; both adults are highly educated and have transferable skills, they possess significant financial resources including equity in their home estimated to be $190,000, coupled with the fact that they have numerous close relatives in Nepal including the male respondent’s father, mother and brother who also can assist in their reestablishing themselves, the respondents have failed to demonstrate that removal will result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship based solely upon either their older child’s asthma or the younger child’s learning difficulties.
 
*3 Furthermore, the Board recognizes that Nepal likely will not provide the respondents’ children with an education equal to that which they might obtain in the United States. Nonetheless, the respondents have failed to show that their children would be deprived of all schooling or of an opportunity to obtain any education. See Matter of Andazola, supra, at 323. In addition, although they have argued that their children would face financial hardship in Nepal, as noted above, the respondents have significant financial resources. Moreover, the Board has previously held that a lowered standard of living or reduced economic opportunities generally are insufficient to establish a finding of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. See Matter of Andazola, supra (noting a lower standard of living in alien’s home country is insufficient to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)).
 
We note that a deportable alien “cannot gain favored status by the ¿mereº birth of a citizen child,” see Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491, 489-99 (9th Cir. 1986); however, where hardship to the alien’s citizen’s children is extreme, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held in suspension of deportation cases that this alone may warrant suspension of their parent’s deportation. See Cerrillo-Perez v. INS, 809 F.2d 1419, 1422 (9th Cir. 1987). The Ninth Circuit has further held that “the most important single (hardship) factor may be the separation of the alien from family living in the United States.” Contreras-Buenfil v. INS, 712 F.2d 401, (9th Cir. 1983). In fact, where the Board has failed to give this factor “considerable, if not predominant weight,” it has abused its discretion. Gutierrez-Centeno v. INS, 99 F.3d 1529, 1533 (9th Cir. 1996). In this case, the respondents have indicated that their children will accompany them to Nepal and as such, family separation is not at issue.
 
In sum, the evidence of record does not indicate that whatever difficulties the respondents’ children might face in Nepal would rise to the exceptional and extremely unusual standard. See Matter of Andazola, supra (holding that the respondent, an unmarried mother, did not establish eligibility for cancellation where she failed to demonstrate that her 6- and 11-year-old children will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon her removal to Mexico); Matter of Monreal, supra; see also Matter of Pilch, 21 I&N Dec. 627, 631 (BIA 1996) (holding, with respect to suspension of deportation, that cultural adjustment alone does not constitute extreme hardship). Furthermore, whatever financial difficulties the children might face are not likely to be significantly different from those occasioned by deportation generally, particularly to a country with a weaker economy and comparatively fewer employment opportunities. Adjustment to a lower standard of living generally will be insufficient, in and of itself, to support a finding of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. Matter of Monreal, supra.
 
*4 Therefore, even considering all of the factors presented cumulatively, we find that the respondents have not met their burden of establishing that their United States citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if they are removed. The respondents failed to provide evidence that his children would suffer hardship that is substantially different from, or beyond, that which would normally be expected from the deportation of an alien with close family members here. See id.; see also Matter of Andazola, supra. Accordingly, they have not demonstrated eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steve Kreiss, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on April 29, 2004. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on November 20, 2002. We denied a motion to reopen as untimely on May 30, 2003. We reconsidered this order on January 30, 2004, then again denied the motion to reopen on the merits. The pending motion to reopen was filed more than 90 days after our final order of November 20, 2002. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the motion exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen. Id. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied. Although the respondent makes claims against former counsel, who has been suspended from practice before the Board, he does not claim that prior counsel failed to promptly notify him as to the Board’s January 30, 2004, decision. Given that any motion filed after that point would have been late, the respondent fails to explain adequately why he was not able to submit the pending motion until April 29, 2004. This is particularly so given that the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Most significantly, the respondent has not provided former counsel with a chance to respond to the charges. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick Tzeuton, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on June 9, 2004, when we adopted and affirmed the results of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 1, 2003. On July 7, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen for adjustment of status. The motion is denied.
 
The regulations provide that motions to reopen removal proceedings “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing ….” 8 C.F.R. § 3.2. This Board has held that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from deportation bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). We find the respondent’s motion must be denied for failure to submit evidence which is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented at the respondent’s former hearing. The respondent contends the documents were available to his former counsel but were inadvertently not submitted by his former counsel. However, the respondent’s contentions concerning his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance are not substantiated by an affidavit or other evidentiary material. Statements made in a motion are not evidence and are thus not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980).
 
Moreover, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Accordingly, the motion is denied

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ronald Finch, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated therein. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondents raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal. The respondents have failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (B1A 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002)(Lozada requirements need not always be rigidly applied); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331,1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000) (application of Lozada requirements generally reasonable unless facts relating to claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are apparent in the record). Finally, the respondents have not established that they were prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to so depart, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nwadibia, Rochelle A. Fortier
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated June 13, 2001. Although entitled one for reconsideration, the respondent’s motion is correctly characterized as one to reopen as she seeks to introduce new, previously unavailable evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion is time-barred as it was filed on March 31, 2004, far more than 90 days after the Board’s June 13, 2001, decision. Id. The motion is also number-barred as it is the second such motion filed by the respondent. Id. The respondent has submitted an order from a district court in conjunction with her motion which reduces her conviction for theft from a third degree felony to a class A misdemeanor. However, this record does not identify on what basis the respondent’s conviction was reduced. As such, we are unable to ascertain whether the state court action was taken pursuant to a rehabilitative statute or to ameliorate the immigration consequences of the conviction. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that the vacating of an alien’s conviction for possession of a controlled substance for the sole purpose of avoiding the bar to his acquisition of permanent residence did not eliminate the conviction for immigration purposes). As the respondent’s conviction remains final for immigration purposes, the respondent has not shown that she is prima facie eligible for the relief she seeks and we do not find that an exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen is warranted. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000). Finally, the respondent vaguely asserts that she has an unidentified “claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,” but has not complied with any of the requirements for such a claim as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Therefore, reopening on that basis is not warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Van Der Hout, Marc, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evan R. Franke,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated September 24, 2002. The respondent’s motion has been untimely filed, but the respondent argues for equitable tolling of the filing deadline based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he alleges that former counsel failed to inform him that he could present witnesses to establish continuous physical presence in the United States, and that former counsel failed to present evidence of the respondent’s health problems in support of his application for suspension of deportation.
 
Equitable tolling requires a showing of actual prejudice arising from the allegedly ineffective representation of former counsel. See Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Given the respondent’s submission of affidavits in lieu of absent witnesses, we find it difficult to believe that the respondent was unaware that he could present witnesses at the hearing. Moreover, we note that the absence of certain witnesses is but one factor cited by the Immigration Judge; the Immigration Judge also cited the absence of corroborating documentation in finding that the respondent had failed to prove continuous physical presence. With respect to the respondent’s health problems, we note that former counsel has denied the respondent’s allegation of deficient or inadequate performance, asserting that the respondent disclosed no health problems during the preparation of his case, and also noting that the respondent failed to mention any health concerns at the hearing even when specifically asked about his ability to pay for medical care (Tr. at 27). The evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal shows that the respondent incurred modest emergency room charges on June 13, 1997, but there is no indication as to the nature of the emergency room visit. Laboratory reports dating from August 1997 only reflect elevated blood glucose and cholesterol levels. A physician’s note from June 1998 indicates that the respondent was not diagnosed with diabetes until December 1997. We note that no complications of diabetes are mentioned in the respondent’s chart prior to the date of the respondent’s hearing, and that the only restrictions placed on the respondent were dietary in nature. In sum,. the evidence presented does not reveal whether the respondent actually suffered from a particularly serious medical condition at the time of the hearing. Based on the foregoing, we are unable to determine that former counsel’s representation was deficient in any respect, and we are not persuaded that the respondent would have prevailed on appeal but for former counsel’s alleged failure to introduce the additional evidence now proffered. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992)(the party that seeks to reopen bears the “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings were reopened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Philip Hornik, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Administrative closure; suspension of deportation
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM: The respondents have appealed the decision of an Immigration Judge denying them consideration for suspension of deportation. They also requested on appeal that the Board administratively close these proceedings to allow them an opportunity to seek cancellation of removal in removal proceedings. These proceedings will be administratively closed.
 
Pursuant to section 309(c)(3) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No.104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996), the Attorney General may elect to terminate deportation proceedings, in which there has not been a final administrative decision, and reinstate the proceedings as removal proceedings. See also section 203(a)(1) of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193 (1997), amended by Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (1997). This allows non-lawful permanent resident aliens, who are ineligible for suspension of deportation due to the stop-time provision of section 240A(d)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1), to be placed in removal proceedings, where they may apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. However, those individuals with a final administrative decision in their case are not eligible for administrative closure of their cases.
 
It appears from the record that the aliens in the case before us may be eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) as noted above. Accordingly, the proceedings before the Board in this case are administratively closed.
 
If either party to this case objects to the administrative closure of these proceedings, a written request to reinstate the proceedings may be made to the Board. The Board will take no further action in the case unless a request is received from one of the parties. If removal proceedings are not initiated, the party seeking reinstatement must submit the request directly to the Board at the above address, without fee, but with a certification of service on the opposing party. If properly submitted, the Board shall reinstate the proceedings. The final administrative decision was issued by the Board on August 17, 2000. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons the respondents’ motions will be denied.
 
*2 The Board has considered the respondents’ argument that the negligence of their former counsel prejudiced them because they would have been able to apply for suspension of deportation prior to the enactment of the stop-time rule had counsel not unduly delayed their case. Notwithstanding, we find that the stop-time provision applies to orders to show cause issued prior to the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (“IIRIRA”), despite the fact that the respondent may have been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel prior to the enactment of the stop-time rule. See generally Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir. 2001).

IN RE: OROZCO OROZCO, JOSE SANTOS
File: AXX XX0 313 - LOS ANGELES
July 30, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS:
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ana Partida
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge finding the respondent had not established good cause to have his hearing continued on March 20, 2003. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal. The respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002) (Lozada requirements need not always be rigidly applied); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331,1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000) (application of Lozada requirements generally reasonable unless facts relating to claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are apparent in the record). Finally, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
