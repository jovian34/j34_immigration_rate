IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Barsamian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas M. Bernstein
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand; adjustment of status
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 18, 2006, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a 59-year-old native and citizen of Colombia who entered the United States without inspection on or about January 20, 1985. The respondent subsequently was placed into deportation proceedings. Although the respondent’s attorney was present at the scheduled deportation hearing on October 15, 1985, the respondent failed to appear and was ordered deported in absentia.
 
In his motion to reopen, and again on appeal, the respondent claims that he never received notice of his scheduled hearing from the Immigration Court, and moreover, was never informed by his former attorney of the scheduled hearing or of the Immigration Judge’s decision in his case. The respondent contends that he did not learn of the Immigration Judge’s order of deportation until he began the process to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident, based on his 1995 marriage to a United States citizen, in 2001.
 
Insofar as the respondent’s motion requested reopening to pursue his application for adjustment of status, such motion was untimely because it was not filed by September 30, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). We note that contrary to the respondent’s appellate arguments as to having failed to receive the “oral warnings” from the Immigration Judge as to the consequences of failing to appear at his deportation hearing, the result of this case is not guided by our decision in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (Board found that an alien who did not receive oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing held pursuant to section 242B(a) of the Act, and moves to reopen in order to apply for a form of relief that was unavailable at the time of the hearing, the rescission requirements prescribed by section 242B(c) (3) of the Act are not applicable. Instead, the motion to reopen is subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c) and 3.23(b)(3) (1998)), which applies to motions to reopen under section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b, not to motions to reopen under section 242(b) of the Act.1
 
*2 The respondent also requested the reopening of his deportation proceedings, which were conducted in absentia due to his failure to appear. This portion of the motion was premised on his allegation that he did not receive proper notice of the scheduled deportation hearing in his case. We will assume for purposes of this appeal that the respondent filed the motion to reopen in a timely manner as the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2) imposes no time or numerical limitation on aliens seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. See Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999), Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998) (BIA 1998) (discussing the timeliness of motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Act), reaffirmed.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the Immigration Court provided proper notice of the scheduled deportation hearing to the respondent. The Immigration Court sent written notice of the scheduled hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the respondent’s former counsel who appeared at the scheduled hearing without the respondent. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See sections 242(b)(1) and (2) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a)(1985); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). Where the immigration judge concludes that notice of a hearing date has been sufficiently provided to a respondent, and the respondent without reasonable cause fails to appear, the Immigration Judge may conduct an in absentia deportation hearing. See Matter of Munoz-Santos, 20 I&N Dec. 205, 208 (BIA 1999).
 
The question remaining is whether the respondent’s claim that he failed to receive notice of his hearing was caused by the negligence of his former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must not only satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), but also the claimant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). There is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence to suggest that his former counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. The respondent’s former attorney indicated that she sent all the notices received from the Immigration Court (e.g., notices of the scheduled deportation hearings, copy of the Immigration Judge’s decision, etc.) to the address provided to her by the respondent. She maintains that none of the communications she sent to the respondent was ever returned to her as undeliverable. In the instant case, the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for proving that his former counsel was negligent by possibly sending the respondent notice of the scheduled hearing to an incorrect address. Therefore, having failed to demonstrate that she was negligent, we cannot find that the respondent had reasonable cause for missing his hearing by virtue of his former attorney’s alleged negligence.
 
*3 Aside from his arguments regarding lack of notice, the respondent has not contended that he had any other “reasonable cause” for missing his scheduled hearing. See Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987).
 
For the aforementioned reasons, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request to reopen these deportation proceedings.2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and the Immigration Judge’s order of deportation is left undisturbed.

In Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155, 1160 (BIA 1999), we found it unnecessary to decide whether to extend our holding in Matter of M-S-, supra, to deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act.

2

We observe, inter alia, as noted by the Immigration Judge in denying the respondent’s motion, the respondent “entered written pleadings to the charges in the Order to Show Cause (form I-221), admitting that he was deportable as charged and stating that he would only seek voluntary departure as relief from deportation.” Moreover, contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, the Immigration Judge noted that the “pleadings were signed in the original by the respondent and reflect that ¿theyº were explained to him in the Spanish language.”

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anthony O. Egbase, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination of proceedings
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on January 21, 2000, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s order of removal. On July 13, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen through which he seeks the reopening and termination of proceedings based upon an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel and his June 26, 2006, vacating of his conviction. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the motion. The motion to reopen is granted. The record is remanded.
 
With his motion, the respondent provides documents showing that he filed a motion to vacate with the appropriate California state court seeking to vacate his conviction pursuant to Calif. Penal Code § 1016.5, alleging that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea and was denied his constitutional right to an interpreter. See Resp. Mot. at Tab 1. However, the court’s minute order indicates that the respondent’s conviction was vacated pursuant to Calif. Penal Code § 1385 “in the interests of justice.” See Resp. Mot. at Tab 2. It is not clear why the court vacated the conviction under Calif. Penal Code § 1385 rather than the requested Calif. Penal Code § 1016.5. We therefore find that a remand is warranted in this case in order to allow the Immigration Judge to make findings of fact regarding whether the respondent’s conviction has been vacated and if yes, whether that conviction remains a conviction for immigration purposes. At the remanded hearing, the respondent shall also be provided an opportunity to apply for any relief from removal for which he might be eligible should his conviction stand for immigration purposes. Because we are remanding the record for a determination regarding the status of the respondent’s conviction as it relates to his removability, we need not reach the issue of whether his former attorney provided him with ineffective assistance.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reconsider
 
*1 An Immigration Judge on December 14, 1999, found the respondent removable under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), and ordered her deported to Jamaica in absentia. The respondent, through counsel, filed an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. On April 16, 2003, the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent filed an appeal with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which was dismissed on September 18, 2003. Her attorney was suspended by the Arizona bar on April 23, 2005. She filed an untimely motion to reopen with the Board on October 28, 2005. The Board denied the motion on April 10, 2006, because it was untimely and failed to meet the requirements for an exception to the denial of an untimely motion to reopen an in absentia proceeding. On May 9, 2006, she filed a motion to reconsider. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent married a United States citizen on March 11, 1997, and he filed a visa petition on her behalf, along with her application for adjustment of status. The Notice to Appear was issued on October 8, 1999, after she and her husband did not appear for their interview.1 On August 25, 1999, the respondent’s husband withdrew the petition with a statement that the marriage was a sham and that she had paid him to marry her to gain immigration benefits. The Immigration and Naturalization Service denied her adjustment of status on September 3, 1999. She was divorced from her husband on October 28, 1999. The respondent married another United States citizen on May 6, 2000. His visa petition on her behalf was approved on May 10, 2006. They have two United States citizen children. She contends the Board erred in denying her motion to reopen because she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. She wishes the proceedings to be reopened and remanded so she can apply for adjustment of status.
 
The respondent is a 42-year-old native and citizen of Jamaica who entered the United States on or about December 31, 1996, as a visitor and remained longer than permitted. She asserts that she divorced her first husband because he was a drug addict and that the marriage had been bona fide. She moved from Florida to Arizona after her divorce and she found an attorney there whom she hired to help her. She states that the motion to reopen in absentia proceedings should be granted because she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because the respondent failed to meet the requirements for reopening an in absentia order of removal set forth under section 240B(5) of the Act, the Board has no authority to rescind the respondent’s order of deportation.
 
A motion to reconsider is used to allege errors in appraising the facts and the law and must be supported by precedent decisions. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991), aff’d, Cerna v. INS, 979 F.2d 212 (11th Cir. 1992); Matter of Tiwari, 20 I&N Dec. 254 (BIA 1991). An order of removal following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, or upon a motion filed at any time if he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).
 
*2 The Eleventh Circuit has held that the requirements of section 240(b)(5) of the Act are mandatory and jurisdictional. Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir. 1999); see Abdi v. United States Attorney General, 430 F.3d 1148 (11th Cir. 2005). Moreover, the respondent does not claim she was unaware of the hearing in Miami, and she would not have been eligible for any relief from removal, even if she had attended the hearing. The respondent does not meet the statutory requirements for recission of the in absentia order. Therefore, the Board did not err in denying the motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shan D. Potts, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Arrived at a time or place not designated by the Attorney General
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge decision denying him any relief from removal and he has requested that the record be remanded for further proceedings based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
While we agree with the respondent on appeal that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has determined that the basic requirements for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel we have laid out in the past are not sacrosanct, they still merit some consideration. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 356 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. 2004)(considering Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)). Under our holding in Matter of Lozada, supra, in addition to other requirements, it is incumbent on the claimant to establish that he or she suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The Ninth Circuit has stated that a respondent need only show that he has plausible grounds for relief to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the actions of counsel. This decision, however, still retains the requirement that the respondent demonstrate prejudice. See Lin v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Here the respondent’s new counsel has simply stated that previous counsel was ineffective with no other support for this claim. It does appear from the record that there were problems with the representation. Tr. at 8. The record, however, just as easily supports the idea that the respondent, himself, failed to adequately pursue his applications for relief, as it does any ineffectiveness of counsel. We note that the respondent has made no claims with his appeal to have attempted to contact his previous counsel in the time leading up to his hearing. Further, the respondent has not explained how any ineffective assistance of counsel led him to provide false information to the Immigration Judge at the hearing below (Tr. at 9, 11-13). More important than all of this to our decision, however, is the fact that the respondent has failed to show how any alleged prior ineffective assistance of counsel has prejudiced him in anyway. He is clearly removable as charged and has not demonstrated any eligibility for cancellation of removal, having testified to first entering the country in 2005 or 2000.
 
*2 Perhaps, had the respondent been better represented, he might have been advised to provide truthful testimony regarding the date of his arrival and any past arrests. His statements in this regard appear to have incurred the ire of the Immigration Judge leading to a denial of voluntary departure. We note, however, that when asked a second time, by government counsel, the respondent was forthcoming. Further, he does, apparently, have a lawful permanent resident spouse through whom he hopes to adjust status. Given that he otherwise appears eligible for this relief (Tr. at 10-13), we will grant the respondent voluntary departure. As outlined below, however, there are very serious consequences should the respondent fail to depart pursuant to this grant of relief. In particular, we point out to the respondent that should he fail to comply with this order, he may be barred from adjusting his status to lawful permanent resident, on any basis, for the next 10 years.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed with respect to any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The outstanding order of removal is withdrawn and in lieu of removal, and conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order, or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 240.26(c) and (f). In the event that the respondent fails to depart or comply with the conditions set forth below, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent must post a voluntary departure bond in the amount of $500 with the district director within 10 business days of the date of this order. If the bond is not posted within 10 business days, the order of voluntary departure is automatically vacated on the following business day, and the respondent is ordered removed as provided by the Immigration Judge’s Order.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cecil Harrigan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
This case was last before us on March 29, 2006, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal of an Immigration Judge’s written decision, dated September 6, 2005, denying their second motion to reopen, in which they claimed that they received ineffective assistance from their former attorney, S. Eric Shakir, Esquire, and through which they sought rescission of the in absentia order entered against them on July 27, 2004. The respondents have filed a timely motion to reconsider with which they have provided evidence showing that although the transmittal letter for the Immigration Judge’s decision reflects a date of September 7, 2005, the decision was actually mailed on September 12, 2005, as reflected by the postmark on the mailing envelope. As the respondents have shown that their appeal was timely filed, we will vacate our prior order and reinstate their appeal. Because our prior order was issued after the expiration of the briefing schedule, we will next address the merits of the respondents appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed with the exception of the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondents’ had not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(b)(5)(C), expressly requires that a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia removal order based upon exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order. The respondents’ admittedly late filed motion to reopen therefore falls within this statutory bar and prohibits the rescission of the in absentia order.
 
Moreover, the Immigration Judge correctly found that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998).1 The language of section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act regarding the time limit within which a motion to reopen must be filed is clear on its face and unambiguous, and the statute contains no exceptions to this time bar. Id. The respondents argue that the untimeliness and number-barred status of their motion should be excused under the equitable tolling doctrine because they received ineffective assistance from former counsel and have acted diligently.2 However, neither the Board nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit have held that untimely motions to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal are subject to the equitable tolling doctrine. We decline to apply that doctrine in this case. Because the respondents’ motion to reopen was untimely filed before the Immigration Judge, and they have not shown “exceptional circumstances,” their appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of their second motion to reopen is dismissed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted:
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s March 29, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is reinstated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, arose within the context of deportation proceedings pursuant to former section 242B of the Act. However, as section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act sets forth identical language to that contained in section 242B(c)(3), we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, by analogy.

Throughout these proceedings, the respondents have identified no form of relief from removal for which they are eligible and would have sought but for former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness and the record contains no applications for relief from removal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles Kuck, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arthur S. Raznick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Jamaica, has appealed the Immigration Judge s decision to deny her motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The record is remanded.
 
The record reflects that on November 21, 2005, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States because she failed to appear for her hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on December 21, 2005, but that request was denied on January 27, 2006. This timely appeal followed.
 
In the instant case, the respondent indicated that she missed her hearing on account of “exceptional circumstances.” The respondent does not dispute that she was notified of the correct date and time of the hearing. She states, however, that she mistakenly believed that her hearing was scheduled for November 21, 2005, at 4:30 p.m., rather than at 8:30 a.m. She further argues that she discussed her case with her prior attorney before the hearing, mentioned that it was set for 4:30 p.m., and her counsel did not correct her misunderstanding. The respondent further argues that her former counsel was negligent in these proceedings. The specific allegations against counsel are reflected in the respondent’s brief and motion to reopen, and need not be repeated. We further note that the respondent submitted a complaint against former counsel with the Arizona Bar Association.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion, the Immigration Judge sets forth the procedural history of the case, and notes that the respondent received notice of the hearing. The Immigration Judge does not, however, address with specificity the respondent’s argument that her good faith confusion regarding the hearing date combined with the alleged negligence of former counsel constitutes an “exceptional circumstance” to excuse her failure to appear.
 
In considering this appeal, we note our decision in Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994). Therein, we indicated that when a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is denied, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision; otherwise, the parties are deprived of a fair opportunity to contest the Immigration Judge’s determination on appeal, and the Board is unable to meaningfully exercise its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal. See generally also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999).
 
In the instant case, the Immigration Judge stales in his decision that the respondent did not establish that her failure to appear for her hearing was caused by an “exceptional circumstance.” However, the Immigration Judge does not provide any analysis of the respondent’s specific arguments in support of reopening.
 
*2 Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. On remand, the Immigration Judge shall address the respondent’s arguments, and shall specifically address whether the respondent is entitled to reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec: 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (alien must show the outcome of a proceeding might have been affected by the negligence of counsel). The respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, should be served with a copy of the decision and should thereafter be given an opportunity to submit briefs, in accordance with the regulations. The record should then be forwarded to the Board for further consideration.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL/MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Allen Flynn, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand; waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to Section 212(c)
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 15, 2005, decision to deny his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent has also filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion denied.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to find that the respondent warrants a discretionary grant pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act. Notwithstanding the respondent’s appellate arguments regarding the complexity of his financial and corporate dealings, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent carries the burden of demonstrating that he is worthy of such relief as a matter of discretion. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978); see also Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294 (BIA 1991); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191 (BIA 1990); Matter of Buscemi, 19 I&N Dec. 628 (BIA 1988). As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent has failed to take responsibility for the various financial debts with which he of his various corporations have defaulted (I.J. at 3). Moreover, the respondent has failed to make reparations therefore, even though he has professed that he has various stocks available to him and a net worth of approximately two million dollars. Lastly, the respondent appears to show no remorse for the harm he has caused, and has explained, repeatedly, that he is without fault for these numerous unpaid debts. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that even though he may not have received criminal convictions for his financial dealings during the past few years, he has continued to accrue numerous civil liabilities for such transactions. Due to this ongoing behavior pattern, in conjunction with his evasive testimony and his misrepresentations regarding his parole violations, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he is deserving of a discretionary grant of section 212(c) relief.
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge assumed a biased and prosecutorial role during the March 15, 2005, hearing, and that his former counsel failed to object to such tactics and also failed to provide clarifying information to the Court regarding why the respondent has been subject to approximately 15 civil lawsuits. With his motion, the respondent has demonstrated that he has met the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), but he has failed to demonstrate that he experienced prejudice on account of his former attorney’s alleged deficiencies. The record indicates that the respondent received a full and fair hearing, and we do not find any evidence that the Immigration Judge acted in an unacceptable manner. See Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982). In fact, the record indicates that the Immigration Judge continued the hearing to allow the respondent an opportunity to present further evidence in defense of the government’s allegations regarding his legal and financial issues (Tr. at 115). Accordingly, we find no reason to remand the record for further proceedings, and the motion to remand is denied.
 
*2 The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monique Harris
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s March 28, 2006, order of removal. To resolve any issues regarding the timeliness of the appeal, we are reviewing this case on certification pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he is a United States citizen and provides documentation in support of this claim. The respondent states that he was born out of wedlock on November 17, 1968, and entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident to live with his father on September 21, 1976. He also advises that his father became a naturalized United States citizen on June 9, 1975, and married a United States citizen on June 11, 1977.
 
We find that the facts presented by the respondent on appeal do not establish that the respondent derived United States citizenship from either his father or his stepmother. In order to derive United States citizenship, both of the respondent’s biological parents must have naturalized prior to his 18th birthday because the amendments to former section 321 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, created through the October 30, 2000, enactment of the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (“CCA”), were not retroactive. See Nehme v. INS, 252 F.3d 415 (5th Cir. 2001); Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, 23 I&N Dec. 153 (BIA 2001). The respondent admits that he has never known his biological mother. Thus, he cannot establish that he derived United States citizen from both of his biological parents in accordance with former section 321 of the Act. In addition, he had provided no evidence showing that his stepmother adopted him and therefore has not shown that he could have derived United States citizenship from her.
 
The respondent also argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over his case because the Notice to Appear was filed in Boston, Massachusetts, and venue was not properly changed to Oakdale, Louisiana. The respondent further contends that since jurisdiction in Massachusetts is proper, that the case law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit cannot be used to support a finding of removability in his case as the law of the First Circuit should be applied.
 
*2 The record shows that the Notice to Appear was served on the respondent in Massachusetts but that the Notice to Appear was not filed with an Immigration Court until the respondent was transferred to a federal facility in Louisiana. See Exh. 1 (Notice to Appear); Form I-830 (November 2, 2005, Notice to EOIR of Alien Address). The filing of the Notice to Appear with the Oakdale Immigration Court provided the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the respondent’s case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14. Where the respondent was located at the time that he was served with the Notice to Appear does not affect the Immigration Court’s jurisdiction. In addition, the information on the Notice to Appear, advising the respondent that a hearing in Boston would be set at a future date did not confer jurisdiction on the Boston Immigration Court when the document was, in fact, filed with the Oakdale Immigration Court. As jurisdiction with the Oakdale Immigration Court was proper, the Immigration Judge did not err by relying upon a precedent decision of the Fifth Circuit in finding the respondent removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
The respondent additionally contends that he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney, Leo Jerome Lahey, because counsel did not object to the Immigration Cour’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the charging document had been filed in Massachusetts and the respondent had derived United States citizenship. In light of our disposition of the Immigration Court’s jurisdiction on these two issues, discussed above, we find no ineffective assistance by the respondent’s former counsel notwithstanding the respondent’s failure to comply with any of the ineffective assistance of counsel requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; cancellation of removal
 
PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order, in these proceedings was entered by the Board on December 24, 2003, at which time we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s September 15, 2003, decision finding the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for cancellation of removal or other requested relief due to his conviction for an aggravated felony. The respondent has filed a motion reopen received by the Board on June 12, 2006. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before March 23, 2004. As noted, previously, however, the Board did not receive the motion until June 12, 2006, more than two years beyond the due date. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
The respondent raises some issues that appear to be an attempt to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, such that the Board might consider tolling the time limits for filing his motion. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000) (finding that time limits for motions may be equitably tolled based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The ineffective assistance of which the respondent complains in his motion, however, pertains to the representation he received in his criminal proceedings, and not to any representation in these removal proceedings. In fact, the record reflects that the respondent has never been represented in these proceedings. We therefore find no reason to toll the time limits for the filing of a. motion. We further point out. that, although the respondent entitles his motion as one “to reopen,” it is primarily in the nature of a motion to reconsider because he alleges legal error in the determination that he has been convicted of an aggravated felony and is ineligible for relief from removal on that basis. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2), a motion to reconsider the Board’s decision must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of the decision. Thus, regardless of whether the motion is one to reopen or reconsider, it is untimely. Accordingly, the motion is denied.¿FN1º

We also note that the respondent has submitted to the Board what appear to be documents pertaining to a custody redetermination request made to the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). As there are no bond proceedings pending before the Board, we decline to address these documents.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case is presently before us pursuant to the February 2; 2006, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The court remanded the case for a finding whether the respondent exercised due diligence “in discovering that he has been misled or injured” by alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The court also referred to disciplinary proceedings before the New York Supreme Court, and stated that, “we expect that the disciplinary report will have some bearing on the analysis of the Immigration Judge’s assessment of blame.” Although the case was remanded to the Board, it appears that a further remand to the Immigration Judge is required, as there are factual findings to be made and possible new evidence to be considered.¿FN1º Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the court’s decision.

We note that the court directed its clerk to forward the disciplinary report to the Board; but it has never been sent to us. If she finds it necessary, the Immigration Judge can seek to obtain the report on remand.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on February 28, 2002, when we returned the record to the Immigration Court since we are precluded by the Act from considering an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The respondent subsequently filed amotion to reopen, which was granted by the Immigration Judge on April 29, 2002. A new hearing was scheduled, but the respondent failed to appear for the hearing on January 4, 2005, and was ordered removed in absentia. On January 13, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which was denied by the Immigration Judge. The respondent now appeals that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that she was unable to appear for her hearing as she did not have the hearing notice to gain access to the federal building where the Immigration Court is located. She asserts that the proceedings should be reopened pursuant to Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d cir. 2005). The respondent also asserts that she is eligible for adjustment of status pursuant to Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002).
 
The respondent has failed to establish that the proceedings must be reopened pursuant to Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005)(IJ arbitrarily applied Lozada, and failed to consider alien’s claim that security guards’ conduct rendered his failure to appear “reasonable”). In that case, the alien argued that he established reasonable cause for his failure to appear, based on the claim in his motion to reopen and accompanying affidavit that he was prevented from attending his exclusion hearing because security guards would not admit him without a hearing notice that was in the possession of his attorney, who was inside the building. The Immigration Judge determined that the alien essentially was alleging ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), but he failed to comply with the requirements for a motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Lozada. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion in determining that the alien could not show “reasonable cause” for his failure to appear, since the court did not agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that alien’s claim was “in essence” one of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that “essence” of alien’s claim was that security guards barred his entry to the court despite his assertions that he had a hearing and that his attorney had the hearing notice inside the building. The court remanded the case for further proceedings for a determination of whether the alien’s excuse offered in his affidavit was sufficient to establish reasonable cause.
 
*2 In this matter, the respondent does not contend that she failed to receive notice of her hearing. Indeed, she asserts that she arrived at the Immigration Court building to attend her hearing on January 4, 2005; but she was unable to enter the building as she did not have a copy of the notice of hearing with her. The Immigration Judge’s in absentia order was entered on January 4, 2005, but the respondent did not file a motion to reopen until January 13, 2006. Therefore, the respondent failed to file her motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the final order, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Furthermore, in contrast to the alien in Twum v. INS, supra, the respondent failed to file an affidavit in support of her motion to reopen. Therefore, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that reopening in this matter is warranted based on Twum v. INS, supra.
 
The respondent also contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reopen, as she is eligible for adjustment of status under Matter of Velarde, supra. We note that Matter of Velarde, supra, did not arise in the context of in absentia proceedings. Rather, the respondent sought reopening before the Board to apply for a new form of relief within 90 days of the Board’s decision dismissing his appeal. Id. at 256. As the respondent was ordered removed in absentia, we must look to in absentia case law and statutes for guidance in this matter. In a deportation case, we found that an alien is not required to rescind his deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349(BIA 1998). Section 240(b)(7) of the Act sets forth a similar limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a removal hearing, as follows:
Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and who, at the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 239(a), was provided oral notice, either in the alien’s native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)) to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section 240A, 240B, 245, 248, or 249 for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.
 
 
The Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent, and she was provided oral notice of the consequences of a failure to appear as provided in section 240(b)(7) of the Act. Consequently, it appears that the respondent is ineligible to seek adjustment of status pursuant to section 240(b)(7) of the Act. Moreover, the respondent’s motion was filed untimely. See Matter of Velarde, supra; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Finally, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter is before the Board following a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The remand is for the Board to determine in the first instance whether equitable tolling should be applied to the time limits for filing a motion to reopen in light of the respondent’s contention before the Board and the Immigration Judge that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his 1995 deportation proceedings and thereafter.¿FN1º Upon consideration of this issue, we find the respondent has not established that equitable tolling should be applied to his case. Accordingly, we will again dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was not filed with the Immigration Judge by September 30, 1996, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), but was filed in December 2003, more than 7 years later. The respondent contends that the ineffective assistance of counsel he received is a basis for tolling the time limit for filing the motion. Several federal appellate courts have held that the time period for filing a motion to reopen is subject to equitable tolling. See, e.g., Hernandez-Moran v. Gonzales, 408 F.3d 496, 499-500 (8th Cir. 2005); Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (10th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1190-93 (9th Cir. 2001); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000). But see Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that former statute setting forth time limit for motions to reopen set forth a ““mandatory and jurisdictional”” time bar). While the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has not yet resolved this issue, the Court has held that where equitable tolling is available, it requires a showing of due diligence. See Boakai v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2006); Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, n.3 (1st Cir. 2005). Here, the respondent has failed to establish that he exercised due diligence.
 
The respondent contends in his affidavit that his former attorney mishandled his case by failing to make the necessary filings to allow the conditions on his conditional resident status to be removed and later in making errors related to his attempt to adjust his status based upon his 1994 marriage to his United States citizen wife. He further contends that he was placed in deportation proceedings as a result of his former attorney’s errors and that she did not advise him of the date of his hearing, so he was not present for the hearing. The respondent alleges that his former attorney erred in requesting voluntary departure on his behalf instead of seeking adjustment of status. The respondent also contends that after the Immigration Judge issued an order of voluntary departure, his former attorney advised him that she was unable to provide as much assistance as he needed and then negligently referred him to an unqualified “immigration consultant,” who was her associate. He contends the referral was so that the respondent would not be told the former attorney had made errors in handling the case. The respondent alleges that the referral did, in fact, prevent him from understanding what had happened with his case. He states that other attorneys from whom he later sought assistance also mishandled his case, which is why his motion to reopen was not filed with the Immigration Judge until 2003.
 
*2 The respondent’s affidavit does not explain how long he used the services of the “immigration consultant” after the referral in 1995, and it also does not provide any detail about what occurred during the 8 years that passed from the time of the Immigration Judge’s order to the time the motion to reopen was filed. The respondent states in his affidavit that he cannot remember the exact order or the number of people he consulted but that he paid many people and did not receive effective assistance from any of them. The respondent provides several examples of attorneys whom he consulted and the amounts they charged him. He does not, however, provide enough detail in the affidavit to explain the exceedingly lengthy delay in filing the motion to reopen. Moreover, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has submitted documentation that the attorney who finally did file the motion to reopen in 2003 was representing the respondent as early as 1997. The DHS has submitted evidence from the respondent’s file that the attorney filed a Notice of Appearance (Form G-28) on behalf of the respondent before the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the DHS) on April 14, 1997, and again on March 17, 1998. The records also show that this attorney filed a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I- 130) by the respondent’s wife on behalf of the respondent on July 23, 1997. On March 17, 1998, the attorney prepared an Application to Register Permanent Residence (Form I-485) on behalf of the respondent. However, the respondent does not explain why the motion to reopen was not filed by his attorney until 2003.¿FN2º The respondent refers to the continued deceit of the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge in 1995, but he offers nothing specific to explain how her alleged continued deceit prevented him from filing a motion to reopen at least by 1997, when he was represented by the attorney who eventually filed the motion.
 
Given that the respondent did not establish that he exercised due diligence in pursuit of his claims, we find that equitable tolling should not apply in this case. See Boakai v. Gonzales, supra. We will, therefore, dismiss the respondent’s appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a) 1(B)º- Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reconsider
 
This case was last before the Board on January 23, 2006, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s many motions to reopen and reconsider the order of deportation entered against him in absentia on September 15, 1995. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2006, decision once again denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2005, decision denying his third motion to reopen his proceedings and rescind the order of deportation entered in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
This case presents a long and complex history before the Immigration Judge and this Board. Originally, the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absencia at his scheduled hearing on September 15, 1995, when he failed to appear. On August 29, 1997, the respondent filed his first motion to reopen arguing that his failure to appear for his scheduled September 15, 1995, hearing was the result of lack of notice. This motion was denied by the Immigration Judge on January 29, 1998, when he found that both the respondent and his counsel had been properly served by certified mail with the notice of the hearing. Specifically, the Immigration Judge noted that both the respondent and his “counsel of record” had been sent hearing notices via certified mail and that each had been properly served despite the return of the respondent’s notice as “unclaimed.”
 
Subsequently, on August 16, 2004, the respondent filed his second motion to reopen alleging both lack of notice of the scheduled hearing and ineffective assistance of counsel against his former counsel. According to the respondent’s second motion, his former counsel did not in fact represent him in these proceedings as no Notice of Appearance (Form EOIR-28) was ever filed and, as such, notice to counsel was not sufficient. The respondent further noted that it was this former counsel that had provided the respondent’s “last known address” to the Immigration Court without his knowledge. This motion was denied by the Immigration Judge on September 27, 2004, when he concluded that the respondent had failed to comply with our requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Thereafter, on April 18, 2005, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen again arguing lack of notice of his September 15, 1995, hearing date and ineffective assistance of counsel. Along with his motion, the respondent provided evidence arguing that it showed his compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra. However, on May 19, 2005, the Immigration Judge, based upon the history of this case, found that the respondent’s claims of lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel were not credible and again concluded that the respondent had been properly served with notice of his original hearing when both he and his former counsel were sent notices via certified mail. On June 8, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider this decision with the Immigration Judge and on August 5, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion finding the respondent incredible based upon some “material misrepresentations” found his asylum application. In particular, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had been convicted in federal court of the offense of alien smuggling and had failed to notify court of his conviction. The Immigration Judge also noted that this conviction renders the respondent ineligible for asylum. The respondent appealed this decision to the Board.
 
*2 On January 23, 2006, this Board remanded respondent’s proceedings to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and fact-finding regarding the denial of the reapondent’s numerous motions to reopen and his motion to reconsider. Specifically the Board remanded for consideration of whether the respondent’s failure to appear in the first instance was the result of the ineffective assistance of counsel, whether the respondent’s prior motions to reopen failed as result of further ineffective assistance of counsel from various other attorneys, and whether the respondent pursued due diligence in pursuing reopening after the in absentia order to support equitable tolling under the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit’s, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, decision in Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). On remand, the Immigration Judge issued a decision on April 21, 2006, upholding all prior decisions on the respondent’s motions and noting the respondent’s ineligibility for asylum due to his recent conviction for alien smuggling. The respondent appeals this decision.
 
Initially, we address the first issue raised by the Board in its January 23, 2006, remand regarding whether the respondent’s failure to appear in the first instance was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, we note that in his September 27, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s first motton to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had been properly served with notice of the September 15, 1995, hearing because notices are sent both to the respondent and his “counsel of record” via certified mail. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s notice was sent to his “last known address of record” as provided to the court by respondent’s counsel and that this notice was returned by the post office as “unclaimed.” The Immigration Judge also noted that the notice sent to the respondent’s “counsel of record” was not returned and was presumed received. However, as argued by the respondent in his second motion to reopen filed on September 16, 2004, there is no evidence in the record indicating that respondent’s counsel ever filed a Notice of Appearance with the Immigration Court. As a result, the respondent was not represented during these initial proceedings and the address of record provided for the respondent by counsel was not properly done on behalf of the respondent. As a result, it appears that the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s first motion to reopen was not entirely correct in determining that proper notice of the scheduled hearing date had been provided to the respondent.
 
In this regard, we point out that because the respondent’s change of address after he was released from detention was provided by an attorney that did not actually represent him, it was the respondent’s own responsibility to provide his change of address and to keep the Immigration Court apprized of his address immediately after being released from detention. Therefore, despite the errors in the Immigration Judge’s original September 27, 2004, determination that the respondent had been provided sufficient notice of his hearing date, we find that because the respondent failed to provide his address after his release from detention, there was no requirement that he be notified of the hearing at all. See Matter of Villalba-Sinaloa, 21 I&N Dec. 842 (BIA 1997) (if alien receives charging document but does not provide an address of record, there is no requirement that he be notified of the hearing). Thus, we agree that the respondent’s failure to appear in the first instance could not have been the result of ineffective assistance of counsel where the respondent himself concedes that he was not represented by the counsel whom he accuses of ineffectiveness and where there was no requirement of notice due to the respondent’s own failure to provide his address.
 
*3 Moreover, based upon the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge’s subsequent September 27, 2004, denial of the respondent’s second motion to reopen was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. As previously noted, the respondent was not in fact represented by counsel during his initial proceedings or during the adjudication of his first motion to reopen. It would be incongruous then to find that the respondent was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel where there is no counsel of record as an attorney is only considered to be an attorney of record when a Notice of Appearance is filed, and not by the filing of any other documents on behalf of an alien. See, i.e., Singh v. INS, 315 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2003). In this regard, we also cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge’s May 19, 2005, denial of the respondent’s third motion to reopen based upon his negative determination on the respondent’s credibility and his determination that notice in the first instance was proper was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. There is no evidence that counsel’s actions in filing this third motion resulted in any prejudice to the respondent where we have already determined that there was no requirement of notice to the respondent of his original hearing.
 
Based upon the foregoing, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2006, denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2005, denial of his third motion to reopen, and we find it unnecessary to address whether the respondent has successfully pursued due diligence in pursuing reopening in this case sufficient to support equitable tolling of the filing deadlines under Iavorski v. INS, supra. We cannot find that the decisions rendered in this case were the result of ineffective assistance of counsel thus making a discussion under Iavorski moot.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s December 15, 2005, decision denying his motion to reopen his proceedings based upon his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant on February 4, 1996, with permission to remain for a temporary period not to exceed the duration of his academic studies and practical training (Exh. 1). The respondent remained in the United States beyond the date of his completion of studies without applying for practical training or authorization from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to adjust his status (Exh. 1). Subsequently, on January 23, 2003, the respondent was convicted in the Superior Court ¿atº Grant County, Washington, for the offense of possession of marijuana in violation of Revised Code of Washington section 69.50.401. (Exh. 3). As a result of the foregoing, the respondent was placed into these proceedings with the issuance of a Notice to Appear on January 24, 2003 (Exh. 1).
 
On February 24, 2003, the respondent was granted voluntary departure until June 23, 2003, in lieu of removal. The respondent failed to depart at the end of his voluntary departure term and on May 31, 2005, the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen based upon his marriage to a United States citizen on June 19 2003, and his claim that he was eligible for adjustment of status. On June 28, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on both substantive and jurisdictional grounds noting the respondent’s ineligibility for adjustment of status as a result of his failure to timely depart pursuant to voluntary departure and the untimeliness of the respondent’s motion to reopen which was due on or before May 26, 2003. The respondent did not appeal from this decision.
 
In early September 2005, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a second motion to reopen claiming that the motion was mailed on July 29, 2005, despite the postmark on the envelope dated August 31, 2005. This motion was rejected by the Immigration Court on September 7, 2005, for failure to include a certificate of service as required by regulation. On December 8, 2005, about 3 months later, respondent’s counsel re-filed his motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel levied against respondent’s former counsel. In particular, the respondent argued first that his first former counsel erred in failing to file a timely motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status based upon his June 19, 2003, marriage. The respondent also argued that his former counsel erred in failing to seek an extension of his voluntary departure period. Finally, the respondent argued that his former counsel erred in failing to appeal the Immigration Judge’s February 24, 2003, decision granting his application for voluntary departure.
 
*2 On December 20, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen filed through current counsel based again on the respondent’s ineligibility for adjustment of status and the untimeliness of the motion. Despite the respondent’s arguments on appeal, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. As pointed out by the DHS all three of the respondent’s assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel lack merit. First, we note that a motion to reopen filed in regard to the Immigration Judge’s February 24, 2003, decision was due on or before May 27, 2003,¿FN1º while his marriage upon which the bases his claim of eligibility for the relief sought, took place on June 19, 2003, approximately a month after the regulatory due date for a motion to reopen. As a result, the respondent cannot now claim that he was prejudiced by his former cousel’s failure to file the motion because it would have been untimely even if filed on the date of the marriage. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2006).
 
Moreover, the Immigration Judge allowed the respondent the maximum grant of voluntary departure in his February 24, 2003, decision, extending the period to June 23, 2003, or 120 days. See section 240B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(2). Therefore, the respondent was not eligible for an extension of voluntary departure and failure to seek such resulted in no prejudice to the respondent. Finally, we note that the respondent was required to waive appeal of all issues as a precondition of receiving voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act, and the Immigration Judge’s decision reflects just such a waiver. See Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999). As a result, the respondent cannot now argue that his attorney erred in failing to seek an appeal to which the respondent was not entitled.
 
In sum, the respondent is unable to establish that he has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, each of the respondent’s motions to reopen have been untimely filed and are barred by regulation. Thus, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: IVIS ESTHER FAJARDO-PEREZ
File: AXX XX6 431 - Miami
July 26, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Idalis Perez-Alvarez, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the decision dated March 7, 2006, in which an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on February 6, 2002. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that the illness of the respondent’s grandfather was not an “exceptional circumstance,” and in determining that the respondent did not show due diligence in trying to reopen her case. She states that after much effort to obtain legal assistance, she finally retained the services of a private attorney. However, she indicates that by the time she was able to retain a private attorney, her time to file the motion directly with the Immigration Court had expired. The respondent claims that she did everything that she was able to do to take care of her situation in Immigration Court, and asserts that she visited several non-profit organizations that decided they could not accept her case. She also states that she was unaware of the process required to reopen her case, but she did attempt to resolve the situation in the Immigration Court as soon as she learned of her order of removal; however, she did not have the proper representation to do so. The respondent avers that her due diligence in having her case reopened was affected by the ineffective assistance of her former counsel because he did not proceed with the case in a proper manner.
 
An order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). Furthermore, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 The record reflects that the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal on February 6, 2002, and the respondent first filed a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances on January 5, 2006.¿FN1º Therefore the respondent failed to file her motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the serious illness of the respondent’s grandfather does not qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, as the respondent’s grandfather did not qualify as an “immediate relative.” The respondent also failed to exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen her removal proceedings, even if she had established exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reopen on the basis of her failing to exercise due diligence in trying to reopen her case. In her appellate brief, the respondent conceded that by the time she was able to retain a private attorney, her time to file the motion directly with the Immigration Court had expired. The respondent failed to submit an affidavit setting forth in detail her efforts to reopen her case after receiving the in absentia order of removal in February 2002. In the affidavit submitted with her motion to reopen, the respondent fails to address her efforts to seek legal assistance and actually states that after receiving the in absentia order of removal, she was “in a great amount of grief that left me numb and unable to care for my own affairs.” Therefore, it is unknown exactly when the respondent began to seek legal assistance subsequent to receiving the in absentia order of removal. Moreover, although the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel in her motion to reconsider based on her former counsel’s failure to properly seek reopening of her proceedings, she failed to comply with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).¿FN2º The respondent also claims on appeal that she was unaware of the process required to reopen her case and that she did everything that she was able to do to take care of her situation in Immigration Court, yet there is no indication that the respondent ever contacted the Immigration Court after receiving the in absentia order of removal to determine the proper procedure to seek reopening of her proceedings. Consequently, the respondent failed to establish that she exercised due diligence in seeking to reopen her proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

In its opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) indicates that the respondent filed joint motions to reopen with the Miami Immigration Court on January 5, 2006, January 10, 2006, and January 12, 2006. However, the DHS states that it is their policy and practice to have either the Chief Counsel and/or the office’s Deputy Chief Counsels sign a proposed Joint Motion to Reopen. The DHS asserts that it cannot identify the signatures on behalf of DHS found on the motions. Furthermore, the motions allegedly signed by the DHS contradict the December 12, 2005, letter declining to join in the reopening of these proceedings. See DHS Response to Motion to Reopen.

2

In her appellate brief, the respondent states that her motion to reconsider was not based on ineffective assistance of counsel and she did not comply with the Lozada requirements because counsel was disbarred on February 27, 2006. However, to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent was still required to comply with the requirements of Lozada. Nor did the respondent submit any evidence that her former counsel was disbarred.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wendy Tso, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judged dated January 12, 2006. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec, 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia On October 14, 1999. The respondent failed to file her motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal as is required under Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) and Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act).¿FN1º
 
We find that Cekic v. INS, 435 f3d 167 (2nd Cir. 2006) and Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000) are applicable and support the ruling below. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Cekic v. INS, supra; Iavorski v. INS, supra. An alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period that the alien seeks to toll. Id. Even if the respondent had established ineffective assistance of counsel, the record reflects that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence required for equitable tolling. The affidavits attached to the respondent’s motion to reopen reflect that the respondent discovered the basis for her ineffective assistance of counsel claim against her first attorney the day before her hearing and the day after her hearing, in regards to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against her second attorney. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent had not demonstrated any reasonable basis as to why she waited more than five and a half years longer than allowed by statute to file a motion to reopen. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge and find that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at the hearing on October 14, 1999. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings pursuant to section 242B of the Act. However, as section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act sets forth identical language to that contained in section 242B(c)(3), we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, by analogy.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marshal E. Hyman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark J. Jebson
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 22, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny her request for a continuance to await the processing of her husband’s I-130 petition. The respondent, through new counsel, has filed a motion to reopen based on the same I-130 petition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition. The motion will be denied.
 
A party seeking to reopen removal proceedings must state the new facts she intends to establish, supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b)(3) (2006) INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139 (1981); Matter of Leon-Orosco and Rodriguez-Colas, 19 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 1984; A.G. 1984); Matter of Reyes, 18 I&N Dec. 249 (BIA 1982). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless it establishes a prima facie case of statutory and discretionary eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). A motion is not an opportunity to present previously available arguments, to repeat previously considered and rejected arguments, or to make new or alternative requests for previously available relief.
 
By way of background, the respondent has been seeking adjustment of status based on her marriage in 2000 to a United States citizen, who submitted a second I-130 petition on her behalf in January 2005. Her husband’s first petition had been denied in October 2003. On March 22, 2006, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny her request for a continuance to await the processing of her husband’s second I-130 petition. The respondent indicated that she had filed a motion to reopen the denial of her husband’s first visa petition in November 2003, and that the motion remained pending with Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) at the time of our previous decision. Also on March 22, 2006, we sustained the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for adjustment of status because the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction to decide the motion to reopen after the respondent had filed an appeal with the Board.
 
*2 In the instant motion to reopen, the respondent has obtained new counsel who requests reopening on the basis of “new” evidence submitted to substantiate the bona fides of the marriage. He indicates that the second visa petition submitted by the respondent’s husband remains pending, and that CIS has not rendered a decision on the motion to reopen the first visa petition.¿FN1º The DHS has filed a response in opposition.
 
Upon review, the motion will be denied. We note that the respondent has not satisfied the standards for reopening because she has not established that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. In this regard, we observe that her husband’s visa petition has not been approved, and that the motion to reopen the denial of the first visa petition remains pending with CIS. Furthermore, counsel has attached minimal and insufficient documentation to the motion to establish the bona tides of the marriage.¿FN2º 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b)(3); Matter of Velarde 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). Therefore, the respondent has not satisfied the requirements for reopening under the applicable regulations and precedent. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Finally, to the extent that present counsel alleges in the instant motion that the respondent’s previous attorney committed ineffective assistance of counsel, we observe that the respondent has not attempted to comply in any fashion with the Board’s requirements for making a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

For purposes of completeness, we note that present counsel incorrectly states in his motion that we dismissed both of the respondent’s appeals on March 22, 2006, and that we “did not consider the effect of the new I-130 petition on the proceedings.”

2

In this regard, we observe that counsel has attached to the instant motion a copy of the marriage certificate for the respondent and her husband, an undated letter from a mortgage broker, and photocopies of photographs of what is presumably the respondent and her husband, although counsel has not provided any captions or other identifying information to indicate the names of the individuals depicted in the photographs, or the time and place of the photographs.

APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
This case was last before the Board on March 6, 2006, when we were advised that the respondent was withdrawing his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 19, 2006, decision finding him: removable as charged and ordering him removed from the United States. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 10, 2006, decision denying his motion to reopen his proceedings. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
The record reflects that the respondent in this case was first placed into proceedings in 1999. Those proceedings ended with a grant of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), on April 2, 2001. Subsequently, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) placed the respondent in the instant proceedings with the issuance of a Notice to Appear on July 21, 2005 (Exh. 1). The record reflects that on December 20, 2004, the District Court of Nassau County, New York, determined that the respondent had engaged in conduct that violated a portion of the June 6, 2003, protection order that enjoined the respondent from making credible threats of violence, repeated harassment, or bodily injury against his sister (Exh. 3). As a result, the respondent was found removable under section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii), and was ordered removed from the United States by the Immigration Judge on January 19, 2006.
 
On February 21, 2006, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal with the Board. Three days later, on February 24, 2006, the respondent notified the Board that he was withdrawing his appeal and the Board issued a decision on March 6, 2006, returning the case to the Immigration Court without further action. On the same day that the respondent filed his Notice of Appeal with the Board, he also filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. The respondent claimed that his proceedings should be reopened because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the hands of his former representative, a non-attorney, who he alleged conceded removability on the basis of a conviction that did not trigger removability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act. On April 10, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen noting his failure to notify his prior representative of the charges of ineffective assistance of counsel he was alleging and on the basis that the respondent’s conviction does indeed render him removable under section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act. On April 24, 2006, the respondent filed the instant appeal claiming that he is not removable as charged, that the Immigration Judge failed to advise him of his eligibility for voluntary departure resulting in a due process violation, and that he was under no obligation to notify his prior representative of his complaints.
 
*2 Section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that an alien who has been enjoined under a protective order and who has “engaged in conduct that violates the portion of a protection order that involves protection against credible threats of violence, repeated harassment, or bodily injury to the person or persons for whom the protection order was issued is deportable.” This section applies not only to aliens who have committed an act of violence in violation of a protective order, it also covers actions that “involve” harassing or physically threatening conduct enjoined in the protective order. In this case, we find that the record does not adequately reflect which portion of the protective order the respondent violated. Specifically, we cannot determine from this record Whether the respondent violated the portion of the protection order necessary in order to establish the respondent’s removability as charged or whether he violated the simple “no contact” provision of the protective order. See section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act.¿FN1º
 
However, in regard to the respondent’s arguments regarding voluntary departure, we concur in the Immigration Judge’s decision noting that in order to seek voluntary departure at the commencement of proceedings under section 240B(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), the respondent cannot contest deportability which is exactly what the respondent seeks to do and in order to seek voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act the respondent would have had to show good moral character which he could not since he spent at least 180 days in prison during the past 5 years for criminal convictions that were not on direct appeal. As a result, we find that even if the respondent could establish the failure of the Immigration Judge to advise him of the possibility of voluntary departure, the respondent cannot establish a violation of his due process because he would not have been eligible for the relief.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

Because we fund it necessary to remand the record to the Immigration Judge on the basis of the respondent’s removability, we will not at this time consider the respondent’s argument that he has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Vargas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on January 5, 1996, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s order of deportation. On April 7, 2006, the respondent filed an motion to reopen through which he seeks to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response. The motion to reopen is denied for lack of jurisdiction.
 
In his motion, the respondent admits that it is untimely filed under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and is barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) because he was deported pursuant to the order of removal. He nonetheless argues that the Board has jurisdiction over the instant motion, under the jurisprudence of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, because he was deported in violation of law because the Board’s 1996 order failed to follow existing Board precedent. He also contends that he received ineffective assistance from his prior attorney, Antonio G. Bueno, Esquire, because counsel did not file a motion to reopen requesting a section 212(c) waiver.¿FN1º
 
We have considered the respondent’s arguments regarding our jurisdiction in this case but find them unavailing. Notwithstanding these arguments, we find that we lack jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion. The motion to reopen is not only untimely under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)because it was not filed by September 30, 1996; it is also barred by regulation set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) because it was “made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.”
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied for lack of jurisdiction. Since there is nothing now pending before this Board, the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Micaela M. Alvarez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Janice Montana
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
  
APPLICATION: 212(i) waiver
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the April 1, 2005, decision of the Immigration Judge insofar as she deemed abandoned the respondent’s application for a waiver under section 212(i) of the Act because he failed to timely submit the required supplemental documents. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994) (noting that the adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge in whole or in part is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). On appeal, the respondent’s counsel has alleged that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a request for a continuance to permit the respondent an opportunity to file the required supplemental documents constitutes a denial of due process and deprived the respondent of a fair hearing. In this regard, we observe that the decision to grant or deny a request for a continuance is wholly within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, and the decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of due process. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6 (2006). We are not persuaded by the arguments advanced on appeal that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a request for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion, or that her decision to deny the requested relief was clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i).
 
In addition, counsel maintains on appeal that the respondent’s prior counsel committed ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to file the specified supplemental documents in a timely fashion, and he did not appear in person at the final hearing because of a family emergency (although he did appear telephonically). In this regard, we find that the respondent has not complied with the Board’s requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not notified his prior counsel about his allegations, and he has not filed a complaint with the appropriate state bar against his prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1 st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 Finally, counsel has submitted new evidence on appeal in the form of some of the missing documents (affidavit of support, and federal tax returns) and he requests reopening to permit the respondent to pursue his waiver application. We observe that our review is a review on the record. See Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). Therefore, we do not consider new evidence submitted on appeal except insofar as is necessary to determine whether a motion to reopen is to be granted. In the instant case, we find that the allegations and submissions on appeal do not meet the requirements for such a motion because the respondent has not established that the documents submitted on appeal were not previously available. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, and the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard E. Esquivel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kuyomars Golparvar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent timely appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 25, 2006, decision. The respondent argues on appeal that his case should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing because he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his prior hearing. The Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) argues that the Immigration Judge’s decision was correct and should be summarily affirmed. The respondent’s request for a remand will be granted.
 
The respondent claims that his former counsel erred by admitting factual allegations on the Notice to Appear that the respondent had not committed. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An alien must also show that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case and that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction under which this case arises, has found, however, that aliens need not strictly adhere to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, especially when there is a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See, e.g., Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
The respondent submitted sufficient evidence with his brief to establish compliance with the basic Matter of Lozada requirements. In order to present a successful motion based upon prior ineffective assistance of counsel, however, the respondent must also show that he suffered prejudice. As described above, the respondent claims that he suffered prejudice because his prior attorney erroneously admitted factual allegations on the Notice to Appear, which resulted in the Immigration Judge finding that the respondent is removable as charged. The Immigration Judge’s decision indeed reveals that the Immigration Judge would not have sustained the charge of removability had the respondent’s former attorney not admitted allegations 6 and 7 in their entireties (I.J. at 3).
 
*2 Inasmuch as the respondent has submitted evidence establishing that he may not be removable as charged, we will find that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of his former counsel’s ineffective assistance, and will therefore remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge for adjudication of his claim on these new facts.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing order.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond J. Sanders, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas O’Malley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on September 30, 2005, when we adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on October 28, 2004.¿FN1º On April 10, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming that he received ineffective assistance from his three former attorneys and was prejudiced thereby thus warranting the reopening of proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition to the motion. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Marshall Hong, Esquire, who did not advise him of the consequences of failing to appear at his October 28, 2004, hearing after he informed counsel that he would miss his hearing because he was traveling to Texas to visit a close family friend who was dying. He states that he informed counsel two days before his hearing of the status of his friend and was told that counsel would seek a continuance and informed that it would be okay to miss the hearing since it was only a master calendar hearing and the respondent had an approved employment petition and pending adjustment of status application. The respondent states that after listening to the transcript of his hearing, he learned that counsel did not inform the Immigration Judge of the reasons for the respondent’s failure to appear or of his advice to the respondent to visit his friend rather than appear for his hearing. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge’s statement that counsel informed him to do what was necessary so as to attend his hearing was incorrect as counsel had not so advised him. The respondent also contends that Mr. Hong promptly informed him of the in absentia order and stated that he would file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge but had not done so two months after the entry of the in absentia order.
 
The respondent also argues that he received ineffective assistance from Alexandra D. Baranyk, Esquire, and Susan Fortino-Brown, Esquire, who represented him on his motion to reopen which was filed with the Immigration Judge, because they did not raise the issue of the ineffectiveness of his former counsel in the motion to reopen. He asserts that this error resulted in the Board’s noting in its dismissal of his appeal that he had not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. He contends that these attorneys informed him in October 2005 that they would not continue to represent him whereupon he sought additional counsel but was unable to find counsel until retaining present counsel.
 
*2 The motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of our decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Therefore, we next examine whether the respondent’s motion is subject to the equitable tolling doctrine. See Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488, 490 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that equitable tolling for untimely motions is available where an alien was ordered removed in absentia where the alien establishes that he or she filed the motion within a reasonable time). We find that the respondent has shown that he exercised due diligence regarding his claim against Mr. Hong. He sought and obtained new counsel, Ms. Baranyk, who filed a motion to reopen and appeal on his behalf. He states that between October 2005 when she ceased to represent him, that he sought out additional representation but was turned down by three attorneys until present counsel agreed to represent him regarding the actions of Mr. Hong, Ms. Baranyk, and Ms. Fortino-Brown, and then filed the instant motion in April 2006. Having established that equitable tolling of the time limits for the filing of motions to reopen is applicable in this case, we next turn to the merits of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
The respondent has not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not provided copies of his representation agreement with any of the attorneys who are the subject of his present motion. Thus, we cannot ascertain the scope of the work that each was to perform. This is important in the case of Mr. Hong because we do not know if he was retained to file a motion to reopen. All that we know is that he said that he could file one but didn’t — whether this failure was due to ineffectiveness or because he had not been retained to do so cannot be determined from the record. The absence of a representation agreement with Ms. Baranyk and Ms. Fortino-Brown would help the Board to determine who was responsible for the respondent’s case. Ms. Branayk is represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge and the Board whereas Ms. Fortino-Brown never entered an appearance before either the Immigration Judge or the Board. The respondent states that he met with both women at his initial meeting but the absence of a notice of appearance or any filings from Ms. Fortino-Brown makes her role in the respondent’s case almost impossible to ascertain absent a retainer agreement which sets forth her role and obligations towards the respondent.
 
In addition, although the respondent provided evidence showing that he filed complaints against Mr. Hong, Ms. Baranyk, and Ms. Fortino-Brown with the Illinois state bar disciplinary authorities, he has not provided any evidence showing that he informed each of those attorneys of his complaint. Although counsel for the respondent states that a copy of the complaint was sent to each attorney (Resp. Mot. at 8), statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). As the respondent has submitted no evidence showing that the three attorneys were advised of his complaint, we have no evidence establishing that they are aware of the ineffective assistance claim that he is making against them in his removal proceedings. They have therefore not been provided with a meaningful opportunity to respond. Because the respondent has not complied with the Lozada requirements, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
*3 The respondent also requests that we reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order sua sponte. We decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Grisel Ybarra, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of Status
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s February 23, 2005, decision pretermitting the respondent’s application for adjustment of status Pursuant to section 202 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA), Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, based on her failure to file required evidence supporting that application in a timely manner.
 
Applications for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act are properly denied as abandoned when the applicant fails to file required evidence by court-imposed deadlines. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (2005); Matter of Shanu, 23 I&N Dec. 754, 764 (BIA 2005). As an applicant for adjustment of status under NACARA § 202, the respondent was obliged to file evidence in Immigration Court proving that she had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period beginning not later than December 1, 1995. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.13(a)(2). Moreover, pursuant to Rule 2.D of the Revised Local Operating Procedures of the Miami Immigration Court, such evidence was required to be filed at least 10 days in advance of the respondent’s individual calendar hearing, so that the court and government counsel could have a reasonable opportunity to review it before the merits hearing. See Matter of Shanu, supra, at 765 & n.8. Yet the respondent neither filed the evidence by the deadline nor made a timely request for an extension. Instead, she simply appeared in court on the date of her individual calendar hearing and attempted to have the exhibits placed into evidence at that time. When the Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s attorney why the documents were not filed in compliance with the 10-day rule, her only response was that her office did not have the evidence ready by that deadline. (Tr. at 6).
 
Under the circumstances, we conclude that the Immigration Judge acted within the scope of his discretion when he deemed the respondent’s application for NACARA adjustment abandoned. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The respondent has not argued that her default was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, see generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and therefore we have no present occasion to express an opinion with respect to that issue.
 
*2 The appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a male native and citizen of Cuba who was placed in removal proceedings through the filing of a Notice to Appear with the Immigration Court on March 7, 2005. In a decision dated July 14, 2005, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia after failing to appear for his scheduled hearing. On August 2, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order claiming that he did not receive notice of the hearing date and advising that he was eligible to adjust his status under the Cuban Adjustment Act. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a response in opposition to the motion. In a written decision dated August 12, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion after finding that the hearing notice was mailed to counsel at counsel’s address of record.
 
On August 18, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen rebuttal and the next day filed a motion to reconsider.1 In the motion to reconsider, counsel admits receiving the hearing notice, stated that she sent the hearing notice to the respondent who did not receive it, and advised that the respondent has trouble receiving mail because he is not the primary person who resides at his address. In a written decision dated August 23, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. In a decision dated December 28, 2005, the Board affirmed and adopted the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reconsider.
 
On April 25, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board through which he seeks reopening claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney, Julie E. Lynwander, Esquire. The respondent further requests, in the alternative, that the Board reopen proceedings sua sponte in order to allow him to pursue an application for adjustment of status under the Cuban Adjustment Act.2 The respondent also seeks a stay of removal pending our decision on the current motion. The DHS has filed no response to the instant motion
 
Ms. Lynwander has filed a response to the respondent’s allegations in which she details her actions regarding the respondent’s case, disputes the facts, and denies acting in a manner other than that of good faith and diligence. She also advises that she continues to personally represent members of the respondent’s family, including his wife, in other immigration matters. We find that the respondent’s former counsel, Julie Lynwander, did not provide the respondent with ineffective assistance. However, we find that the reopening of proceedings in warranted under the specific circumstances presented in this case and will therefore reopen proceedings sua sponte, see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Haying reopened proceedings, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s removal proceedings are reopened sua sponte.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

The motion to reopen rebuttal was apparently intended as a reply to the DHS’s response in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind but crossed in the mailed with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen.

In his conclusion, the respondent states that he wants to apply for relief upon remand to the USCIS. We lack authority to remand a removal case to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), which is not a party to the instant proceedings, although it is an agency of the DHS. The remand of a removal case would be to an Immigration Judge where the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would be the opposing party representing the DHS.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret Rosenast
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 23, 2006. In her motion the respondent avers that her former representative afforded her ineffective assistance of counsel as she failed to apply for relief pursuant to Virk v. INS, 295 F.3d 1055 (9th Cir. 2002), “which would have allowed the alien to continue to reside lawfully in the United States” (Motion at 4). She also argues that counsel erred by appealing the denial of the visa petition filed on her behalf to this Board, and not the Administrative Appeals Unit of the Department of Homeland Security. While the respondent concedes that she has not complied with all the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), she essentially maintains that she need not file a bar complaint against former counsel as she has “substantially complied” with the same per Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), although she has not identified how she has “complied” with the relevant requirements, other than merely setting forth her claim.
 
We recognize in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, the factors enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra, “are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F. 3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Noncompliance with Matter of Lozada may be excused where “both … an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and … the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra at 526.
 
However, we do not find that such a situation is presented here. As noted, the respondent cites Virk v. INS, supra, as establishing that she had a right to remain in the United States that her former counsel failed to exercise. However, that decision does not stand for that proposition. In Virk v. INS, the respondent’s claim was before the Board on a motion to reopen, not a direct appeal, unlike the respondent’s situation. As such, different standards and burdens of proof were applicable. Moreover, that case stands for the proposition that the denial of a motion to reopen should be remanded if the BIA has not considered all relevant factors. See, e.g., Virk v. INS, supra at 1060 (remanding where the Board did not consider factors in petitioner’s favor, and where it considered an irrelevant factor). Finally, as DHS counsel notes in her opposition, the facts in that case were wholly different from that of the respondent. Unlike the alien in that case, the respondent has not already obtained lawful permanent resident status. Moreover, the respondent is ineligible for the waiver she seeks as she was not admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident and the fraud that was committed was not pursuant to her admission at that time. See section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Thus, we are unable to ascertain the relevancy of this case, and find no evidence of ineffective counsel in this regard.
 
*2 We also find perplexing and unavailing the respondent’s arguments alleging that her counsel erred by “improperly appeal[ing] the denial of the I-130 petition filed by the second spouse to the BIA, rather than to the Administrative Appeals Unit” (Motion, memo. at 2). During the proceedings below the respondent sought only a continuance pending the appeal of the denial of a visa petition filed on her behalf (Tr. at 2-3). It appears that the appeal of this decision was pending before the Board (Tr. at 3). In fact, the respondent recently submitted a copy of her former counsel’s rebuttal to her allegations of ineffective assistance. The attorney reported that, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)(2), she correctly submitted an appeal of the denial of the visa petition filed on her behalf with this Board, accompanied by a motion and memorandum. The record also corroborates the attorney’s refutation of the respondent’s claim that she failed to address the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion for a continuance. Rather, the first issue addressed in the respondent’s brief on appeal submitted by former counsel is whether the Immigration Judge erred in denying the requested continuance (Respondent’s Br. at 1; Motion, memo. at 2). As such, the respondent’s allegations of error in this regard are baseless. In light of the noted defects in the respondent’s motion, she was not exempt from complying with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra at 526. Given the procedural and substantive deficiencies in the respondent’s motion, reopening is not warranted. Id.; 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c).
 
Finally, we note that the respondent references unspecified “significant new and material information” that was not previously unavailable and which related to relief from removal (Motion at 1-2). However, she has not identified either what evidence she wishes to submit, or what relief for which she is eligible. Therefore, reopening on this basis is not appropriate.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Imdad A. Seehar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Erica J. McGuirk
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand; adjustment of status
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on February 2, 2006, when we dismissed, without separate opinion, the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his application for voluntary departure and request for adjustment of status through his United States citizen wife. The record is remanded further proceedings and entry of a new decision.
 
The respondent moved to reopen and remand the case for adjustment of status arguing that his prior counsel incorrectly informed the Immigration Judge on December 22, 2004, that his visa petition had been denied and asserts that this error prejudiced his claim and constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. In the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, the DHS indicated that it confirmed the respondent’s visa petition has not been finally denied and that Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) had thus far only issued a Notice of Intent to Deny dated November 5, 2004. The DHS argued that the respondent represented in his motion that his wife, the petitioner, filed a response to the Notice of Intent to Deny, however, he failed to attach proof of service of these documents on CIS. DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion at 2. The DHS asserted that given the current posture of the respondent’s visa petition application, he has not demonstrated that it is likely to be approved and thus he has not shown that he is likely to be eligible for adjustment of status. Id.
 
The record shows that the respondent’s prior counsel informed the Immigration Court that the respondent’s 1-130 visa application had been denied (Tr. at 17). Based on the Notice of Intent to Deny (Exh. 2) and the respondent’s former counsel’s inaccurate statement that the visa petition had been denied, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was ineligible to adjust his status and for voluntary departure because he entered into a fraudulent marriage and cannot show good moral character during the required period (Exh. 2). See I.J. at 2-3. The respondent supported his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with affidavits, provided prior counsel notice and opportunity to respond to the allegation levied against him, and the respondent filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 638 (BIA 1988). The misstatement by the respondent’s prior counsel was prejudicial to the respondent’s case and constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004) (to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, alien must demonstrate counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir.2001) (same). Where the Immigration Judge’s decision is based on materially inaccurate information provided by the respondent’s prior counsel, ineffective assistance of counsel is shown and we will remand the case for further proceedings, updated factual findings, and entry of a new decision. Accordingly, the record is remanded for further proceedings to consider the respondent’s applications for adjustment of status and voluntary departure. Although we find it appropriate to issue an order remanding the record, we take no position on the ultimate merits of the respondent’s future applications for relief.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is hereby granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

File: AXX XX9 372 - Eloy

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John M. Pope, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kuyomars Golparvar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; voluntary departure
 
In a decision dated March 27, 2006, an Immigration Judge sustained the charge of deportability against the respondent, pretermitted his applications for relief from removal on grounds of abandonment, and ordered him removed from the United States. On April 21, 2006, the respondent moved to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b), but the Immigration Judge denied the motion in a decision dated April 26, 2006. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained, the removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, is removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), on the basis of his April 2005 California conviction for possession of cocaine base.1 During his proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent requested an opportunity to apply for relief from removal in the form of cancellation of removal and voluntary departure under sections 240A(a) and 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(a) and 1229c(b). However, the respondent’s former attorney—Joseph Siguenza, Esquire—failed to file the applications for relief by the court-imposed deadline of March 13, 2006. Consequently, the applications were deemed abandoned pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) and the respondent was ordered removed as charged on March 27, 2006.
 
The respondent, represented by new counsel, filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge requesting an opportunity to file his relief applications out of time and alleging that attorney Siguenza may have provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to file the applications in a timely manner. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, holding that the respondent’s allegations did not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the respondent had not demonstrated prejudice arising from his default. The respondent appeals, arguing that attorney Siguenza’s unexplained failure to file the respondent’s relief applications in a timely manner was ineffective assistance on its face that prejudiced the respondent by depriving him of an opportunity of securing relief that would have allowed him to remain in the United States.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held on numerous occasions that an attorney’s unexplained failure to meet a client’s mandatory filing deadlines constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel where the failure to file results in a default, essentially forfeiting the client’s opportunity to pursue avenues of relief that would otherwise have been open to him. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 900-01 (9th Cir. 2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002); Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1044-45 (9th Cir. 2000); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that such untimely filing—when inadequately explained—constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel on its face, so as to warrant reopening despite the respondent’s failure to comply with the formal procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, supra, at 1226-27; Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 526-27.
 
In this instance, it is evident from the face of the record that attorney Siguenza did not attempt to file the respondent’s applications for relief until March 22, 2006, some nine days after the court-imposed deadline of March 13, 2006. Moreover, although attorney Siguenza explained that his failure to file the applications in a timely manner was due to the pressures of his workload, time-management problems or an overextended practice cannot justify defective representation. Finally, the untimeliness of the applications obviously prejudiced the respondent by causing him to forfeit his right to seek relief for which he was prima facie eligible. Under the circumstances, we agree with the respondent that attorney Siguenza provided ineffective assistance of counsel that compromised respondent’s right to a full and fair hearing. The appropriate remedy in such a case is to reopen the removal proceedings so that the respondent may have an opportunity to apply for the relief which he would have requested but for Siguenza’s default.
 
On remand, the respondent should be given an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act. We note, however, that his conviction for possession of cocaine base may well trigger the aggravated felony bar of section 240A(a)(3) and the good moral character bar of section 240B(b)(1)(B) of the Act. See also section 101(f)(8) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(8) (indicating that an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is precluded from establishing good moral character). In this connection, we note that possession of a mixture or substance containing more than 5 grams of cocaine base is a felony under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), and therefore a state conviction for such an offense would qualify as an aggravated felony for immigration purposes under the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 356 F.3d 1015 (9th Cir. 2004). Because the evidence indicates that the aforementioned grounds of mandatory denial may apply to the respondent, he shall have the burden on remand of proving that his crime does not constitute an aggravated felony. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The Government need not prove that it does.
 
*3 The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen is vacated, and the removal proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

Before the Immigration Judge, the respondent invoked Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, 222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir. 2000), and argued that this conviction did not render him removable. The Immigration Judge rejected the respondent’s challenge to the charge of removability, however, relying on the Ninth Circuit’s subsequent decision in Chavez-Perez v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1284 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent has not appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision sustaining the charge of deportability, nor has he challenged that deportability finding in connection with his motion to reopen. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is now final with respect to the deportability issue.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nikki Jacobson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Mubaraki
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)] - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Termination; voluntary departure
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
To the extent that the respondent contends on appeal that she informed her former counsel that her testimony to immigration officials at the border was coerced or involuntary and that her former counsel nevertheless failed to present evidence to rebut the allegations against her, the respondent has not attempted to meet the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); see generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Furthermore, we reject the respondent’s contention on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have fully developed the record on the issue of coercion and that the Immigration Judge did not allow her to present evidence on her own behalf. The respondent in this case was represented by counsel. At the respondent’s November 17, 2005, hearing, counsel for the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), stated that the respondent’s counsel informed him that the respondent was not going forward on the assertion that her statement to immigration officials was involuntary. See Tr. at 24-25. The respondent’s counsel did not dispute this statement. Moreover, after the DHS rested on the evidence presented, the Immigration Judge specifically inquired as to whether the respondent’s counsel wished to call any witnesses to rebut the DHS’s evidence, to which the respondent’s counsel replied that he did not. See Tr. at 25. In the face of these statements, we do not find that the Immigration Judge was required to further develop the record on the issue of coercion or that the Immigration Judge otherwise conducted proceedings in a manner that deprived the respondent of a full and fair hearing.
 
Additionally, as the respondent has not asserted that she is eligible for any form of relief from removal, we reject the respondent’s contention that she was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s failure to explain the standard of proof for any available forms of relief. Moreover, we note that the respondent’s counsel agreed that the respondent was ineligible for relief under section 240A(a) of the Immigration Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and indicated that the respondent did not wish to pursue any other form of relief from removal. See Tr. at 27-28.
 
*2 Finally, to the extent that the respondent requests voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), for the first time on appeal, the respondent’s request will be denied. The respondent is ineligible for voluntary departure in that she has been found to be a member of a class of persons described in section 212(a)(6)(E) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E), and is thus prevented from establishing that she has been a person of good moral character during the last 5 years. See sections 101(a)(f)(3) and 240B(b)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(f)(3), 1229c(b)(1)(B).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: BISHAN HUANG
File: AXX XX5 453 - New York

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alisa Kaufman, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a citizen of the People’s Republic of China, received Notice of Hearing by certified mail that her deportation hearing would be held before an Immigration Judge on October 21, 1994. She did not appear for the hearing, and the Immigration Judge ordered her deportation in absentia. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on September 21, 2005. Therein, she argued that an immigration consultant advised her that it was unnecessary for her to appear for her hearing, and alleged that reopening was appropriate because the respondent was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on October 12, 2005, and the respondent did not appeal that ruling to the Board. On November 4, 2005, the respondent filed with the Immigration Judge a motion entitled Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider and Reopen Sua Sponte. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 13, 2005, and this appeal followed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened because she was the victim of ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant who negligently advised her to not appear for her hearing. A request for rescission of an order of deportation based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation. See section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252B(c)(3)(A). Because a request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of deportation, it is barred from consideration. In addition, an individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that she has acted with due diligence. Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267, 268 (2d Cir. 2006); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 127, 134-35. (2d Cir. 2000)(any equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf).
 
The respondent indicates in her declaration filed with her second motion that she was aware of her hearing, but did not know until August 11, 2003, that she was ordered deported in absentia. Even if the Board tolled the 180-day period for reopening until August 11, 2003, the respondent waited until September 21, 2005, to file her first motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. That request was filed more than 180 days after the respondent was aware that she was ordered deported in absentia, and it is untimely.
 
*2 In reaching our decision, we have also considered the respondent’s numerous arguments raised on appeal. The respondent argues that her attorney who filed her first motion to reopen was negligent because the respondent’s affidavit was not supplied therewith. However, we cannot find that such prejudiced the respondent because the motion was untimely. Zheng v. United States Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2005) (an alien must show that counsel’s performance was so ineffective as to have impinged on the fundamental fairness of the proceedings). The respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider that the respondent is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. However, the respondent’s request for reopening based on adjustment of status is untimely. Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). We further find no evidence that the Immigration Judge rendered a legal conclusion that the respondent filed a frivolous application for asylum under section 208(d)(6) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: RODNEY ALFRED BUSTILLO
File: AXX XX5 551 - Boston

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted aggravated felony
Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on October 18, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On May 12, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The respondent motion to reopen is time and number barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened). The final administrative order in this case was entered on October 13, 2004, when we sustained the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) appeal, vacated the Immigration Judge’s May 27, 2004, decision granting the respondent relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), and ordered the respondent deported to Honduras.
 
The instant motion to reopen is premised on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel by two attorneys who allegedly represented the respondent, Ms. Kerry Doyle and Mr. George Babcock. The respondent’s motion is supported by letters he received from these two attorneys in 2004. Although the respondent has not provided the letters he sent to Ms. Doyle and Mr. Babcock, both these attorneys challenge allegations the respondent apparently made. The respondent has not provided a detailed statement of their alleged misconduct. Rather, he makes generalized assertions that they did not file briefs with this Board. Ms. Doyle states that she did not represent the respondent. Indeed, there is no notice of appearance filed by Ms. Doyle in this case. Regarding Mr. Babcock he entered his appearance as attorney when he filed a motion to reopen on behalf of the respondent. The respondent has not established that he filed a bar complaint against either of these attorneys. Thus, the respondent’s motion will also be denied based on his failure to comply with the procedures we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Additionally, even if the motions filing deadline could be equitably tolled, the respondent has failed to exercise due diligence in asserting his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. In Cai Xing Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151 (1st Cir. 2005), the First Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this ease arises, held that the Board correctly found the alien’s second motion to reopen, and first to raise the ineffective assistance claim, to be number barred but then stated that it has identified five factors to be used when evaluating equitably tolling for an ineffective assistance claim: “(1) a lack of actual notice of a time limit: (2) a lack of constructive notice of a time limit; (3) diligence in the pursuit of one’s rights: (4) an absence of prejudice to a party opponent; and (5) the claimant’s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the time limit.” Id. at 154. As noted above, the respondent offers no reason why he could not have raised these claims in his first motion to reopen. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Noemi G. Ramirez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondents move the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The motion is denied.
 
The respondents’ motion is barred by the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The regulations provide that a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision is rendered and that a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Immigration Judge or the Board. Id. In this case, the Immigration Judge rendered the final administrative decision in the respondents’ proceedings on June 6, 2005. The respondents’ motion to reopen, however, was not filed until May 4, 2006. Moreover, the respondents filed a prior motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge on August 8, 2005, which was denied on November 3, 2005.
 
Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”) has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to toll the time limitation for motions to reopen during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing a motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error, we do not find that the doctrine applies in the case at hand. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). The respondents in the present matter have failed to substantially comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Specifically, the respondents’ motion is not accompanied by a detailed affidavit describing their agreement with counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Moreover, the respondents have failed to establish whether a complaint has been filed against counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authority, and if not, why not. Id.
 
*2 We observe that the attorney representing the respondents in their present motion is the same attorney against whom the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is made. We note that attorneys raising claims relating to their own ineffectiveness are not exempt from the reporting requirement set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See generally Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that attorney who had self-reported his own alleged ineffectiveness demonstrated that counsel had taken his error in failing to file an appeal brief as a serious breach of the services he had promised to alien client). The purpose of the reporting requirement is to highlight the standards which are expected of attorneys appearing before the Board and the Immigration Courts, while underscoring that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should reflect the serious nature of such allegations. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 825.
 
Furthermore, the respondents have failed to establish that they were prejudiced by the actions of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556. Although the respondents generally assert that counsel erred in failing to file their prior motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge before the expiration of their voluntary departure period, the respondents have not articulated any harm or prejudice that resulted from counsel’s late-filing. As we indicated in the second paragraph of our March 31, 2006, decision, the respondents were not eligible for the form of relief sought in their prior motion regardless of the date that the motion was filed. Moreover, the respondents have not asserted that they are presently eligible for any such relief.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Although titled as a “motion to reconsider,” the respondent’s motion is, in substance, a motion to reopen and has been adjudicated in accordance with the regulations governing such motions.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Erich C. Straub, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas O’Malley,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in light of her conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and denied her request for a continuance in order to allow her to pursue post-conviction relief. On appeal the respondent has submitted evidence showing that on July 5, 2005, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (“Court”) issued an order vacating the respondent’s above-noted January 2002 conviction. In doing so, the Court found that the respondent had been deprived of her Sixth Amendment rights as she was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has asked that we remand this case for further consideration in light of this order, while the respondent asks that the proceedings be terminated. However, the conviction which formed the sole basis for the charges of removability has been vacated “on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.” See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003); Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000). As such, his conviction can no longer support the charges of removability. Accordingly, the appeal is sustained and the proceedings in this case are terminated.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
Although the respondent’s motion is both untimely and numerically barred, the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances in his case warrant an exercise of this Board’s limited discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See, e.g., Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Under the circumstances presented in this record, we agree. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding an individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence); see also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that respondent’s second motion should not be barred because the first motion was filed late due to ineffective assistance of counsel). While we express no opinion as to the ultimate merits of the respondent’s claim, we will grant the motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Johnson, Wade, Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 22, 2006, in which we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand. The respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is eligible as a matter of law for the relief sought upon reopening and that such relief would likely be granted in the exercise of discretion. Matter of Rodriguez-Vera, 17 I & N Dec. 105 (BIA 1979). A party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). That burden has not been met. The respondent has failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for relief. The evidence presented was available previously and is not new. The respondent has also not submitted proof of an approved visa petition.1 The respondent further appears ineligible for adjustment of status under §240B(d), because he did not comply with the Board’s last order granting 60 days voluntary departure.2 As the respondent’s motion is not supported by evidence of prima facie eligibility for relief, it will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent also suggests ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. However, he has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must layout, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

1

The respondent’s motion reflects that DHS previously denied his current spouse’s I-130 under §204(c), based upon a finding of fraud in a prior marriage. Thus, he does not have an immigrant visa immediately available to him, and the indication in the Form I-485 (submitted with the motion) that a visa petition was approved is incorrect.

2

Pursuant section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure, and who has been provided written notice of the consequences of remaining in the United States, is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief. We find that the respondent is barred from applying for adjustment of status by section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). An alien who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure is statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief. Therefore, because the respondent has remained in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, the respondent is now statutorily ineligible for the relief sought.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barry Frager, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard Averwater,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeared before an Immigration Judge on January 3, 2006. At the hearing, he was granted until March 6, 2006, to voluntarily depart the United States, and was informed of the requirement to post a 500 dollar bond with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, by February 2, 2006. On February 3, 2006, the DHS determined that the respondent was subject to a final order of removal because the voluntary departure bond was not posted. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on March 3, 2006. Therein, the respondent indicated that he tried to post his bond, but was unable to do so because he apparently did not understand the procedure for posting it. The respondent requested the Immigration Judge to reissue his decision to allow the respondent another opportunity to satisfy his voluntary departure obligation. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, and the respondent appeals that ruling to the Board.
  
Both the statute and the regulation refer to the voluntary departure bond as being a measure to ensure that the alien will depart, with the regulation adding that the bond should ensure that the alien will depart “within the time specified.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(3). The regulations further specify that if an alien does not post a bond within 5 business days of the Immigration Judge’s order granting voluntary departure, “the voluntary departure order shall vacate automatically and the alternate order of removal will take affect on the following day.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3). Consequently, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to a final order of removal because the voluntary departure bond was not posted with the DHS.
  
We further find no error by the Immigration Judge to refrain from reissuing his January 3, 2006, decision. When similar requests come to the Board, it is our policy to disturb the finality of our decisions by means of reissuance only where some administrative error at the Board has resulted in a defect of service which, if not corrected, would prevent a party from perfecting a timely appeal or complying with a voluntary departure deadline. See generally Roy v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 132, 135-36 (5th Cir. 2004). In some cases, moreover, we have reissued decisions in order to remedy a lack of notice arising from the ineffective assistance of an alien’s counsel of record, i.e., where the alien’s attorney received notice of our decision but failed to inform the alien of such receipt until after the relevant filing deadline had passed. As with any other power of this Board, however, our authority to reissue decisions cannot extend beyond the scope of our appellate jurisdiction, as defined by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b). Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991). Thus, an implicit qualification on our power to reissue a decision is that such reissuance be necessary to safeguard the fairness of a proceeding over which we have jurisdiction.
  
The present respondent has not shown that his difficulty in posting his voluntary departure is a result of any administrative error on the part of the Immigration Judge or the Immigration Court. The respondent also states in his brief that he is not challenging his attorney’s performance based on ineffective assistance of counsel (See respondent’s brief at 3). His difficulty in posting his bond is unfortunate, but is not a ground for the Board to rule that the Immigration Judge erred by not vacating his earlier decision in order to reissue it. See Matter of Correa-Garces, 20 I&N Dec. 451 (BIA 1992) (an Immigration Judge has no authority to extend appeal periods beyond what is authorized in regulations). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed..
  
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandra Greene, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopen and reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves to reopen and reconsider our decision dated April 27, 2006, dismissing his appeal from an Immigration Judge’s November 30, 2005, order of removal against him. The respondent contends that on May 11, 2006, his 2001 conviction for marijuana possession was vacated. However, the respondent has only submitted a rather poor quality copy of a court document that apparently does not on its face establish that the conviction was vacated. Even assuming that the conviction was vacated, the respondent has not presented evidence demonstrating whether his plea of guilty was vacated for “reasons solely related to rehabilitation or immigration hardships” or “on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.” See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). Concerning the motion to reconsider, the respondent has failed to establish that we erred in dismissing his appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent is merely reiterating contentions considered previously. The respondent does take issue with the assertion in our last decision that we found that his numerous filings before the Immigration Judge bordered on frivolous, and that none of the Immigration Judge’s rulings contained error within our standard of review. We found that the respondent’s motion for recusal included widespread, far-reaching allegations of misconduct involving alleged incidents wholly unsupported by the record, and even less germane to the issues related to the instant case. The respondent argues that a three member decision which dismissed his bond appeal on April 27, 2006, referred present counsel’s complaints and her factual statements to this agency’s office of General Counsel for further investigation. Even in the bond decision, however, we found that the evidence of record did not support the respondent’s complaint against the Immigration Judge. The respondent has also attached letters which appear to indicate that he considers himself to be a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but he has not filed such a motion or complied with the procedural requirements, see Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard David Rogen, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated January 17, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen an order of deportation entered in absentia on September 27, 1989. The respondent appeals that ruling to the Board. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent appeared before an Immigration Judge on April 3, 1989, conceded deportability, and was scheduled to appear for a hearing on September 27, 1989, for possible section 212(c) consideration. The respondent did not appear, and was ordered deported from the United States. The respondent did not appeal that decision, and was deported from this country on July 16, 1990. The respondent illegally reentered the United States, and filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on November 22, 2005. Therein, the respondent argues that his prior counsel instructed him not to appear for his September 27, 1989, hearing because the Immigration Judge was going to reschedule it. The respondent further argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and had reasonable cause for his failure to appear.
 
The initial issue is whether the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to reopen. The regulations state that a motion to reopen shall not be made subsequent to an alien’s departure from the country. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d); 1003.23(b) (2005); see also Matter of Palma, 14 I&N Dec. 486 (BIA 1973) (there are no proceedings to be reopened once a deportation order had been executed); Matter of Wang, 17 I&N Dec. 565, 567 (BIA 1980). However, a deportation based upon an illegally executed order does not foreclose reopening once the respondent has departed the United States. See e.g., Estrada-Rosales v. INS, 645 F.2d 819 (9th Cir. 1981); Mendez v. INS, 563 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1977).
 
In the instant case, we find that the respondent’s deportation was legally executed. The respondent does not deny that he received notice of his hearing, admitted that he was deportable from the United States as charged, and did not appeal his order of deportation. Even assuming that the respondent was told by his former attorney that his case will be rescheduled, that does not render his deportation illegally executed. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan R. Diamante, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on October 13, 1999, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision pretermitting her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen proceedings based upon her claim that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that she was defrauded by an “immigration law expert” who misrepresented herself as an attorney. She explained that she hired this woman to help her adjust status, including the filing of an application for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a), with the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) in August 1997. The respondent was subsequently placed into removal proceedings with the filing of a Notice to Appear in May 1998. Because suspension of deportation was unavailable subsequent to the April 1, 1997, effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), the respondent applied for cancellation of removal despite her inability to demonstrate the requisite 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States. She explained that although she hired the “immigration law expert” to appear on her behalf, she was represented in her removal proceedings by attorneys who were employed by this woman. The respondent noted that she was not pursuing ineffective assistance of counsel claims against these attorneys, but was proceeding solely against the “immigration law expert” because this woman held herself out as the respondent’s attorney, was the only person the respondent consulted with regarding her case, and was paid for all legal services.
 
The respondent maintains that the “immigration law expert” was ineffective, because her actions resulted in the respondent being placed in removal proceedings. This argument is foreclosed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004), amended 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005). In that case, the respondents argued that their former counsel had provided ineffective assistance by advising them to submit an asylum application, and if denied they could seek suspension of deportation, or cancellation or removal. Id. at 971. Instead, due to sweeping changes in immigration law, the respondents became ineligible for both forms of relief. Id. at 971-72.
 
*2 The Ninth Circuit affirmed the Board’s determination that the respondents in Lara-Torres, supra, had not received ineffective assistance of counsel:
Although the Petitioners contend they were denied the opportunity to ‘reasonably present ¿theirº case’ during the removal hearing, their argument in support of that proposition fails. None of ¿their former counsel’sº purported deficiencies pertain to the actual substance of the hearing (e.g., evidence presented or omitted, arguments raised or overlooked), let alone call the hearing’s fairness into question. The basic “unfairness” of which the Petitioners complain is that they never would have been subject to removal proceedings had it not been for their reliance on ¿their former counsel’sº unfortunate immigration-law advice. This “unfairness,” however, did not taint the “fairness” of the hearing … When we have characterized counsel’s assistance as ineffective … the legal services were rendered while proceedings were ongoing; that is, after a charging document was filed.… We reject the Petitioners’ attempt to cast such an expansive and amorphous Fifth Amendment due process right that encompasses legal assistance which does not undermine the fairness of the actual process itself.
 
Id. at 973-75 (emphasis in original).
 
The respondent’s argument fails under the Ninth Circuit’s analysis in Lara-Torres, supra, because she blames her former representative for actions taken prior to the institution of removal proceedings. The respondent makes no allegations of misconduct by her former attorney of record during the course of the removal proceedings. She maintains that this attorney was merely an employee of the woman she hired to represent her, and explained that she decided not to file an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against him because he was unaware that his former employer was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.
 
The Court in Lara-Torres, supra, at 975, explained that if proceedings were reopened based on the respondents’ claims; “nothing would change,” because “if the Petitioners were given a do-over; putting them back in removal proceedings could not result in anything other than their removal.” Similarly here, the respondent admitted that she was removable as charged, and she has been found robe ineligible for the relief sought.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jim Salvator, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald C. O’Hare
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on October 24, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s April 6, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. On March 2, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen again seeking the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is time and number barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened). On November 4, 2004, the Immigration Judge entered a final order in this case. The respondent previously filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on March 17, 2005.
 
Despite the respondent’s assertions to the contrary, he remains statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), because he failed to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified. The respondent seeks to excuse his failure to depart by blaming his prior counsel, Dr. Khanna, and asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Although the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has failed to establish that Dr. Khanna actually prejudiced his case. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent was personally served with the Immigration Judge’s November 4, 2004, decision granting him voluntary departure and warning him about the adverse consequences should he fail to depart. Even if Dr. Khanna misadvised the respondent, the respondent has failed to establish that he was not advised of the privilege of voluntary departure and the consequences of failing to depart.
 
Finally, the respondent’s assertion that he is “stateless” is now moot. The Department of Homeland Security has proffered a copy of the respondent’s recently issued travel document. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Evelyn G. Zneimer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF DHS:
 
Janet Muller
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
Sec. 212(a)(9)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)º - Previously ordered removed at arrival
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated July 19, 2005, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal and pretermitted his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The charges in the respondent’s Notice to Appear (“NTA”) include allegations that the respondent was ordered removed on October 31, 2004, pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (expedited removal), then on November 3, 2004, attempted to elude inspection and gain admission to the United States, and also on November 3, 2004, was paroled into the United States as a material witness for the United States Government (Exh. 1). The respondent, through counsel, admitted the charges in the NTA (Tr. at 8). The respondent sought to apply for cancellation of removal for certain non-permanent residents (Tr. at 9). The Immigration Judge denied him the opportunity to apply for that form of relief on the basis that he was barred from establishing the required good moral character and also could not establish the required 10 years of continuous physical presence (because the prior order of removal terminated his continuous physical presence).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in relying upon his admissions at the hearing as a basis for finding that he was previously removed in 2004 and that he was subject to removal as charged in the NTA. Because the respondent was represented by counsel and his counsel conceded the charges of removability, the Immigration Judge did not err in finding him removable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10. One of the conceded factual allegations in the NTA was that the respondent was the subject of an order of expedited removal in 2004 (Exh. 1). The respondent has never, even in his appeal brief, contested that allegation. Under Matter of Avilez, 23 I&N Dec. 799, 800 (BIA 2005), an order of expedited removal interrupts an alien’s period of continuous physical presence for purposes of his application for cancellation of removal. For that reason, the respondent is not eligible for cancellation of removal. See Tapia v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 997 (9th Cir. 2005) (“To permit an alien who was removed or left pursuant to an administrative voluntary departure to continue to accrue physical presence would thwart Congress’s clear intent that such an alien be inadmissible for years following the date of his departure.”).
 
*2 To the extent that the Immigration Judge also found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal based upon his inability to establish good moral character, we note that the statute relied upon by the Immigration Judge (section 101(f)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(3)) has recently been amended to make a technical correction. Under the corrected version of the statute, the respondent does not fall within the category of aliens who are barred from establishing good moral character.1
 
On appeal, the respondent makes general allegations that his counsel was ineffective. However, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Finally, the respondent suggests on appeal that the Board should grant him some form of humanitarian relief from removal. While we sympathize with the respondent’s situation, the Board has no authority to grant the respondent any relief beyond that for which he is statutorily eligible.
 
The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Howard Hom
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Heith M. Kaneshige,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 24, 2006. The respondent failed to appear for her deportation hearing. On October 18, 1993, an Immigration Judge ordered her to be deported in proceedings conducted in absentia. The respondent appealed. On March 15, 1995, this Board found no jurisdiction over her appeal, and returned the record to the Immigration Judge. On May 30, 1995, an Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had signed the certified mail receipt for the notice of hearing, and that she had not claimed exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. He found no basis for reopening. More than 10 years later, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, and claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge noted that some of the respondent’s statements were not truthful, and that she had not demonstrated that she was prima facie eligible for relief from deportation upon reopening. She found that the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked details, and that her long delay in raising the claim indicated a lack of diligence. The Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth M. Schonfeld, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 1, 2005. On appeal, the respondent alleges he has received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
However, the respondent has failed to identify how his former counsel’s action or inaction negatively affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. The respondent has failed to show that he would not be removable or would be eligible for relief but for the attorney’s action or inaction. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). In addition, though the Bar Association forwarded a copy of the former counsel’s reply to the respondent’s Bar complaint, the respondent has failed to provide it to this Board
 
The respondent was admitted as a lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis on April 16, 2002. He was convicted of using false documents to obtain employment on January 7, 2004, and sentenced to 3 months in jail. At the hearing, the respondent conceded that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within 5 years of admission for which a sentence of 1 year or more could be imposed. The respondent then requested a waiver under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration Judge denied that relief, finding that he had failed to show that his removal would result in extreme hardship to his United States citizen wife or their 3 United States citizen children. The Immigration Judge found insufficient evidence of emotional or financial hardship.
 
On appeal, the respondent has failed to specify what facts his former counsel failed to elicit at the hearing or what documents his former counsel failed to submit for the hearing. Consequently, the respondent has failed to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: AXX XX3 991 - Los Angeles
June 7, 2006
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Esmeralda Alfaro, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, through counsel, has filed a motion to reconsider, and moves the Board to vacate its March 30, 2006, decision dismissing his appeal. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent writes that he did not receive notice of the briefing schedule, and thus was deprived of filing a brief on behalf of his appeal. Present counsel has filed an affidavit denying receipt of the notice of briefing schedule. The administrative record reflects (1) that present counsel filed an EOIR-27 (Notice of Appearance before the Board) and she identified her mailing address as 3701 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1050, Los Angeles, California, 90010; (2) that the receipt for filing the Notice of Appeal was sent to counsel at that designated address; (3) the briefing schedule was sent to counsel at that designated address; (4) the Board’s decision was also sent to counsel at that designated address; and (5) there is no evidence that any of those documents was returned as undeliverable. There is a presumption of regularity that the United States Postal Service properly delivered the Board’s decision to former counsel, and that such delivery is sufficient to constitute adequate notice. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995). However, counsel has overcome the presumption by her detailed affidavit in support of the motion. In Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2002), the court held that deliver by regular mail does not raise the same “strong presumption” as certified mail, and less should be required to rebut such a presumption. Consistent with the discussion in Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540, 544-5 (BIA 2002), which indicated that the presumption of delivery is stronger for certified mail as opposed to regular mail, and Salta, we find that the respondent has overcome the presumption of regular mail delivery. See also Maknojiya v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 588 (5th Cir. 2005); Gounem v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 740 (8th Cir. 2004)
 
However, the respondent has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the failure to file a brief in support of his appeal, in cases such as ineffective assistance of counsel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit finds a presumption of prejudice when counsel fails to file a brief. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814 (9th Cir. 2003). The presumption, however, can be overcome, Id at 826. In the instant case there is no evidence that the Board erred when it sent the briefing schedule notice to counsel even if we assume that counsel did not in fact receive the notice of briefing schedule. In our last decision we considered whether the immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s application for relief under the former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Specifically, we found that the Immigration Judge properly balanced the positive factors of record that are in the respondent’s favor with the respondent’s extensive and adverse criminal record. In particular, we found that the Immigration Judge properly gave significant weight to the violent behavior by this respondent as well as the respondent’s lack of remorse. Upon consideration of the reasons contained in the Immigration Judge’s decision, we found no error in the determination that the respondent was not deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion. In Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 562 (BIA 2003), the Board held that an alien did not establish that his former counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. In Assad we noted that the alien received a fair and complete hearing before the Immigration Judge, he was well represented by counsel throughout the hearing, and was provided every opportunity to present his case for a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act. In the instant case, unlike Assaad, the Board did consider the respondent’s appeal, and specifically considered his contention on the Notice of Appeal regarding the denial of 212(c) relief. However, in his instant motion, the respondent has not made any showing that the Immigration Judge committed error in denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under the former section 212(c) of the Act. Under the circumstances we find that the presumption of prejudice from the failure to file a brief due to nondelivery of the briefing schedule has been overcome by the fact that the Board considered the Immigration Judge’s denial of 212(c) relief, and the fact that the respondent has made no showing of error.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Sandra Greene, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Steven J. Connelly,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated January 3, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the November 1, 2004, motion to reopen that was filed by the respondents, a mother and her two minor children, seeking reopening of proceedings in which an in absentia order was entered on August 18, 2004. The respondents have appealed.
 
We first point out that the August 18, 2004, in absentia order itself did not make factual and legal findings consistent with the requirements of section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), before the in absentia order was entered. Specifically, the order does not make specific findings that proper notice was provided nor does it state that the Department of Homeland Security provided evidence establishing the respondents’ removability under the charge by clear and convincing evidence.
 
Further, the respondents’ motion to reopen, which was filed within the 90-day period that generally applies to motions to reopen, makes an argument that reopening is warranted under Matter of M-S-, 22 l&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), in which we held that the formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied where the respondent has not been orally advised, in a language that he or she understands, of the consequences for failing to appear, and is now eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing. We find that the Immigration Judge failed to adequately address whether reopening under Matter of M-S-, supra, is warranted.
 
The Notice to Appear indicates that the warnings regarding the consequences for failing to appear were provided in the English language. The motion specifically asserts that the respondents do not understand English. The Immigration Judge’s finding to the contrary is conclusory. There is no specific statement on the Form I-213 indicating that the respondents directly communicated with the immigration officials in English. The respondents argue that communications with immigration officers were facilitated by the children’s father, who does speak some English. Further, we recognize, as should the Immigration Judge, that it is common for unrepresented aliens who do not speak English to submit letters and other statements that have been prepared in the English language with the assistance of friends and relatives. The submission of such a letter is not contrary to their assertion that English is not a language that they understand. The filing of a motion in the English language is also not evidence of English proficiency. As discussed below, the motion was not prepared by the respondents.
 
*2 Finally, the respondents argue on appeal that they were ineffectively assisted by counsel. They have provided a copy of their retainer agreement requiring them to pay $4,000 for attorneys to prepare a motion on their behalf, with the proviso that it be filed pro se, without identifying the attorneys as its author. The respondents request an opportunity to perfect a claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondents shall be provided a reasonable time within which to present a proper ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the remanded proceedings.
 
The respondents have provided documents showing that the two minor respondents are the beneficiaries of approved visa petitions. Further, the adult respondent is the beneficiary of a pending visa petition that was filed by her United States citizen father. We note that the adult respondent, in the supplement to the motion, also provided documentation that she is married to a United States citizen.
 
Accordingly, we will remand the record for a new decision, with appropriate fact finding and legal analysis, which addresses the respondents’ claims that reopening is warranted under Matter of M-S-, supra, and/or Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rachel Effron, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has timely filed a motion asking this Board to reconsider our May 2, 2006, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision issued on November 18, 2005. The motion for reconsideration will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
In dismissing the respondent’s appeal on May 2, 2006, we noted that the respondentt failed to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal because the application was not complete. Upon reconsideration, we find that the respondent presented an application which was sufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal.1 While we also noted in our decision that the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent failed to comply with this Board’s framework for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we did not fully address that issue. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion for reconsideration is granted so that this Board may fully address the merits of the respondent’s appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s initial motion because the respondent failed to fully comply with this Board’s framework for proving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, namely, because the respondent did not submit evidence that she had filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary, authorities. Following the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion because the respondent failed to notify the appropriate disciplinary authorities, the respondent filed a motion for reconsideration that included evidence that she had filed a formal complaint with the State Bar.
 
We have held that to satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support her claim by a detailed affidavit, inform her previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not (emphasis added). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Based on the totality of the circumstances, the respondent’s appeal is sustained. The record reveals that the respondent provided a reasonable explanation for not filing a formal complaint, which complies with this Board’s Lozada framework. Moreover, when her motion to reopen was denied for lack of a formal complaint, the respondent exercised due diligence in filing a formal complaint with the State Bar and included evidence that she had filed a complaint with her motion to reconsider. In sum, we find that the respondent sufficiently complied with the framework of Lozada, supra, in showing that she was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel.
*2 ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is granted. This Board’s decision dated May 5, 2006, is vacated.
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 18, 2005, is sustained. Proceedings are ordered reopened and remanded to the Immigration Judge for a merits hearing on the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal.

APPLICATION: Reopening; termination of proceedings
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM: The respondent was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge in a decision dated March 28, 2001. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to reopen in a decision dated October 3, 2001. Both the Immigration Judge and the Board found that the respondent had not derived United States citizenship from his father. On August 13, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen through which he again asserted that he had derived United States citizenship from his father and alleged new evidence obtained by an attorney to support his claim. The Board denied the motion on September 10, 2004, as untimely filed. On April. 17, 2006, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen through which he again asserts that he had derived United States citizenship from his father and again alleges evidence obtained by an attorney to support his claim. The respondent also filed a motion to stay removal which was denied by the Board on May 2, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the motion. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is denied for separate and independent reasons. First, the motion is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s October 3, 2001, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Second, the motion is number-barred because it exceeds the numerical limitations on motions to reopen. Id. Third, the motion is unaccompanied by the alleged “new” evidence from attorney Stacy Caplow as required by regulation: Id.
 
Fourth to the extent that the respondent is alleging that his former attorney, Bonnie Mazur, Esquire, provided ineffective assistance by not presenting the alleged new evidence, the motion does not comply with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Asaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553(BIA 2003).
 
*2 Fifth, the alleged new evidence, should it exist as stated in the respondent’s motion does not support a finding that the respondent received ineffective assistance from Ms. Mazur or that he derived United States citizenship from his father. The respondent contends that Ms. Caplow discovered that in his parent’s divorce decree, the judge found that the respondent’s mother had abandoned the family 3 years prior to the divorce, when the respondent was 16 years of age. He also asserts that his mother executed an affidavit in which she admitted that she abandoned the family on January 15, 1988, and explained her reasons for doing so. These facts do not show that the respondent’s parents were legally separated prior to their divorce or that the respondent’s father had legal custody of the respondent prior to the respondent’s 18th birthday.2 Thus, these facts do not support a finding that the respondent received ineffective assistance from Ms. Mazur since these facts, even if brought out at the respondent’s hearing before the Immigration Judge, does not establish that he derived United States citizenship from his father prior to his 18th birthday. Therefore, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se1
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine E. Halliday-Roberts
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a male native and citizen of El Salvador who was placed in removal proceedings through the filing of a Notice to Appear with the Los Angeles Immigration Court on June 30, 2004. An Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 4, 2005, after the respondent failed to appear at his scheduled hearing. On April 25, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking to rescind the in absentia order. The Immigration Judge denied the motion in a written decision dated June 21, 2005. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. In an order dated October 4, 2005, the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. On May 8, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen through which he seeks reopening of proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former counsel, Early M. Hawkins, Esquire. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition based solely upon the argument that the respondent’s motion is number-barred because the respondent had previously filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. The motion to reopen will be granted.
 
The respondent has not fully complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Although he has provided a translated copy of his legal agreement with Mr. Hawkins and a copy of his complaint to the California state bar, he has not provided evidence showing that he informed Mr. Hawkins of the complaint in order to allow his former attorney an opportunity to respond. The respondent’s letter to former counsel requesting a copy of his file is not a substitute for informing counsel of the specifics of the respondent’s allegations. Likewise, the submission of a complaint to the appropriate state bar disciplinary authorities is insufficient because in such situations, any response from former counsel will be made to the state bar and not to the Board for our consideration in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We expect an alien alleging that he or she has received ineffective assistance of counsel from a prior attorney to inform the attorney of the allegations of ineffectiveness so that the attorney has the opportunity to rebut or explain the allegations. However, the respondent has substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, which is all that is required for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which jurisdiction the present case arises. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 We must now determine whether the respondent’s motion is timely filed and, if not, is subject to equitable tolling. The respondent’s motion is untimely filed because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s October 4, 2005, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion was filed on May 6, 2006, just over 7 months after the Board rendered its decision. However, under the jurisprudence of the Ninth Circuit equitable tolling of the time limits for motions to reopen is available to aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002), and cases cited therein. We find that the respondent has shown that he exercised due diligence as his motion was filed approximately 6 weeks after he was detained by the DHS and learned, upon discussions with his present attorney, of the facts and circumstances of his case.
 
We therefore next examine the merits of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The Ninth Circuit has stated that such inquiry must begin with determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). We find that competent counsel would have acted otherwise. The respondent’s detailed affidavit and supporting documentation, including payment receipts and a copy of the his legal representation contract, establish that Mr. Hawkins provided ineffective assistance. The respondent has shown that virtually all of his legal business, including the preparation of forms and legal documents, with Mr. Hawkins’ firm was conducted through, and by, Mr. Hawkins’ office manager, Jose Coronado Vigil, who is not an attorney. The respondent has shown that his contact with Mr. Hawkins was limited to a handful of occasions during which periods of time no substantive discussions of the respondent’s case took place. The respondent has shown that as a result of Mr. Coronado Vigil’s actions, he failed to appear at his hearing due to inaccurate information received from Mr. Coronado-Vigil. These are not the actions or oversight expected of, or provided by, competent counsel.
 
In examining whether the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s actions, we must determine whether the outcome of the respondents’ case may have been affected. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d at 859. We find that it was. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia because Mr. Hawkins’ office manager informed the respondent, incorrectly, that his Immigration Court hearing date had been changed. Moreover, although the respondent indicates in paragraph 11, page 5 of his affidavit that he did not want asylum (Resp. Mot. at Exh. J), the respondent was deprived of an opportunity to proceed on, or withdraw, his asylum application, establish whether he was eligible for relief from removal, or qualify for the privilege of voluntary departure. Thus, the respondent was prejudiced as a result of Mr. Hawkins’ actions. We therefore find that the reopening of proceedings is warranted in this case because the respondent has met his burden of establishing that he received ineffective assistance from his prior attorney and that such ineffectiveness resulted in prejudice to him.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on his behalf by Rosemary J. Esparza, Esquire. However, Ms. Esparza filed a Notice of Appearance as Attorney before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) rather than the correct Notice of Appearance as Attorney before the Board of Immigration Appeals (Form EOIR-27). Submissions before the Board by an attorney must be accompanied by a completed Form EOIR-27 as required by long-standing regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1292.4 and the Board’s Practice Manual (first issued December 1999). Therefore, for purposes of this decision, the respondent will be considered pro se. A courtesy copy of the Board’s decision will be sent to Ms. Esparza.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Enrique Arevalo, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated March 14, 2006. We find that the respondent’s arguments in support of his motion to reconsider fail to establish material error in our March 14, 2006, decision, denying the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. Although we recognize that our March 14, 2006, decision erroneously indicated in the heading that the respondent was in removal proceedings, instead of deportation proceedings, we note that such error does not affect the untimeliness of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Hence, we find no error in our conclusion that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely.
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent’s motion to reconsider fails to establish error in our conclusion that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances sufficient to warrant reopening pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent seeks reopening in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a form a discretionary relief that was not previously available to the respondent during his deportation proceedings. At the outset, we note that the respondent’s subsequent eligibility for discretionary relief does not establish exceptional circumstances sufficient to excuse the untimeliness of the respondent’s motion. See Matter of J-J-, supra (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
Moreover, contrary to the respondent’s argument in his motion to reconsider, neither section 242B(e)(2)(B) nor 245(i) of the Act permitted the respondent to remain in the United States after expiration of the voluntary departure period. Section 242B(e)(2)(B) of the Act simply provides that the statutory bar to discretionary relief imposed upon an alien who remains in the United States after the expiration of the voluntary departure period does not apply to an alien that does not receive the required oral and written notice of the consequences of the alien’s failure to comply with the voluntary departure order. Even if the respondent did not receive the necessary notice of the consequences of his failure to depart, section 242B(e)(2)(B) of the Act did not permit the respondent to remain in the United States beyond the expiration of his grant of voluntary departure. Similarly, although adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act is available to aliens living in the United States without legal status, the mere availability of adjustment of status to this class of aliens did not permit the respondent to ignore his voluntary departure order and remain in the United States beyond the expiration of his voluntary departure period. Considering the foregoing, we do not find that either section 242B(e)(2)(B) or 245(i) of the Act provided the respondent with authority to remain in the United States beyond the expiration of his voluntary departure period. Therefore, we find that the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances on this basis.
 
*2 In addition, we find no merit to the respondent’s argument that he failed to file a timely motion reopen for adjustment of status based upon the 1998 marriage to his United States citizen wife, because he was waiting for his visa petition to be approved. Considering the statements contained in the respondent’s motion, the respondent would have been unable to file a timely motion to reopen based upon his marriage to his United States citizen wife, inasmuch as the respondent’s wife did not file a visa petition on the respondent’s behalf until more than 90 days after the Board dismissed the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Furthermore, we note that the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are unrelated to the respondent’s request for reopening to pursue his application for adjustment of status and therefore, do not establish a basis for finding exceptional circumstances. In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to establish material error in our prior decision denying the respondent’s untimely motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on April 28, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion for a stay of removal. The respondent has also filed a motion to reopen, which will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as a result of his former attorney’s failure to timely appeal an Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2005, decision finding him ineligible for relief under former Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
The Board has held that satisfying the above procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen, and that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). It is also required that the respondent establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Id. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
In the instant case, the respondent submitted an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his former counsel, and attached a copy of the complaint he filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. While the respondent also submitted a copy of a letter sent to his former attorney advising him that he was in the process of filing a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, he failed to notify his prior counsel of the specific allegations leveled against him. Further, the respondent has failed to establish that he suffered any prejudice due to his former counsel’s actions. See Matter of Assaad, supra; see also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The respondent was represented by his former counsel before the Immigration Judge, and was provided an opportunity to present his claim for section 212(c) relief as provided in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44. Following a review of the evidence, in this case, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was statutorily ineligible for section 212(c) relief to waive his February 1990 drug trafficking conviction, because he illegally returned to the United States following a final order of deportation on July 1, 1996. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2). Nothing presented within the respondent’s motion to reopen or attachments convinces us that he would likely have prevailed on appeal of that determination. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was ineffectively represented or was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Couriel, Gabriel A.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reconsider our decision dated April 03, 2006. In our prior order, we addressed the respondent’s claim that her former attorney failed to provide her change of address to the Department of Homeland Security. We applied the precedent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Dominguez v. U. S. Attorney General, 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002), and found that the Notice to Appear was properly served by mail to the respondent’s last known address which she provided in an application for adjustment of status, and that her motion to reopen was not timely filed. However, the Eleventh Circuit’s treatment of the time requirements for filing a motion to reopen as jurisdictional, even where there has been ineffective assistance of counsel, operates to the respondent’s disadvantage. The respondent has demonstrated that her failure to receive the Notice to Appear was due to her counsel’s ineffective assistance. Our decision in Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001), in which we held that entry of an in absentia order of removal is inappropriate where the record reflects that the alien did not receive, or could not be charged with receiving, the Notice to Appear, is applicable here. We agree that sua sponte reopening of the respondent’s removal proceedings is warranted in this case.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlton L. Hume, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 6, 2006, denial of his motion to reopen. The respondent sought reopening of an order dated January 19, 1999, in which the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), pursuant to a stipulated agreement between the parties requesting voluntary departure in lieu of removal (Exh. 13). The respondent waived appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. On February 24, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen the Immigration Judge’s January 19, 1999, decision based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. In an order dated March 6, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because the respondent had not established any prejudice by the claimed actions, or inactions, of his prior counsel. We now consider the respondent’s appeal of that decision.1
 
The respondent asserts that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s ineffective assistance in three principal ways. First, he asserts that his former counsel failed to file a timely application for cancellation of removal before the Immigration Judge in 1999, despite his eligibility for such relief at that time. However, we note that when the respondent’s prior attorney submitted the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, he also submitted a motion to withdraw as counsel because he alleged that the respondent had refused to communicate and cooperate with him in completing and filing said application, thus causing the application to be untimely filed under the court’s order (Exhs. 7, 8). As such, it is not clear with whom the responsibility lies for the lateness of the filing. In any case, we observe that following the filing of the application for cancellation of removal on January 13, 1999, the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) entered into a stipulated agreement on January 19, 1999, in which the respondent agreed to accept voluntary departure in lieu of removal, and to “withdraw¿º any and all other applications for relief, with prejudice” (Exh. 13). Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that even if the respondent had filed a timely application for cancellation of removal, he does not appear to have been prima facie eligible for such relief in January 1999. In his previous proceedings, the respondent admitted to two Connecticut state convictions for possession of marijuana (Exhs. 5 for id, 10, 11, 12). While neither conviction appears to constitute an aggravated felony by itself under the law in effect at the time of the Immigration Judge’s January 1999 decision, because neither was individually punishable as a felony under federal law, the respondent’s second conviction for possession of marijuana was punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act because of the prior conviction. See 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a); Matter of K-V-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1163 (BIA 1999); Matter of L-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 89 (BIA 1995). We further note that marijuana was then listed as a controlled substance under federal law. 21 U.S.C. § 812. Therefore, as the respondent had been convicted of what was then considered to be an aggravated felony, he would have been ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 Second, the respondent argues that his former attorney failed to advise him that his United States citizen wife could have filed an I-130 petition for alien relative on his behalf in 1999. We agree with the Immigration Judge that because the evidence submitted by the respondent shows that he was not married until April 14, 2002, more than 3 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and the respondent retained new counsel shortly after the entry of the 1999 removal order, this assertion does not show ineffective assistance by his former counsel.
 
Finally, the respondent argues that his prior attorney was remiss in not advising him to file an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under the former provisions of section 212(c) of the Act. However, pursuant to the law in effect in January 1999, section 212(c) relief was not available to persons in removal proceedings. See sections 304(a)(3) and 304(b) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“Section 212(c) ( 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)) is repealed”); INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). Thus, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the actions of his prior attorney, as is required in order to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
Nevertheless, we observe that the respondent may now be eligible to apply for a waiver under the former provisions of section 212(c) of the Act. The respondent was charged with removability for having committed a controlled substance violation, which is waivable under section 212(c) of the Act (Exh. 1). However, as noted above, it appears that the respondent’s multiple convictions for possession of marijuana constitute an aggravated felony, which does not correspond to a comparable ground of inadmissibility and is thus not a waivable offense. Nevertheless, our recent precedent Matter of Azurin, 23 I&N Dec. 695 (BIA 2005) may have application to this case. Therein, we held that an alien who was ineligible for a waiver under former section 212(c) because his aggravated felony charge did not correspond to a comparable ground of inadmissibility could seek a section 212(c) waiver in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act if the underlying conviction also would render the alien inadmissible. Matter of Azurin, supra, at 696. Furthermore, it appears the respondent now has family in the United States for purposes of meeting the adjustment of status prong which requires the immediate availability of an immigrant visa. See id; Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993). Accordingly, we will sustain the respondent’s appeal, and remand this matter to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s current eligibility for relief from removal.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

In a decision dated April 6, 2006, we denied the respondent’s February 16, 2006, emergency motion to reopen due to a lack of jurisdiction. However, we noted that we had granted the respondent’s request to stay removal proceedings on March 29, 2006, and that this stay order remained in effect, pending the outcome of our adjudication of the instant appeal.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION:. Termination
 
On January 30, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent has appealed from this decision. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(c).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Philippines. He entered the United States as an immigrant on September 13, 1986. On November 22, 1997, he was convicted of petty theft with a prior under Cal. Penal Code § 484. He later violated his probation and, on November 19, 2001, he was sentenced to 365 days in prison. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s offense made him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent has appealed from this decision.
 
On appeal, the respondent raises numerous arguments. He has challenged his removability, raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and argued that both the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) and the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process. The respondent’s arguments on these issues are without merit.
 
First, the respondent does qualify as an arriving alien subject to removal under section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a), despite his claims. When the respondent attempted to return to the United States at the Los Angeles International Airport on September 30, 2004, he was a returning resident, but he had committed an offense identified in section 212(a)(2) of the Act and had not been granted a waiver for that crime. He therefore fell within section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), and is considered an alien seeking admission.
 
The respondent maintains that his crime of petty theft does not make him removable or subject to removal under section 212(a)(2) of the Act, but we must disagree. The crime of petty theft is a crime involving moral turpitude, and the respondent’s offense does not fit within the petty offense exception because it is not the respondent’s only conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude. See sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i) and 212(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act (indicating that the crime involving moral turpitude provision does not apply to an alien who has committed only one crime). The record shows that the respondent has been convicted of petty theft on at least one other occasion. Accordingly, the respondent’s 1997 conviction for petty theft makes him removable as charged. We therefore uphold the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability.
 
*2 In addition, we see no evidence that the DHS or the Immigration Judge violated the respondent’s due process rights. The DHS had a proper basis for placing the respondent in proceedings and for detaining him upon his arrival.
 
Finally, the respondent has not provided any detail regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not explained why his former attorney’s performance was ineffective, and he has not attempted to meet the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We therefore cannot conclude that the respondent is entitled to a new hearing on the basis of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
On the other hand, we do find that a remand is necessary to allow the respondent to pursue cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for this form of relief because the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s conviction for petty theft was a conviction for an aggravated felony. The respondent’s offense, however, does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See United States v. Corona-Sanchez, 291 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
The offense of petty theft has a maximum possible sentence of 6 months, a sentence that is too short to make the offense an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. We may not look to the recidivist enhancement the respondent received in determining whether his crime meets the sentence requirement of section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. See United States v. Corona Sanchez, supra, at 1210-11.
 
Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony or that he is statutorily barred from obtaining cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. We therefore remand his case to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to pursue this form of relief.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arthur S. Raznick,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 27, 2006. In her motion, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Service (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion arguing that the respondent failed to meet the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
To satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support her claim by a detailed affidavit, inform her previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, if not, why not, and demonstrate that she suffered prejudice. Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997); Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, as the respondent did support her claim with a detailed affidavit, file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, or inform her former counsel of the allegations against him. We do not find that the instant case presents a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel in which the Lozada requirements need not be strictly applied. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The respondent’s motion to stay removal is also denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Resendez Guarjardo, Esquire
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 7, 2005, denying his motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had previously denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen to apply for special rule cancellation or a special immigrant petition. The appeal will be dismissed. See section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b).
 
The record reflects that in a decision dated March 17, 2005, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure to July 15, 2005. On July 28, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and reopen to pursue an application for special rule cancellation or a special immigrant petition. The respondent also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure of his former counsel to advise the respondent of his apparent eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2) of the Act as the battered spouse of a United States citizen.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reconsider. He acknowledges that since he is no longer married to a U.S. citizen spouse or a lawful permanent resident, he is now ineligible to file a visa petition pursuant to the self-petitioning process under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act. He asserts that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2) of the Act, as an abused spouse. However, section 240A(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(2)(A)(ii) states as follows:
“the alien has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 3 years immediately preceding the date of such application, and the issuance of a charging, document for removal proceedings shall not toll the 3-year period of continuous physical presence in the United States.”
 
The record reflects that the respondent was admitted to the United States on November 12, 2003, as a nonimmigrant visitor. See Exh. 1 (Notice to Appear); Form EOIR-42B (Application for Cancellation of Removal). Consequently, the respondent is unable to establish that he has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than three years immediately preceding the date of his application for cancellation of removal, and therefore, he is ineligible for cancellation of removal on this basis. The respondent has not indicated that he is eligible for any other relief. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination; motion to remand
 
This case was last before the Board on September 27, 2005, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings regarding the issue of the respondent’s removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an aggravated felon as defined by section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G). The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 9, 2005, decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal due to his conviction for an aggravated felony. During the pendency of the respondent’s appeal, he filed a motion to remand. The motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
The record reflects that on October 18, 2004, the respondent was convicted of receiving stolen property in violation of section 496(a) of the California Penal Code and was sentenced to 1 year and 4 months imprisonment (Exh. 2). On the basis of this conviction, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal in his original April 26, 2005, decision. Upon appeal to the Board, we remanded the record for further consideration of whether the respondent’s conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony given our determination that section 496(a) of the California Penal code is a divisible statute encompassing conduct that would be considered an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act and conduct that would not. We also directed the Immigration Judge and the parties to address the issue of whether the use of a probation report summary of a police report is allowed in the Ninth Circuit where the police report is directly relevant.
 
Upon remand, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) submitted the actual police report in reference to the respondent’s October 18, 2004, conviction, and in his September 27, 2005, decision, the Immigration Judge found that the police report was admissible as part of the conviction record because it was directly referenced in the plea colloquy when the respondent pled guilty (I.J. Dec. at 2). In consideration of the evidence, the Immigration Judge found that it was clear upon the record of conviction that the respondent acted as a principal in the theft offense in that he in fact stole the property that was the basis of the conviction (I.J. Dec. at 2). As a result, the Immigration Judge again found the respondent removable as an aggravated felon as defined in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act (I.J. Dec. at 2). In his appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in allowing the police report into evidence in proving that his conviction is one for an aggravated felony.
 
*2 While the respondent is quite right that a police incident report, standing alone, is not admissible to prove that an alien convicted under a divisible statute, such as section 496(a) of the California Penal Code, has in fact been convicted of a “theft offense” under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, see Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), that proscription is not applicable where, as here, the contents of such a report have been specifically incorporated by reference into the respondent’s guilty plea. See Parrilla v. Gonzales, 414 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir. 2005) (statement of facts in police certification of probable cause admissible to prove that alien’s Washington conviction for communication with a minor for an immoral purpose was “sexual abuse of a minor” under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act where guilty plea transcript reflected alien’s understanding that the trial court would rely on that certification to determine if there was a factual basis for the plea). Under these circumstances, the police report ceases to be extrinsic evidence, it becomes an integral part of the plea agreement itself, and is as admissible as any other evidence that would reflect the factual basis for the plea.
 
In this case, the transcript of the respondent’s plea colloquy clearly reflects that the factual basis for his plea, as it related to the stolen property, was derived from the police incident report. In turn, that police incident report clearly reflects that the property at issue was stolen by the respondent. Because the information contained in the police incident report was relied upon by the trial judge as constituting the factual basis of the respondent’s plea as it related to the stolen property, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly relied on that information to conclude that the respondent was convicted of a theft offense under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act.
 
However, through his motion to remand, the respondent has presented evidence that his October 18, 2004, conviction for receiving stolen property was vacated by the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda — Hayward Division, on or about January 3, 2006. According to the vacation document, the respondent’s conviction was vacated based upon “ineffective assistance of counsel at entry of plea in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.” Under these circumstances, we find it necessary to remand the record in order to determine the circumstances underlying the vacation of the respondent’s conviction and whether or not the conviction remains valid for immigration purposes. Compare Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (conviction vacated as a result of the failure to advise the alien of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes) with Matter of Marroquin, 23 I&N Dec. 705 (A.G. 2005) (the federal definition of “conviction” at section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, encompasses convictions, other than those involving first-time simple possession of narcotics, that have been vacated or set aside pursuant to an expungement statute for reasons that do not go to the legal propriety of the original judgment, and that continue to impose some restrains or penalties upon the alien’s liberty).
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Silver,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent has failed to file a brief on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(E). However, the statement on the respondent’s Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR 26), indicates that the respondent believes he received ineffective assistance of counsel. It is unclear as to whether this respondent, who appears before us pro se, is referring to his representation before the Immigration Judge, or during his criminal trial before the New Jersey Superior Court. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In the instant matter, the respondent has not satisfied any of the requirements we set forth in our decision, such as explaining what arrangement he had with counsel or why he feels that the representation he received was inadequate, or whether he suffered actual prejudice from the allegedly deficient representation. Matter of Lozada, supra. To the extent that the respondent contests an aspect of the validity of his criminal conviction such as the adequacy of his prior counsel in those proceedings, it is well established that this Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, nor can this Board go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the alien. Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas A. Mix, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on March 19, 2003. We denied previous motions on July 25, 2003, and February 5, 2004. The respondent filed another motion to reopen on November 25, 2005, that is both untimely and barred by numerical limitations for motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and has equities that should be considered that would warrant reopening of his claim to cancellation of removal. First, there is no reason to toll the time or numerical limitations for motions in this case. The respondent was represented by current counsel at the time we issued our February 5, 2004, decision, yet the pending motion was not filed for over a year and a half later. Moreover, the respondent raised his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel prior to our denial of his motion on February 5, 2004. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed our February 5, 2004, decision on March 13, 2006, Solis-Arenas v. Gonzales, 2006 WL 616064 (9th Cir. Mar. 13, 2006). In its unpublished decision, the Ninth circuit found that the respondent had not shown that an exception to the numerical limitations for motions applied. Moreover, the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Ninth Circuit found. The pending motion is subject to the same deficiencies as the Ninth Circuit found existed as to the respondent’s last motion.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aroon Roy Padharia, Esquire
 
ORDER
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s January 27, 2005, denial of a motion to continue. The Immigration Judge found that because the respondent’s first Form I-140 had been denied, that it was not reasonable to continue the proceedings to allow the respondent to pursue a second Form I-140 through the same employer (I.J. at 2). The record is remanded for further proceedings. We are unable to determine whether the respondent established good cause for a continuance because of the numerous “indiscernibles” (Tr. at 1-4) and the absence of Exhibit 3, referenced.by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent maintains that due to ineffecfive assistance of former counsel, his first Form I-140 was denied, necessitating that the respondent file a new Form I-140. We find remand warranted to allow insertion of the referenced exhibit, to clarify the indiscernibles in the current record, and for further discussion regarding the circumstances of the denial of the first Form I-140. We remind the respondent of the requirements of setting forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA); aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
On appeal, the respondent also argues that he is eligible for voluntary departure. In this regard, we note that the Immigration Judge only offered the respondent either pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) or an appeal, but did not consider voluntary departure at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240B(b) of the Act 8 (Tr. at 4). While it would appear that the proceedings were at the Master Calendar stage, which would normally involve a grant of voluntary departure requiring a waiver of appeal, it is also true that the respondent had pursued the only form of relief available to him and was denied a continuance to further pursue it. Therefore, the Immigration Judge may consider voluntary departure at the conclusion of proceedings. Accordingly, we find remand appropriate for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew W. Rau, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on December 13, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion to remand to apply for adjustment of status, and dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a continuance as well as the Immigration Judge’s order removing the respondent to Pakistan. The respondent now moves to reopen these removal proceedings based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the pending motion to reopen. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). As we find the respondent’s former counsel’s assistance ineffective and resulting prejudice to the respondent’s case, the unopposed motion to reopen will be granted, these removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with the following opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
Initially, we note that the respondent’s motion to reopen was timely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (90-day deadline). Moreover, we find that the respondent has complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which have been set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Current counsel for the respondent asserts that the respondent’s former counsel erroneously advised the respondent that he should not accept a voluntary departure from the Immigration Judge because he would be eligible for adjustment of status in the United States upon the approval of the Form I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker filed on his behalf. We have no indication that former counsel has responded to current counsel’s accusatory letter, the respondent’s affidavit, and the bar complaint. Furthermore, former counsel previously moved this Board for a remand, subsequent to the I-140 Approval, arguing the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status where the respondent was ineligible to adjust his status to permanent residence in this country. See Decision of the Board, dated December 13, 2005; Respondent’s Motion to Remand, dated June 18, 2004. Under these circumstances, we must find ineffective assistance of former counsel that prejudiced the respondent’s case. Based on the evidence before us, we conclude that former counsel’s inadequate performance prevented the respondent from receiving a voluntary departure order, which the Immigration Judge declared he was willing to grant (Tr. at 5-7, 14-16). If the respondent had accepted and complied with a voluntary departure order, he would have been eligible for consular processing of an immigrant visa absent the need for a waiver of a final removal order.
 
*2 As the respondent has established that he suffered ineffective assistance by former counsel and resulting prejudice, the appeal will be sustained, these removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for an adjudication of the respondent’s application for the minimal relief of voluntary departure.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, these removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Madeline Garcia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stuart A. Siegel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 3, 2006, when we granted the respondent’s request for a stay of his removal proceeding, pending our consideration of his motion to reconsider. On February 21, 2006, the respondent filed a Motion to Reconsider our January 19, 2006, order, claiming the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, as well as an Emergency Motion for Stay of Removal. On March 6, 2006, the Department of Homeland security (DHS) filed an opposition to the motion to reconsider1. On January 19, 2006, we had dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for adjustment of status. We also denied the respondent’s motion to remand based on a new affidavit of support, submitted during the pendency of the appeal, as we found that the respondent had not provided an explanation for why the Affidavit of Support he attempted to submit was previously unavailable and could not have been discovered at the prior hearing.
 
We note that we did not receive the respondent’s appellate brief dated July 3, 2005, or any of the attachments to his brief, by the time we decided his appeal, and these documents were therefore not considered. The attachments consist of statements under the penalty of perjury dated July 2005, from the respondent, his wife, and his mother-in- law, as well as a Complaint to the Florida Bar, dated June 29, 2005, complaining about the actions of the respondent’s former attorney in this case2.
 
The DHS notes in its opposition that the argument about the Affidavit of Support is essentially the same argument the respondent made in his appeal brief, challenging the denial of his adjustment application. On April 3, 2006, we granted the respondent’s request for a stay of removal pending our consideration of his motion to reconsider. The motion to reconsider will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
In his motion to reconsider, the respondent argues that his former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, by failing to file a proper Affidavit of Support (I-864) with a qualifying sponsor. We note that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion to reconsider must show prejudice. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005). Prejudice exists of the kind sufficient to support such a claim in immigration proceedings when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is reasonable probability that, but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Id at 1274. In this case, the respondent alleges that his former counsel’s failure to file an appropriate affidavit of support constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. We find this argument to have merit, as the denial of adjustment relief was based, in large part, on his former counsel’s misunderstanding of what needed to be submitted for the Affidavit of Support, and this resulted in prejudice to the respondent. We note that on appeal, the respondent offered a new Affidavit of Support. In addition, one of the attachments to his brief is a complaint filed with the Florida bar by the respondent against his former attorney, and the former attorney was notified of this complaint. As such, it appears that the respondent has facially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 The respondent’s adjustment application was also denied as a matter of discretion because of what the Immigration Judge found to be misrepresentations on the application and in the testimony (I.J. at 16). We note that the DHS approved the I-130 filed by the respondent’s wife. The respondent and his wife now submitted statements to address the discrepancies, and to offer plausible explanations for the inconsistencies identified by the Immigration Judge.
 
Under these circumstances, we will grant the motion, and remand to the Immigration Judge to reconsider the respondent’s adjustment claim. On remand, the Immigration Judge should consider the new filings, including the Affidavit of Support and the Florida bar complaint. He should also reassess the bona fides of the marriage, and take into account the explanations submitted by the respondent and his wife, in which they account for discrepancies in the record regarding residence locations and employment.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan R. Diamante, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On December 14, 2005, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, filed the instant motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The respondent’s motion is time and number barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened). The Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal on June 18, 1999, and denied his first motion to reopen on January 10, 2001.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent raises an ineffective assistance claim against, Ms. Laura Friend, a non-attorney who held herself out to be an attorney. The respondent claims that in 1997, Ms. Friend advised him to place himself in removal proceedings at a time when he was ineligible for relief from removal. As a result of Ms. Friend’s bad advice, he is now the subject of a final order of removal, and, consequently, he is ineligible to file his adjustment application with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B at 3-7.
 
We recognize that, in the Ninth Circuit where this case arises, aliens raising an ineffective assistance claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. Additionally, aliens like the respondent can assert an ineffective assistance claim against a non-attorney. See generally Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002). To prevail on ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the alien must demonstrate inter alia that his case was substantially prejudiced by counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. Such prejudice means that alien must show that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
On review of the respondent’s motion and supporting documentation, we cannot find that his case was substantially prejudiced by Ms. Friend’s alleged misconduct. The allegations made against Ms. Friend are similar to those alleged by the respondents in Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra. Namely, the aliens were advised to place themselves in deportation proceedings so that they could apply for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Ultimately, they were placed in removal proceedings and precluded from applying for suspension of deportation. The Ninth Circuit held in Lara-Torres that “¿Rºemoval proceedings do not become constitutionally unfair simply because they are precipitated in part by an attorney’s advice…or because the illegal alien might believe that he could avoid detection until eligible for another form of relief.” Id. at 974. Additionally, the respondent in this case does not allege ineffective assistance against the attorneys who represented him before the Board and the Immigration Judge. The respondent does not allege deficiencies that pertain to his actual removal hearing.
 
*2 The respondent also asserts that Ms. Friend is to blame for his inability to apply for adjustment of status before the DHS. However, the respondent’s immigrant visa did not become available until June 17, 2002, well after his proceedings before the Immigration Judge and this Board were complete. See Motion to Reopen, Tab E.
 
Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to successfully present an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that warrants equitable tolling of the filing deadlines for motions to reopen. In sum, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as it exceeds the time and number bars.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on September 29, 2004, when we summarily affirmed an Immigration Judge’s May 13, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s application for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On December 19, 2005, the respondent submitted a motion to reissue the Board’s decision which was rejected because the motion was not accompanied by the required filing fee or fee waiver form. The respondent perfected his motion and filed it on January 24, 2006. Through his motion, the respondent claims that his former attorney, Alex Solomiany, Esquire, provided him ineffective assistance by failing to inform him of the Board’s decision until December 8, 2005, and by failing to timely file a petition for review of the Board’s decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The respondent also filed a motion for a stay of removal on January 17, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition to the motion. The motions are denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue the Board’s decision is untimely filed because it was not filed within 90 days of our September 29, 2004, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent points to no exceptions to the time restrictions on motions to reopen which might be applicable to the instant motion. Moreover, we decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte and reissue our decision based upon the respondent’s claim that he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney. The respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Because the respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements, his motion to reopen and reissue the Board’s prior decision, based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, is denied. See Dakane v. United States Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. United States Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003). The motion to reissue is therefore denied and the respondent’s motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen and reissue is denied and the motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN RE: DIANA LORENA RODRIGUEZ
File: AXX XX9 442 - Houston

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
  
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas Wachholz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 6, 2005. She filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge arguing that her counsel instructed her not to appear for her hearing because a motion to change venue was submitted with the Immigration Court. On December 6, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. The Immigration Judge noted the record did not contain a motion to change venue. The Immigration Judge further ruled the respondent had an obligation to appear for her hearing because she did not receive notification that the Immigration Judge granted her motion. The respondent appealed that ruling to the Board.
 
We have reviewed the record, and note, as did the Immigration Judge, that the respondent’s motion to change venue is not contained therein prior to September 6, 2005. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is obligated to appear for her scheduled hearing until the request to change venue is granted. The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his or her responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). Counsel’s assumption that the motion will be granted is not a valid reason to excuse the respondent from her failure to appear. This aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
The respondent further argues in her brief that these proceedings should be reopened because she relied on her attorney’s instruction that it was unnecessary to appear for the hearing. Counsel for the respondent submitted an affidavit that states that he told the respondent that her motion to change venue to Arlington, Virginia, will likely be granted, and she need not appear. The respondent argues that she should not be penalized because she relied on the advice of her attorney.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
*2 It is also required that the claimant establish that she suffered prejudice as a result of her attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). We further note the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes as valid the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir. 2000).
 
The respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that she was the victim of attorney negligence. The respondent has not filed an affidavit in support of her motion. She also did not file a complaint against her counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authority, or explain why she did not do so. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings based on the respondent having been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura L. Lichter, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald C. O’Hare
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on February 9, 2006, when we summarily affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 29, 2004. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen wherein he requests, inter alia, a remand in order to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 C.F.R. § 1255, based on an unadjudicated immediate relative visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has indicated that it is opposed to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
We determined in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), that a properly filed motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion, where: (1) the motion to reopen is timely filed; (2) the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations; (3) the motion is not barred by Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), or on any other procedural grounds;(4) clear and convincing evidence is presented indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide; and (5) the DHS does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992). However, the respondent may not benefit from our decision in Matter of Velarde, supra, in view of the DHS’ opposition to the respondent’s motion, on discretionary grounds, not based on Matter of Arthur, supra. Therefore, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that reopening of the proceedings is warranted on that basis.
 
Moreover, in the current motion, the respondent attempts to present arguments that should have been made in the context of his original appeal. A motion to reopen is not a substitute for an appeal. It is not to be used as an opportunity for a second effort at proving factual allegations or presenting alternate legal arguments. See Matter of Guevara, 20 I&N Dec. 238 (BIA 1991); see also Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The Board’s decision as to such issues is final. To hold otherwise would invite repeated piecemeal reopening and would render immigration litigation virtually interminable, contrary to the strong public interest in finality of immigration litigation once the parties have had an opportunity to develop their cases. INS v. Abudu, supra at 107-108 (1988); Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
*2 Notwithstanding, we find respondent’s contentions that he was denied constitutional due process by the Immigration Judge, in that he failed to advise the respondent of the availability of relief from removal and to afford him the opportunity to apply for either cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, or voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, or any other relief under the Act, belied by the record. Specifically, the record reflects that when the respondent’s counsel was asked by the Immigration Judge, if he was seeking any relief from removal, other than termination of the proceedings, he replied, “¿nºo, your Honor” (Tr. at 46). The respondent is bound by the actions of his former counsel. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (absent a showing of egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney is binding on the alien).
 
The record reflects the respondent’s counsel knowingly and willingly elected not pursue any relief from removal (Tr. at 46), opting instead to focus on contesting the charges of removability as applied to the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, supra. Moreover, although the respondent does not directly challenge his attorney’s performance in this regard,1 we note that it is not considered ineffective assistance for counsel to make tactical decisions that ultimately fizzle and redound to the client’s detriment. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685, 694 (1st Cir. 1983), citing Magallanez-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986); Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, 640 F.2d 1139, 1142 (9th Cir. 1981); Awad v. Ashcroft, 328 F.3d 336, 343 (7th Cir. 2003) (hindsight applied to unwise tactical decision, to withdrawal of application for asylum, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a female, and a citizen of the People’s Republic of China. On December 10, 1999, the respondent was ordered removed from the United States because she did not appear for her hearing. The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge on November 3, 2005. Therein, the respondent indicates that her prior attorney failed to inform her of the correct time of the hearing. She further indicates that she is now the mother of two United States citizen children, and fears persecution in China on account of her alleged violation of the population control law. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on November 14, 2005, and this appeal followed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not show that her failure to appear for her hearing was caused by “exceptional circumstances.” The respondent’s motion to reopen was also filed untimely with the Immigration Judge. In Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000), the court recognized the doctrine of “equitable tolling” of the statute of limitations regarding the filing of a motion to reopen. The court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. Id. In that case, the court concluded that the alien failed to demonstrate such diligence, and concluded that equitable tolling did not apply. Id.
 
Accordingly, under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of her former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for proving that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm this aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision. We further note the respondent has not shown that she pursued reopening with due diligence as she has not explained why she waited approximately 6 years to seek reopening. We therefore, agree with the Immigration Judge that it is inappropriate to reopen these proceedings based on the respondent having shown that she was the victim of attorney negligence.
 
The respondent further argues in her motion to reopen and on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened because of the birth of her two United States citizen children, and her fear of persecution in China on account thereof. There is no time limit on the filing of motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under section under section 208 or 241(b)(3) and is based upon changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(c)(7)(C)(ii). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i) and Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999) (holding that aliens seeking to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of deportation or removal who have presented evidence establishing materially changed circumstances in their homeland or place of last habitual residence, such that they meet the general requirements for motions to reopen, need not demonstrate “reasonable cause” for their failure to appear at the prior hearing).
 
The Immigration Judge neglected to address this issue in his decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. However, in Guan v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 2003), the Second Circuit concluded that changed circumstances arising in the United States are not within the exception found above. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent fears the “continued” implementation of Chinese population control policies rather than a material change in those policies. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings. See also Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec, 899 (BIA 2006).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We further note the respondent has not shown that she pursued reopening with due diligence as she has not explained why she waited approximately 6 years to seek reopening. We therefore, agree with the Immigration Judge that it is inappropriate to reopen these proceedings based on the respondent having shown that she was the victim of attorney negligence.
 
The respondent further argues in her motion to reopen and on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened because of the birth of her two United States citizen children, and her fear of persecution in China on account thereof. There is no time limit on the filing of motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under section under section 208 or 241(b)(3) and is based upon changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(c)(7)(C)(ii). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i) and Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999) (holding that aliens seeking to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of deportation or removal who have presented evidence establishing materially changed circumstances in their homeland or place of last habitual residence, such that they meet the general requirements for motions to reopen, need not demonstrate “reasonable cause” for their failure to appear at the prior hearing).
 
The Immigration Judge neglected to address this issue in his decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. However, in Guan v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 2003), the Second Circuit concluded that changed circumstances arising in the United States are not within the exception found above. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent fears the “continued” implementation of Chinese population control policies rather than a material change in those policies. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings. See also Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec, 899 (BIA 2006).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luis Carlos Ayala, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Janet L. Murray
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 18, 2005, decision, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged in the Notice to Appear. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and her motion to remand will be denied.
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge with the following additions. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole for in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent presents multiple arguments on appeal, which will be addressed in turn. Foremost, is the respondent’s argument that she received ineffective assistance from her former counsel. The respondent claims, on appeal, that she did not get competent representation and that her former counsel failed to appear at her April 18, 2005, hearing. The respondent also avers that her former counsel failed to file a motion regarding a request for a change of venue and outlining forms of relief available to the respondent. The respondent admits that the Immigration Judge provided her with a complaint form relating to ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge instructed the respondent that she (the respondent) knew best what happened between her and her counsel and that, if she believed that such counsel did not represent her adequately, then she could file a complaint. See Tr. at 28. However, there is no indication that a complaint has ever been filed.
 
In order to show that her former counsel was ineffective, the respondent must normally meet the three requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Ninth Circuit has generally found that the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra, are reasonable, “and under ordinary circumstances the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000). Here, the respondent failed to set forth in an affidavit the agreement that she had with her former counsel regarding such counsel’s representation. She failed to provide evidence that her former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed to respond. In addition, she failed to indicate that a complaint was lodged with the bar, or provide reasons explaining why she did not lodge such a complaint. As the respondent failed to satisfy the Matter of Lozada, supra criteria, we find that she has not adequately established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 The respondent additionally avers that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying her request for a continuance to obtain different counsel. However, we note that the respondent testified that she was aware that her former counsel did not want go to court in San Diego, due to the commute. At the respondent’s initial hearing (December 20, 2004), the respondent’s former counsel indicated that the respondent could obtain new counsel if the case was going to be heard in San Diego. See Tr. at 12. It is unclear exactly what was communicated, to the respondent, by her former counsel, as the respondent has not submitted an affidavit concerning her agreement with her former counsel. The respondent indicated that she had already thought about getting different counsel in San Diego, and she had talked to another attorney prior to her hearing about taking her case. It is unclear why the respondent would have been talking to another counsel about taking her case if she truly thought that her former counsel would be continuing to represent her, as she suggested at her hearing. Considering the facts in this particular case, we find that it is reasonable and acceptable for the Immigration Judge to have denied the request for an additional continuance, while providing instructions concerning the filing of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which we note the respondent failed to follow. On the other hand, we note that there is no medical evidence provided concerning the respondent’s former counsel’s alleged appointment on the day of the hearing. See Tr. at 18. In addition, the Immigration Judge pointed out that he did not find good cause to again continue the respondent’s hearing, for her to obtain new counsel, when there was no indication that there was any relief from removal available to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6; see also Biwot v. Gonzales, 403. F.3d 1094, 1100 (noting that, if the petitioner does not affirmatively waive his or her right to counsel, the Immigration Judge must inquire whether there is good cause to grant petitioner more time to obtain counsel). The respondent does not indicate on appeal that any relief is currently available to her. There is no evidence that the out come of the respondent’s case would change if the record were remanded. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992). Thus, there is insufficient evidence that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion, that due process was denied, or that a remand is warranted in the instant case, based on the denial of a continuance.
 
The respondent also avers that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying the respondent’s request for a change of venue. However, similar to the basis for his denial of a continuance, the Immigration Judge found that there was no good cause to grant such request as there was no relief available to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.20. The respondent indicates on appeal that there was good cause to change venue, as she needed to present witnesses who lived in Los Angeles. However, there is no indication that the respondent has any relief available to her concerning which there would be a need to present witnesses. The respondent does not indicate that she is eligible for any relief from removal, nor is there any application for relief presented by the respondent. Hence, we can not find that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying such request or motion for a change of venue.
 
*3 The respondent argues that she should be able to withdraw her former admissions, with respect to the allegations and charge of removal delineated in the Notice to Appear, due to the ineffective assistance provided by her former counsel. However, as noted above, the respondent has failed to adequately establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, we have determined that, absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). Consequently, in the instant case, as no egregious circumstances have been sufficiently established, the admission with regard to the allegations and charge is binding on the respondent in the instant case and maybe relied upon as evidence of removability.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and her motion to remand is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eduardo A. Paredes, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine Halliday-Roberts,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The Immigration Judge neglected to prepare a separate oral or written decision in this matter addressing the issues raised in the respondent’s motion to reopen, and, therefore, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a full decision. See Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). The Immigration Judge’s form order dated November 21, 2005, states that the “respondent has predicated his motion on an assertion of a prior attorney’s ineffective assistance - but has failed to file a bar claim or otherwise conform to Lozada.”
 
The Immigration Judge failed to address the issue of notice raised in the respondent’s motion. Specifically, the respondent contends that he failed to appear at his hearing because he did not receive notice of the hearing from the Immigration Court. Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen, the respondent never raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge failed to determine whether the respondent received proper service of the Order to Show Cause and the notice of hearing in accordance with section 242B of the Act and applicable case law. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Huete, 20 I&N Dec. 250 (BIA 1991). We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision provides an insufficient basis upon which the Board can adequately conduct a meaningful review. Upon preparation of the full decision, the Immigration Judge shall issue an order administratively returning the record to the Board. The Immigration Judge shall serve the administrative return order on the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security. The Board will thereafter give the parties an opportunity to submit briefs in accordance with the regulations.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court for further action as required above.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lola Oni, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anne E. Gannon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal will be dismissed, as the respondent waived the right to appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) argues that the appeal should be dismissed summarily.
 
The respondent’s final removal hearing took place on January 18, 2006, and the respondent was represented by attorney Courtney Smith (Tr. at 318-23). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was undeserving of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), after weighing the positive factors against the respondent’s criminal record. Counsel reserved the right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision (Tr. at 321). On January 24, 2006, Smith wrote a letter to the Immigration Judge stating that the respondent “has authorized me to withdraw his reservation of appeal of your decision on January 18, 2006”. Counsel further stated that the respondent “understands his right to appeal but wants the order of the court to become final immediately.” As a result, on February 1, 2006, the Immigration Judge issued an amended order in which he noted that the respondent had waived appeal. The respondent nevertheless submitted a Notice of Appeal on February 17, 2006, that was rejected for a filing defect, and filed on February 24, 2006.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
Counsel submitted a letter in which she claims that the respondent did not authorize attorney Smith to submit the letter withdrawing the right to appeal. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board).
 
Despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). These cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zheng v. U. S. Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2005). Most particularly, there is no affidavit from the respondent setting out the claims against former counsel, and former counsel has not been allowed to respond to the charges made in current counsel’s statement.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen. This is the respondent’s third time before the Board. This case was last before us on August 2, 2004, when we affirmed without opinion the Immigration Judge’s decision denying voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. This motion to reopen is untimely by over a year, and we do not find that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel or that this case warrants reopening sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
First, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements for a motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Also, contrary to the respondent’s argument, the conviction record submitted to the Immigration Judge does indicate that the respondent was convicted for delivering cocaine (Warrant of Commitment).¿FN1º Therefore, we find no ineffective assistance that is plain on the record.
 
Although the respondent has entitled his motion a motion to reopen, the respondent’s second argument, that the Board erred in its first decision, dated March 7, 2003, by stating that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony, is more properly considered a motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Nevertheless, the motion remains untimely and we find no error in that decision. Although the respondent’s controlled substance conviction does not render him removable as an aggravated felon because there is insufficient evidence that he was convicted after admission, his offense remains an aggravated felony as that term is defined under the Act. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely. The request for a stay pending consideration of the motion is denied as moot.

We note that the respondent’s conviction record has not been identified with an exhibit number. As the respondent has not challenged the admission of his conviction record and it specifies that the controlled substance involved was cocaine, we find the absence of an exhibit number to be harmless error. Also, we find it unnecessary to address the conviction documents submitted by the DHS on appeal.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 21, 2004, which denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), for lack of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. Additionally, the respondent moves for remand, alleging that her ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced her claim for relief. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
First, we find that the respondent has complied with the requirements relating to motions based on ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She submitted an affidavit detailing her agreement with her former law firm (Respondent’s Exh. 1). She also filed a complaint form with the State Bar of California against the attorney who represented her at the merits hearing, Heinrich Davis, and notified him of her complaint in writing (Respondent’s Exh. 4).
 
In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceeding, a respondent must demonstrate that the attorney failed to perform with sufficient competence. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent is also required to show that her case was prejudiced by her counsel’s performance. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent states in her affidavit that she had no contact with any attorney from the law firm representing her until 30 minutes before her hearing on November 8, 2004. A secretary from the firm called her a week in advance and told her to arrive at the office one hour before the hearing; at that time, the secretary briefly interviewed the respondent prior to the attorney’s arrival. At this point, the respondent still did not know what sort of relief she was seeking. Her case was continued until December 21, 2004. The respondent states that at that point she still was unprepared to testify about potential hardship to her lawful permanent resident mother and three United States citizen daughters - ages 15, 14, and 3. She alleges that her former attorney’s failure to elicit information and documentary evidence from her about her daughters and her 72-year-old mother, who currently lives with her, negatively affected the outcome of her case. The respondent also suggests that the Immigration Judge made assumptions about her husband’s willingness to support her and her daughters financially that would not have been made if her former attorney had obtained basic information from her prior to the hearing.
 
*2 We find that the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the respondent’s former attorney failed to perform with sufficient competence. In addition to the issues raised in the affidavit, the transcript reflects that the attorney failed to correct an error on the respondent’s cancellation application prior to her hearing, that he submitted 140 pages of evidence on the date of the November 2004 hearing in violation of the Immigration Court’s filing rules, and that he relied on documents obtained by the respondent’s first representative in these proceedings, who was charged with immigration fraud in 2003 (Tr. at 12-14, 26-27; Respondent’s Exhs. 2, 3). We also note that the Immigration Judge described the testimony regarding the hardship issue as “scant” (Tr. at 64). We therefore conclude that the attorney’s poor performance may indeed have affected the outcome of the respondent’s proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

She submitted an affidavit detailing her agreement with her former law firm (Respondent’s Exh. 1). She also filed a complaint form with the State Bar of California against the attorney who represented her at the merits hearing, Heinrich Davis, and notified him of her complaint in writing (Respondent’s Exh. 4).
 
In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceeding, a respondent must demonstrate that the attorney failed to perform with sufficient competence. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent is also required to show that her case was prejudiced by her counsel’s performance. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent states in her affidavit that she had no contact with any attorney from the law firm representing her until 30 minutes before her hearing on November 8, 2004. A secretary from the firm called her a week in advance and told her to arrive at the office one hour before the hearing; at that time, the secretary briefly interviewed the respondent prior to the attorney’s arrival. At this point, the respondent still did not know what sort of relief she was seeking. Her case was continued until December 21, 2004. The respondent states that at that point she still was unprepared to testify about potential hardship to her lawful permanent resident mother and three United States citizen daughters — ages 15, 14, and 3. She alleges that her former attorney’s failure to elicit information and documentary evidence from her about her daughters and her 72-year-old mother, who currently lives with her, negatively affected the outcome of her case. The respondent also suggests that the Immigration Judge made assumptions about her husband’s willingness to support her and her daughters financially that would not have been made if her former attorney had obtained basic information from her prior to the hearing.
 
*2 We find that the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the respondent’s former attorney failed to perform with sufficient competence. In addition to the issues raised in the affidavit, the transcript reflects that the attorney failed to correct an error on the respondent’s cancellation application prior to her hearing, that he submitted 140 pages of evidence on the date of the November 2004 hearing in violation of the Immigration Court’s filing rules, and that he relied on documents obtained by the respondent’s first representative in these proceedings, who was charged with immigration fraud in 2003 (Tr. at 12-14, 26-27; Respondent’s Exhs. 2, 3). We also note that the Immigration Judge described the testimony regarding the hardship issue as “scant” (Tr. at 64). We therefore conclude that the attorney’s poor performance may indeed have affected the outcome of the respondent’s proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ORDER
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reconsider our prior decisions. This case has been the subject of a prior decision of the Board. On September 22, 2005, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The evidence submitted with the current motion shows that the respondent’s conviction was vacated on March 20, 2006, after the respondent was permitted to withdraw his guilty plea due to ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer was on notice of a mental defect and failed to investigate a possible insanity defense. This criminal conviction is the basis of the finding of removability. In the instant case, the court did not vacate the convictions for reasons solely related to immigration hardship. Instead, the court found the respondent’s guilty plea was not entered voluntarily, an error that rendered the conviction flawed.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ORDER
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen for purposes of pursuing an application for adjustment of status. The visa petition underlying the application is based on a marriage that was entered into during these proceedings, and it has not yet been approved. In Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), we held that, in limited circumstances, reopening will be permitted to pursue adjustment of status based on a marriage during proceedings. This case does not satisfy the Velarde requirements. We first note that the Department of Homeland Security’s opposition to the motion for reasons other than Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996) provides an independent basis for denying the motion. Matter of Velarde, supra. The DHS opposition raised the concern that the respondent has been inconsistent in his representations as to whether he had any prior marriages.
 
Further, we find that the evidence submitted as evidence of the bona fides of the marriage is not sufficient to meet the stringent clear and convincing standard. Id. The photos of the couple, wedding cards, and letters from cards are not objective evidence of their commingling of their assets and liabilities. The only evidence of an intended joint liability is an application for local phone service. We find that reopening is not warranted under Matter of Velarde, supra.
 
The respondent requests leave to supplement the motion he filed with the Immigration Judge with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the event we made such a finding. However, we do not interpret the statutory and regulatory numerical limits on motions as generally allowing for the filing of multiple or supplemental motions arguing alternate theories. See section 240(c)(6)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The respondent has not made a proper ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Further, such a claim will now be entertained only if the respondent is able to demonstrate a basis for equitably tolling the time and number restrictions on motions. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-133 (2d Cir. 2000)(aliens relying on equitable tolling must establish that their constitutional right to due process was violated by counsel’s conduct and that they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled).
 
*2 The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: FOWAD NASRULLAH CHAUDHRY
File: AXX XX9 893 - Elizabeth
April 19, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James Irani, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen. The motion is both time and number barred, and we find that no exception to the statutory and regulatory restrictions on motions applies. See section 240(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 1229a(c); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
On March 1, 2004, the Board affirmed, without opinion, an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion seeking reopening and the rescission of an in absentia removal order that was entered on June 25, 2003. Therefore, the June 25, 2003, order remains the final administrative order in the case. The instant motion makes an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, it fails to comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and thus has not established a basis for tolling the statutory and regulatory deadlines for motions. See Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132-34 (3d Cir. 2001); Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248 (3rd Cir. 2005). Specifically, the respondent did not notify his prior counsel of the charges against him and provide him an opportunity to respond.
 
In any event, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance, since he was not represented by counsel until after his in absentia order was entered. He is not seeking to apply for previously unavailable relief, but rather appears to be asserting that he was eligible for cancellation of removal at the time he appeared at an earlier hearing and should have been so advised by the Immigration Judge at that point, and later by the counsel who assisted him on the motion to reopen. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (the rescission standards need not be met in certain circumstances where the alien seeks to apply for relief that was not available at the time of the hearing).
 
He abandoned his opportunity to apply for discretionary relief when he failed to appear for his hearing. To the extent that he is now arguing that, had he known of the possibility of relief in the form of cancellation of removal, he would have shown up for his hearing, that is not an exceptional circumstance which would excuse his failure to appear as ordered even if a second motion to reopen were permitted. Such an argument is also inconsistent with his earlier claim that he did not appear because of his confusion over the scheduled date. Further, if his argument is that the counsel who represented him on the motion after the in absentia order was entered should have informed him of his eligibility for cancellation, he has not shown prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent is statutori!y ineligible for cancellation of removal because he failed to appeal for his hearing after proper notice was provided, and because he was unsuccessful in demonstrating exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7).
 
*2 The motion is denied.

IN RE: MARCO ANTONIO LOPEZ LARA
File: AXX XX1 855 - Los Angeles

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Bueno, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated November 16, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia on September 16, 2005. This appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The respondent is a citizen of Mexico, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The Immigration Judge notified the respondent that he would adjudicate the respondent’s section 212(c) application on September 16, 2005, at 1:00 p.m. in courtroom “F” located on the 14th floor of the Immigration Court. The respondent does not dispute that such notice was provided. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal in absentia because the respondent did not appear for the hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on October 5, 2005. Therein, the respondent indicates in his affidavit that his attorney advised him to appear for his hearing on September 16, 2005, in courtroom “U” on the 17th floor of the Immigration Court. He further indicates that his lawyer informed him that day to leave the Immigration Court building because the Immigration Judge was unavailable, and the case will be rescheduled. The respondent has provided an affidavit from his counsel’s secretary, and other proof of the erroneous instruction given to him by or on behalf of his attorney. The Immigration Judge found the notice of hearing proper, and the respondent had not shown “exceptional circumstance” to excuse his absence. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, and the respondent appealed that ruling to the Board.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but has not filed a bar complaint against counsel. In Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, require, among other things, that the alien file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See also Ray v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2006). In Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir. 2000), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial. In addition, the Ninth Circuit has held that statements made in a motion to reopen must be accepted as true unless inherently incredible. See Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 847 (9th Cir. 2004); Maroufi v. INS, 772 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1985). We further recognize the Ninth Circuit has held that a bar complaint may not be required where an alien offers a reasonable excuse for the omission and there is no suggestion of collusion between counsel and the alien. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
*2 In the instant case, the information provided in the respondent’s affidavit is believable and corroborated. We further cannot identify an indication that the respondent and counsel colluded to mislead the Immigration Judge and the Board. We therefore will not find the respondent’s failure to submit a complaint against counsel fatal to his request for reopening. We further find the respondent was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and will reopen these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 4, 2005, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on February 16, 1989. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal and in her motion, the respondent contends that she failed to appear for her hearing on February 16, 1989, due to ineffective assistance of counsel. She states that her former attorney of record, Oscar R. Perez, advised the respondent not to appear for her hearing as she would be immediately deported at the hearing. The respondent indicates that she filed for NACARA relief, although the respondent has not submitted any evidence that she filed for such relief. The respondent seeks reopening to demonstrate that she is eligible for relief under NACARA. In her motion to reopen, the respondent argued that equitable tolling should apply in her case, and that ineffective assistance of counsel is clear on the face of the administrative record since Mr. Perez failed to file an appeal on the respondent’s behalf after she was ordered deported in absentia.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, supra.
 
Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provides that while the requirements of Lozada are generally reasonable, they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 n.6 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth Circuit determined that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. Furthermore, where the face of the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, there has been substantial compliance with the rule. Id.
 
*2 The respondent failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent filed a motion to reopen pro se, in which she indicates that Mr. Perez advised her not to appear for her hearing on February 16, 1989. However, there is no evidence that her former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and given an opportunity to respond. The respondent also failed to submit a complaint to the State Bar of California regarding Mr. Perez. We note that there is no EOIR-28 form in the record of proceedings to indicate that Mr. Perez was representing the respondent before the Immigration Court. This is not a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel that may excuse strict compliance with the Lozada requirements. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (court found that alien had not substantially satisfied Lozada when he failed to submit an affidavit and could not prove that he gave former attorney notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond). Furthermore, while equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176; Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and she has failed to demonstrate reasonable cause for her failure to appear. Finally, despite the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of deportation dated February 16, 1989, the respondent waited almost 17 years before seeking to reopen her deportation proceedings.
 
The respondent also claims that she is eligible for relief pursuant to section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.43(c), an initial motion to reopen was due on September 11, 1998, and an application for suspension of deportation (Form I-881) had to be submitted by November 18, 1999. See 64 Fed. Reg. 40389-90 (July 26, 1999). The Immigration Judge and the Board are without authority to extend the time limits for filing a motion to reopen and a suspension application pursuant to section 203 of NACARA. The respondent has not submitted any evidence that she timely filed a motion to reopen pursuant to NACARA. On appeal the respondent indicates that she filed an application for relief under NACARA, but she does not state when it was filed, nor has she submitted a copy of her application. Therefore, the respondent failed to demonstrate that she timely filed an application for relief under NACARA by November 18, 1999. Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged that equitable tolling should be applied regarding her application for relief under NACARA. We note that precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that section 203(c) is a statute of limitations and is subject to equitable tolling. See Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.) (alien’s motion to reopen was deemed timely filed after establishing that equitable tolling applied due to ineffective assistance of counsel and alien had acted with due diligence in pursuing matter); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cr. 2003)(recognizing equitable tolling on motion to reopen during periods when alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien “acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002)(finding due diligence since new counsel promptly retained and motion to reopen filed after aliens learned conclusively that they had been misled by a non-attorney). We do not find that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 n.6 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth Circuit determined that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. Furthermore, where the face of the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, there has been substantial compliance with the rule. Id.
 
*2 The respondent failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent filed a motion to reopen pro se, in which she indicates that Mr. Perez advised her not to appear for her hearing on February 16, 1989. However, there is no evidence that her former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and given an opportunity to respond. The respondent also failed to submit a complaint to the State Bar of California regarding Mr. Perez. We note that there is no EOIR-28 form in the record of proceedings to indicate that Mr. Perez was representing the respondent before the Immigration Court. This is not a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel that may excuse strict compliance with the Lozada requirements. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (court found that alien had not substantially satisfied Lozada when he failed to submit an affidavit and could not prove that he gave former attorney notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond). Furthermore, while equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176; Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and she has failed to demonstrate reasonable cause for her failure to appear. Finally, despite the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of deportation dated February 16, 1989, the respondent waited almost 17 years before seeking to reopen her deportation proceedings.
 
The respondent also claims that she is eligible for relief pursuant to section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.43(c), an initial motion to reopen was due on September 11, 1998, and an application for suspension of deportation (Form I-881) had to be submitted by November 18, 1999. See 64 Fed. Reg. 40389-90 (July 26, 1999). The Immigration Judge and the Board are without authority to extend the time limits for filing a motion to reopen and a suspension application pursuant to section 203 of NACARA. The respondent has not submitted any evidence that she timely filed a motion to reopen pursuant to NACARA. On appeal the respondent indicates that she filed an application for relief under NACARA, but she does not state when it was filed, nor has she submitted a copy of her application. Therefore, the respondent failed to demonstrate that she timely filed an application for relief under NACARA by November 18, 1999. Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged that equitable tolling should be applied regarding her application for relief under NACARA. We note that precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that section 203(c) is a statute of limitations and is subject to equitable tolling. See Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.) (alien’s motion to reopen was deemed timely filed after establishing that equitable tolling applied due to ineffective assistance of counsel and alien had acted with due diligence in pursuing matter); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cr. 2003)(recognizing equitable tolling on motion to reopen during periods when alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien “acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002)(finding due diligence since new counsel promptly retained and motion to reopen filed after aliens learned conclusively that they had been misled by a non-attorney). We do not find that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shanta Ramson, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(A)º - Excludable at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C), I&N Act ¿ 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
This matter was last before the Board on December 19, 2005, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand, which was based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a motion “for the Board to reopen and reconsider its decision of December 19, 2005, and to stay deportation.” The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent previously argued to the Board that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his hearing. In our decision of December 19, 2005, we determined that the respondent failed to establish he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions because he failed to submit sufficient evidence to show there was a reasonable possibility the outcome of his case would have been different but for his former counsel’s performance.
 
To the extent the respondent now seeks reconsideration of the Board’s prior decision, the respondent has not specified errors of fact or law in that decision. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991) (noting that the very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard). The arguments made in support of reconsideration either concern issues that were not raised previously or that are based upon evidence not submitted previously.
 
First, the respondent argues that his former counsel should not have conceded the charge against him because the misrepresentation in his application for adjustment of status was not material. Specifically, the respondent asserts that the misrepresentation did not concern a deportable or excludable offense and that therefore, it was not material (Mot. at 3). The respondent also summarily declares that the misrepresentation (which concerned his arrest record) did not cut off a line of inquiry (Mot. at 3-4). These arguments however, are not properly raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider.
 
The respondent urges the Board to consider an affidavit from his sister-in-law dated January 17, 2006. In the affidavit the sister-in-law describes her assistance to the respondent in completing his application for adjustment of status. However, the respondent has not, in our view, adequately established that this affidavit was previously unavailable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent also contends that the Board erred in finding that he was in denial about his problems with alcohol abuse. As evidence to support his claim that he has addressed his problems with alcohol he submits, for the first time, a letter showing his completion of two alcohol safety programs. The letter states that the respondent was referred to one program on January 5, 1998, and completed it on January 5, 1999. He was referred again on April 28, 1999, with a completion date of August 1, 2000. The respondent has not explained why the evidence was not submitted with his motion to remand. Moreover, even if the letter showing the respondent’s completion of alcohol safety programs had been submitted earlier, it would not have supported the respondent’s allegation that he has seriously addressed his problems with alcohol. We find it significant that the respondent was referred to a second alcohol safety program only a few months after completing the first one. Furthermore, we again note our concern that at his hearing, the respondent was asked about the most recent incident in which he drank to excess and then entered into an argument with his wife (Tr. at 80). He testified that it was a long time ago and he did not remember (Tr. at 80). His wife then testified that it was only a few months earlier, while the respondent was in these proceedings, that he became intoxicated and broke and bloodied her nose (Tr. at 101-02, 110-12). She further testified that the respondent’s mother and sister-in-law tried to apologize for the respondent’s actions by saying the respondent was upset about being in immigration proceedings (Tr. at 112). The respondent admitted on appeal that his wife’s testimony was true. The letter submitted by the respondent with his current motion does not convince us that we need to revisit our conclusions concerning the respondent’s problems with alcohol.
 
*2 The respondent also contends that the Board failed to consider a number of significant factors before concluding that he did not establish the requisite hardship to his wife if he were deported. We have reviewed our prior decision in light of the arguments made by the respondent in his appeal and his motion to remand and we find no error in our decision in this regard.
 
Finally, the respondent contends there is new evidence that should be considered in terms of his claim of hardship to his wife. We have considered the new evidence that the respondent’s wife (whose affidavit has been submitted) is now under great stress because her parents are ill and because when the couple’s youngest child was sick she realized she could not properly take care of her family if the respondent were deported. We have also considered the claim of the respondent’s wife that the family is financially dependent on the respondent and may even end up in a homeless shelter without his financial support. The respondent’s wife has not indicated in her affidavit how her circumstances have substantially changed, from a financial standpoint, since she testified that the hardship to the family from the respondent’s departure would not be financial so much as emotional, given her own job skills and intent to return to work (Tr. at 104). Additionally, the wife’s stress from knowing that her father would be disappointed by the break-up of the family is not new evidence and not sufficient to support a motion to reopen. Finally, although she indicates in the affidavit that her youngest child suffers from various illnesses, there is no medical evidence that the child suffers from ongoing problems that would prevent the respondent’s wife from returning to work. We do not find the new evidence of hardship sufficient to meet the heavy burden that the respondent has to establish his proceedings should be reopened. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110 (1988); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Furthermore, the respondent has not presented arguments or evidence to convince us that our decision concerning denial of a waiver of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion should be revisited.
 
Accordingly, the motions will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion for reconsideration is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for reopening is denied.

IN RE: JUAN MANUEL OROZCO-SOLIS
File: AXX XX7 979 - Portland
April 11, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David N. Shomloo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 14, 2002, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 1999, decision denying the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §1239.2(f), so that he could proceed to a final hearing on his naturalization application. On October 13, 2005, more than three years after we issued a final administrative order in this case, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
This case presents three issues: first, whether equitable tolling applies in this case; second, whether we should exercise our sua sponte authority and reopen these proceedings on our own motion; and, third, whether the respondent has presented an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that justifies reopening. For the reasons stated below, we find that this case does not warrant equitable tolling, and, we would have reopened these proceedings on our own motion, but the respondent failed to present an ineffective assistance claim that warrants reopening. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
First, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
We do not find that the respondent’s situation falls within the Ninth Circuit’s equitable tolling policy for aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. The respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney, Mr. Job Valverde. While it appears that Mr. Valverde failed to inform the respondent of his right to file a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, order, the respondent failed to act with diligence when Mr. Valverde’s ineffectiveness became apparent. Despite Mr. Valverde’s failure to inform the respondent of his appeal rights, on September 18, 2002, the respondent filed a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, decision with the Ninth Circuit. On April 14, 2003, the Court denied the petition as untimely. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 15-18, 22. Even applying equitable tolling to his case, the clock began running at the latest on April 14, 2003. However, the respondent did not file his motion to reopen until October 13, 2005, more than two years later. The respondent could have personally filed a motion to reopen setting forth the facts of his case, but he failed to do so. The respondent did not act with due diligence.
 
*2 Second, the respondent asks that we reopen these proceedings on our own motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 12. In Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we held that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.
 
We find this case presents such exceptional circumstances due to a June 24, 2003, federal district court decision ordering the Attorney General to naturalize the respondent and declaring the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 1999, removal order null and void. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 24-34. The respondent’s motion to reopen is supported by documentation establishing that the respondent sought judicial review of the denial of his naturalization application pursuant to section 310(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1421(c). On June 24, 2003, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon found that the Immigration Judge erred in ordering the respondent removed from the United States. The District Court ordered that the respondent be naturalized. On August 4, 2005, the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court’s order based on its determination that a district court has no jurisdiction to review an Immigration Judge’s removal order. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 36-37.
 
We recognize that the District Court was reviewing the denial of the respondent’s naturalization application and that naturalization proceedings are separate and distinct from removal proceedings. Nevertheless, the District Court found that the respondent was erroneously ordered deported. That District Court order was not vacated until two years after it was issued. During that time, the respondent could reasonably believe that it was unnecessary to reopen these removal proceedings. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen shortly after the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court’s order. Given these exceptional circumstances, we would have reopened on our own motion if the respondent had established that he merited reopening. He failed to do so.
 
The respondent has failed to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that warrants reopening. The respondent asserts that his prior counsel, Mr. Valverde, provided ineffective assistance because he failed to advise the respondent of his right to file a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, decision. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8-10. The respondent has complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We find that Mr. Valverde provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to inform the respondent of his appeal rights. See Dearinger ex. rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2000). However, we find that the respondent failed to show that he was prejudiced by his inability to file a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, decision. See generally Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003). Initially, we observe that the ineffectiveness alleged by the respondent, that is, his inability to file a petition for review in federal court, is beyond the scope and jurisdiction of these administrative removal proceedings. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b), (c). The respondent does not show prejudice in the context of these removal hearings because he did not show that Mr. Valverde’s performance before the Immigration Judge or this Board was ineffective.
 
*3 Additionally, we find that the respondent failed to set forth any argument that might have been successful on appeal. The respondent seeks reopening so that we can reissue our decision and he can file a timely petition for review. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1. However, the respondent has not stated any plausible grounds for relief. He does not allege any factual or legal error in our August 28, 2003, decision which might be rectified on appeal. In sum, the respondent does not show prejudice since he failed to articulate any argument he would have presented on appeal and he failed to show that such argument might have been successful on appeal. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicolas Olano, Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated January 31, 2006. In her motion, the respondent avers that the Board mistakenly found that she did not comply with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, she contends that, in fact, her former counsel committed no error. Rather, she avers that the Immigration Court erred by telling her former counsel that he would be called by the Immigration Judge “in order to proceed with the hearing,” but did not do so (Motion at 3).
 
However, in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge found no merit to the respondent’s above-noted claim (I.J. at 5). In rendering this finding the Immigration Judge noted that at no time did the respondent identify the clerk with whom she allegedly spoke. This fact remains true to date. The Immigration Judge also noted that court staff members had no authority to grant motions filed with the Immigration Judge. The respondent has not addressed either of these findings in her motion to reconsider. Moreover, the respondent has not rebutted the Immigration Judge’s finding that her motions and the telephonic request were untimely submitted, and that she had an obligation to appear at her hearing.
 
We recognize that in the respondent’s motion to reopen former counsel averred that he called the court on the day of the hearing and was told by an unidentified clerk that he would be “called by the Immigration Judge later,” although a call never came (Motion at 2). However, it is well established that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of her responsibility to appear and, unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). A respondent should not assume that a motion for a change of venue will be granted particularly where, as here, it is filed in an untimely manner, merely three days before the scheduled hearing, and counsel only called to check on the status of that motion the day of the hearing. Matter of Rivera, supra. In this regard, we note that the Immigration Court opens at 8:00 a.m. and the respondent’s hearing was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. As such, her former counsel’s decision to not attend the hearing despite having at the most a mere hour after his phone call to ascertain whether a decision had been rendered, was, at best, exceptionally imprudent. Given this record, we find no error on the part of the Immigration Court.
 
*2 As noted, the respondent failed to satisfy the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In sum, we find no error on the part of the Board in dismissing the respondent’s appeal, and reconsideration is not warranted. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gene E. Hays, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathleen L. Alcorn
Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(9)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(9)(B)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on August 9, 2002, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On January 4, 2006, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen asking that the Board exercise its authority to reopen his case sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly, the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is both untimely and number-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent argues that the extraordinary remedy of sua sponte reopening is warranted because he has new evidence showing that his first marriage was entered into in good faith and because his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance. Although the respondent claims that sua sponte reopening is an exception to the regulation’s time and number limits, in essence, he is asking that we equitably toll the regulatory limits because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We find, however, that regardless of whether equitable tolling is available in this instance, the respondent has not exercised due diligence in discovering his prior attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance. Scorteanu v. INS, 339. F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir. 2003). Specifically, the respondent now alleges in an affidavit attached to a bar complaint against his former attorney that the attorney negligently represented him in various proceedings in 1989, 1998-1999 and 2002. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at Attachment E. Yet his first motion to reopen filed in 2002, with the assistance of a new attorney, makes no mention of any alleged attorney negligence. When the respondent consulted with a new attorney in 2002 he reasonably should have discovered any negligence on the part of his former attorney. Yet, the respondent has not raised such a claim until 4 years after the first motion to reopen was filed and has provided no explanation for the delay. As such, we find that such an inordinate delay was unjustified and reflects a lack of due diligence on the respondent’s part. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion requesting the exercise of our sua sponte reopening authority is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening; stay
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on June 24, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s previous motion to reopen and reconsider our June 25, 2003, decision. The respondent has filed a second untimely motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
We note that a party may only file one motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s current motion to reopen must be denied as it is number-barred, and it does not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions to the number restriction on motions to reopen.. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). In addition, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied because it is untimely. A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the instant case, the final administrative decision was rendered on June 25, 2003, and our last decision (relating the prior motion to reopen) was rendered 7 months before the filing of the respondent’s current motion to reopen. The respondent does not fall within any of the exceptions relating to the filing deadline for such motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3).
 
Concerning the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we have held that such a claim may form the basis of a motion to reopen. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in which jurisdiction the instant case arises, has held that, in order for an alien to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, he or she would have to prove prejudice to his or her case. See Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717, 724 (6th Cir. 2003). Here, we find that the respondent has failed to sufficiently establish that his former counsel’s actions resulted in prejudice to his case.
 
*2 In order to establish prejudice, and in order to warrant reopening, the respondent would have to show that the evidence presented is likely to change the result in his case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). The respondent claims that he retained his former counsel after we issued our June 25, 2003, decision. The respondent avers that his former counsel should have filed a motion to reopen requesting that he be given an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under the LIFE Act, as a legalization applicant, before the Immigration Judge. However, we note that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), not the Immigration Judge, has jurisdiction over processing such legalization application and related adjustment applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245a.12; see also 66 FR 29661-02. The only remedy or relief available before the Immigration Court or the Board, relating to a pending LIFE legalization application and a LIFE legalization adjustment of status application, is the administrative closure of proceedings, or the continuance of a motion, in order to allow the continued pursuit of such applications with the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245a.12(b). However, in order to obtain administrative closure, a case must still be pending. Thus, as we had already rendered our decision regarding the respondent’s appeal, administrative closure was not available to the respondent at the time that he hired his former counsel. Regarding the indefinite continuance of a motion, it is necessary that the DHS concur with Such action. Id. Here, the DHS has indicated that it opposes the respondent’s motion to reopen and has further indicated that it does not believe that the respondent has demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment under the LIFE legalization provisions. See DHS opposition. Hence, even if the respondent’s current motion, were not time and number barred, we would not indefinitely continue the respondent’s motion, which is the only remedy available after a final administrative decision has been rendered and while such applications are pending with DHS. Thus, prejudice has not been sufficiently established and reopening is not warranted in this case.
 
We note that the respondent was not prevented from submitting his LIFE legalization application, nor his corresponding application for adjustment, as the respondent asserts in his affidavit that both applications were already submitted to the DHS long before the respondent hired. the former counsel in question. In fact, he states that his adjustment of status application, based on his LIFE legalization application, was filed on or about June 28, 2002, which is after the Immigration Judge issued his decision and prior to the date that we issued our decision pertaining to the respondent’s appeal. Thus, the respondent has not been deprived of an opportunity to pursue such relief. We further note that, if such application for adjustment of status under LIFE legalization is still pending (the respondent, in his affidavit, indicates that the adjustment application is still pending), then the respondent (unless found ineligible) “may not be deported or removed from the United States.” See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1245a.13(a), 1245a.13(c). Thus, even after the respondent’s order of removal became effective, his LIFE legalization adjustment application would continue to be processed and the pendency of such application will result in a stay of deportation or removal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1245a.13(f). Id. (a stay will be in effect, while the LIFE legalization adjustment application is pending, unless the District Director makes a formal determination that the applicant does not present a prima facie claim). Hence, as previously indicated, we note that no prejudice, resulting from the respondent’s former counsel’s actions, has been established and reopening is not warranted in this case.
 
*3 Regarding the respondent’s request for a stay of removal, we will not grant such request, as it should be automatically granted by the DHS if the respondent’s LIFE legalization adjustment application is still pending as he claims. 8 C.F.R. § 1245a.13(f). No evidence was submitted indicating whether the respondent’s LIFE legalization adjustment application is in fact still pending. Thus we will leave that up to DHS to determine.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen and his request for a stay are both denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on July 21, 1997, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s November 25, 1996, decision after finding that the respondent was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On February 24, 2006, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen which was rejected because it was not accompanied by the required filing fee or fee waiver request. The respondent subsequently perfected his motion. With his motion, he also requested a stay of deportation which the Board denied on March 7, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the respondent’s motion. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent seeks reopening in order to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act. The respondent contends that he received ineffective assistance from his Legal Aid Society criminal defense attorney in that his attorney incorrectly advised him that there would be no immigration consequences if he pled guilty.¿FN1º The respondent advises that he has filed a motion to vacate his sentence with the New York state court based upon this ineffective assistance of counsel claim and provides a copy of that motion which shows that it was filed on March 1, 2006.
 
First, the motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s July 21, 1997, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The facts, circumstances, and immigration consequences following his April 26, 1996, guilty plea have been know to him since our 1997 decision. The respondent fails to explain why he did not pursue relief before the state court at an earlier time. We note that the respondent’s motion appears to have been motivated by his having been apprehended and detained by DHS officials on February 9, 2006, after which he filed a motion to vacate his conviction with the New York state court. This event does not alter the fact that his motion to reopen is untimely and does not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions to the time restrictions for motions to reopen. Furthermore, the respondent’s conviction has not been vacated by the New York state Court. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Guadagno, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen so that he may pursue an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. We will grant the motion sua sponte pursuant to the authority described in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent argues that he was afforded ineffective assistance during proceedings that concluded with the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 29, 2004. The respondent argues that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to advise him of the ramifications of waiving appeal, thus resulting in a waiver that was not knowing and voluntary. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Here, the respondent has submitted evidence that establishes that he was not provided effective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted evidence that his counsel was representing him in immigration proceedings even though he was disbarred on June 10, 2004, six weeks prior to the respondent’s hearing that resulted in waiving appeal. As we find that the respondent’s waiver of appeal was not a valid and knowledgeable waiver, we find that the respondent did not waive appeal. Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74, 76 (BIA 2001) (ability of a party to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver). Accordingly, proceedings are ordered reopened.
 
We find that the record reveals that the respondent’s counsel failed to understand a basic distinction regarding eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act which resulted in prejudice to the respondent. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The transcript indicates that the respondent’s attorney failed to point out the distinction regarding the termination of continuous physical presence as it relates to eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act. Tr. at 33-37. The respondent’s conviction does not terminate the accrual of continuous physical presence for section 212(c) purposes, yet the respondent’s counsel’s failure to establish that distinction resulted in the respondent’s inability to seek such relief.¿FN1º As the respondent has submitted evidence that he is prima facie eligible for relief that was not considered by the Immigration Judge, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on the respondent’s eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Termination of removal proceedings
 
This case was last before us on October 22, 2004, when we returned the record to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a full decision pursuant to Matter of A-P, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). In a written decision, dated January 13, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate his removal proceedings, finding that a state court’s order vacating the respondent’s conviction was of no effect for immigration purposes. The respondent has appealed from this decision. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained.
 
The record reflects that on August 22, 2003, the Georgia State court vacated the respondent’s conviction in violation of V.G.C.S.A. Possession of Cocaine on the grounds that the respondent’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated and that the guilty plea was not entered in a knowing and voluntary fashion of both state and federal constitutional standards of due process of law. We conclude that this state action vitiates the respondent’s conviction for immigration purposes, necessitating termination of the removal proceedings. See Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000); see also Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (finding that a conviction vacated for failure of the trial court to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes).
 
We take due note of the arguments of the DHS opposing termination of the proceedings by reference to Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). We conclude, however, that the instant case is not governed by Matter of Pickering because the Georgia court order at issue here does not reflect that the respondent’s conviction was set aside for reasons solely related to post-conviction events such as rehabilitation or immigration hardships. Instead, the respondent’s conviction was vacated because of constitutional and procedural errors during the criminal proceedings. Accordingly, we conclude that we must give full faith and credit to this state court judgment. Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, supra, at 1380.
 
*2 We also note the DHS’s reliance on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals’ decisions in United States v. Campbell, 778 F.2d 764 (11th Cir. 1985) (finding that failure to advise an alien defendant of the deportation consequences did not require that defendant be permitted to withdraw her guilty plea), and Downs-Morgan v. United States, 765 F.2d 1534 (11th Cir. 1985) (noting that an affirmative misrepresentation by counsel in response to a specific inquiry about the possibility of deportation, resulting in a plea of guilty, does not necessarily constitute ineffective assistance of counsel). However, we find that these cases, which involve federal convictions, are not dispositive of cases, such as the respondent’s before us, arising in State court in which the court has vacated the conviction. We also note that the DHS has not established that the Georgia State court lacked jurisdiction to enter an order vacating the respondent’s conviction below.
 
Because the Georgia trial court’s action of vacating the respondent’s conviction on constitutional and due process grounds has the effect of vacating the respondent’s criminal conviction for immigration purposes, the respondent is not removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). Therefore, termination of the respondent’s proceedings is proper. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated March 1, 2005, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is granted, and the respondent’s removal proceedings are terminated.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Stender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda I. Spencer-Walters
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This is the fifth time that the respondent’s case has been before the Board. In a May 21, 2003, decision, an Immigration Judge granted voluntary departure to the respondent after finding her ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to show that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative, as required. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on July 1, 2004. We denied previous motions to reopen on October 18, 2004; March 25, 2005, and June 15, 2005. The pending motion to reopen, filed on November 22, 2005, was filed late. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the motion exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen. Id. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent brings claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorneys who represented her at the immigration hearing and concerning the first two motions filed in this case. However, the respondent submitted her April 25, 2005, motion, which we denied on June 15, 2005, pro se. She fails to state when she consulted current counsel. We find no basis to either equitably toll the motions deadline, or accept the motion under our sua sponte authority.
 
In any event, a respondent claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from her attorney’s failure. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent states that her attorney, Tony Guajardo, should have better prepared her case for cancellation of removal, and should have called her husband as a witness (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 13). However, the respondent fails to show what evidence was thereby omitted that would have caused the Immigration Judge to reach a different result concerning the cancellation application. The motion asserts that former counsel told the respondent’s husband not to submit an immediate relative visa petition. Id. Had the visa petition been filed, the Immigration Judge still would not have granted cancellation of removal to an individual with young, “easily adaptable” children (I.J. at 9).
 
*2 The respondent argues that her case should be reopened based on an October 6, 2005, memorandum by the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement Principal Legal Advisor (Respondent’s Mot., at Exh. 8). That memorandum concerns instances in which the DHS may exercise prosecutorial discretion to dismiss proceedings. That the DHS might dismiss a pending case in its discretion under certain circumstances provides no basis for reopening of these proceedings.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Enrique Arevalo, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 25, 1998. According to the regulations, a motion to reopen must be filed with the Board within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). In the instant case, the motion to reopen was required to have been filed no later than May 25, 1998. Id. The motion to reopen was not filed until January 31, 2006. Therefore, it is untimely. Id.; see also section 101(a)(47) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47) (defining final order of deportation); Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5 (BIA 2001).
 
The respondent requests that the Board reopen proceedings sua sponte based upon exceptional circumstances. In Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the Board held that its power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. Matter of J-J-, supra. We not find that the moving party has demonstrated exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening sua sponte. Id. Here, the respondent contends that due to fraud relating to his 1996 motion to reopen, his current motion should not be time or numbers barred in light of Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). We do not find the respondent’s reliance on Varela v. INS, supra, to be persuasive. We first note that the alien in Varela, supra, filed a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel within one month of finding out that his first motion to reopen was denied. Here, the record reflects that the respondent was represented by his current counsel as early as July 21, 1998 when his current counsel assisted in filing a visa petition on the respondent’s behalf (Form I-797C). Neither the respondent nor his counsel has adequately established why a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel was not filed in 1998 or why the respondent and his counsel waited over 6 years before filing the instant motion to reopen. Therefore, we do not find sufficient reason for equitably tolling the time or number limits set forth in the regulations. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (equitable tolling applies “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering” the misconduct) (emphasis added).
 
*2 In addition, the alien in Varela, supra, complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), by filing a complaint with the California State Association and sending a letter to lawyer who had employed the notary. Here, while the respondent has submitted an affidavit and filed a complaint with the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office about the notary, the respondent did not file a complaint against the attorney employing the notary with the.California State Bar Association or provide evidence that the notary or the lawyer employing the notary was notified about the complaint. Therefore, the respondent has not substantially complied with the Lozada requirements.
 
As we find that the respondent has not met his burden to establish exceptional circumstances to warrant sua sponte reopening, we need not reach the respondent’s contention that he remains eligible for adjustment of status as he did not receive the oral advisements set forth in section 242B(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252B(e).
 
Accordingly, the motion reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pasquale Lombardo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Martin Magat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
At a hearing held on February 14, 2005, the respondent admitted the allegations and conceded the charge, was ordered removed to Mexico, and was removed on February 15, 2005. He re-entered the United States illegally on February 17, 2005, and was placed into proceedings on August 9, 2005. On September 9, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings with the Immigration Court, and claimed ineffective assistance of counsel for his previous deportation.
 
The motion to reopen was granted on October 3, 2005. The Government filed a motion to reconsider this decision on October 7, 2005, which was granted on November 1, 2005. The Immigration Judge granted the Government’s motion because she found there were errors of law in the previous order. She found that the Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion to reopen, citing 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1) and 1003.44(k), because the respondent had already been deported under an executed warrant of deportation, and had re-entered the United States in violation of law. She also reinstated the 2005 Notice to Appear. This appeal of the Immigration Judge’s grant of the motion to reconsider followed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the ineffective assistance of counsel arose when his former attorney failed to advise him that he was eligible to adjust status, based on his marriage to a United States citizen. This resulted in his being ordered removed and his removal from the United States. He argues that the Immigration Judge improperly concluded that she lacked jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion to reopen, based on 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1) and 1003.44(k). He argues that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) is ultra vires, because it lacks statutory authority, and is incompatible with a statutory scheme that authorizes motions to reopen to apply for newly acquired relief. He also argues that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k) is inapplicable to the respondent’s case, as it governs motions to reopen to apply for section 212(c) relief for certain aliens. In addition, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred when she found that there were no cases to support the proposition that a motion to reopen could be granted after an alien has been deported.
 
*2 The Government argues that the respondent was not prejudiced by his former attorney’s ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to apply for adjustment of status, as the respondent is now again before the Immigration Judge and may seek adjustment of status, the same relief he seeks from the Board in his motion to reopen. The DHS also argues that the respondent’s motion to reopen was not timely, and that equitable tolling does not apply in his case.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision granting the Government’s motion to reconsider was correct, and agree that the Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction to grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, as the motion had been filed after the respondent was deported from the United States, in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
As far as the respondent’s argument that the Attorney General’s regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(i) is ultra vires to the Act, we lack the authority to make such a ruling, and decline to consider such an argument. See Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991) (stating that it is “well-settled that it is not within the province of this Board to pass on the validity of the statutes and regulations we administer”).
 
We also find that the cases cited by the respondent for the proposition that there is jurisdiction to consider a motion to reopen after an alien is deported to be distinguishable from the instant case. Specifically, in Mendez v. INS, 563 F.2d 956, 958 (9th Cir. 1977), it was held that the jurisdictional bars in the regulation on reopening would apply only where the “departure” was a “legally executed” one. In that case the government’s deportation of an alien whose criminal conviction had been vacated without notice to counsel, was held to have stripped the deportation proceeding of its legality. See also Estrada-Rosales v. INS, 645 F.2d 819 (9th Cir. 1981)(deportation based on invalid conviction could not be deemed “legally executed”). Similarly, in Wiedersperg v. INS, 896 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir. 1990), it was held that an alien was entitled to reopen proceedings after he had been deported, where his state conviction, which was the sole ground of deportation, was vacated. The Court found in that case that the alien’s deportation was not legally executed. The respondent argues that his removal likewise cannot be considered a legally executed “departure” from the United States, as he claims that ineffective assistance of counsel prevented him from filing for adjustment of status, and had this filing occurred, he would have avoided removal. We do not agree that these situations are comparable. Unlike the aliens in Mendez and Wiedersperg, whose removals relied on criminal convictions, the respondent’s previous removal was based on his being in the United States illegally, and there was no issue with regard to burden of proof to establish the charge of inadmissibility in 212(a)(6)(A)(i)(present without admission or parole). Hence, it appears the respondent’s departure was “legally executed”. Therefore, the jurisdictional bars in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) would apply in this case to block the granting of the respondent’s motion to reopen filed after he was deported.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Conlon, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves to reopen our August 26, 1997, decision which dismissed his appeal. The respondent contends that his prior counsel, Merrick Dammar, Esquire, committed ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to properly argue that he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) notwithstanding the fact that he had been convicted after a jury trial. The respondent contends, in the alternative, that the Board should reissue its July 7, 2005, decision denying his motion to reopen because Mr. Dammar failed to file an EOIR-33 appearance form to ensure that the Board had the respondent’s current address, and Mr. Dammar failed to inform the respondent that the Board had denied his motion in a timely manner so that he could have filed a timely petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
 
On July 7, 2005, this Board denied the respondent’s first motion to reopen which was filed on his behalf by Mr. Dammar. In our last decision we noted that the respondent was not eligible for a section 212(c) waiver because his conviction resulted from a jury trial, rather than from a plea. The respondent contends that pursuant to Restrepo v. McElroy, 369 F.3d 627 (2d Cir. 2004), he was eligible for 212(c) relief and his prior counsel was ineffective for failing to raise his eligibility for such relief. We disagree. Restrepo must be considered in light of INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), and other Second Circuit precedent, as well as the special 212(c) regulation. On April 24, 1996, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (“AEDPA”). Section 440(d) provides that aliens who are deportable by reason of a conviction for certain offenses are statutorily ineligible for section 212(c) relief. Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court determined that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to aliens who pled guilty prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of the AEDPA. See INS v. St. Cyr, supra. The St. Cyr decision specifically focused on plea agreements, and only the reliance interest of those aliens pleading guilty to crimes when section 212(c) was available were sufficiently strong to warrant continued eligibility for relief. See also 69 Fed. Reg. 57826, 57828.
 
*2 Consistent with St. Cyr, the new section 212(c) regulation states that it applies to convictions obtained by plea agreements reached prior to a verdict at trial prior to April 1, 1997. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(a). Similarly, the Second Circuit has held that an alien who is convicted after trial is not eligible for section 212(c) relief under St. Cyr. See Rankine v. Reno, 319 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2003); Theodoropoulos v. INS, 313 F.3d 732, 739-40 (2d Cir. 2002). As the Second Circuit explained, aliens who go to trial do not rely on the availability of section 212(c) relief, but rather on their claim of innocence and criminal law considerations. Rankine v. Reno, supra at 102.
 
In Restrepo v. McElroy, supra, the Second Circuit acknowledged another type of reliance sufficiently strong to warrant relief. The alien in Restrepo claimed that AEDPA was impermissibly retroactive because when he was convicted in 1992, INS regulations permitted him to file an affirmative application for section 212(c) relief, but he decided to wait in reliance on his ability to apply for section 212(c) relief at a later time when his equities such as rehabilitation and community ties were stronger. The Second Circuit held that “¿iºt seems equally clear that the AEDPA’s undermining of this settled expectation represents a prototypical case of retroactivity”… “like the aliens in St. Cyr, who sacrificed something of value.” Restrepo v. McElroy, supra, at 634.
 
Although the Restrepo court held that the alien’s argument was valid, it did not decide whether the alien himself could claim the benefit of this argument. Restrepo v. McElroy, supra, at 639-40. Rather, the case was remanded with directions that the district court decide, in the first instance, whether the alien must make an individualized showing of reliance, or whether, instead, a categorical presumption of reliance by any alien who might have applied for 212(c) relief when it was available, but did not do so, was more appropriate. Id. Consequently, Restrepo does not extend the categorical approach of St. Cyr to convictions after trial.1
 
In an opinion issued after Restrepo, the Second Circuit reaffirmed its decision in Rankine, holding that an alien’s decision to contest his murder charges at trial did not give rise to a reasonable reliance or a settled expectation as to the availability of section 212(c) relief. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369 F.3d 158, 163 (2d Cir. 2004). And since the alien did not claim any other basis for such a reliance or expectation, see, e.g., Restrepo, the Second Circuit held that the IIRIRA and the AEDPA may be applied retroactively to the alien. Thom v. Ashcroft, supra, at 163.
 
*3 In the instant case since the respondent’s conviction was after a trial, and he did not satisfy the narrow criteria set out in Restrepo for 212(c) eligibility, he has failed to show that his prior counsel was ineffective in representing him in his motion to reopen.
 
However, we shall grant the respondent’s motion to reissue based upon the record, and the fact that he has filed a detailed affidavit in which he recounts that his prior counsel failed to inform him of the Board’s July 7, 2005, decision. In this regard we note that prior counsel failed to file a Notice of Appearance (EOIR-27) before the Board, our last decision was sent to an apparently out of date address, and the record reflects that the decision was returned.
 
ORDER: The Board’s order of July 7, 2005, in this matter is hereby vacated and the proceedings reinstated upon the Board’s own motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). A final order in the matter is hereby issued as of this date, incorporating by reference the text of the attached vacated order.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

And on remand the district court did not reach the question because the government established that, as of the date of the deportation order, the alien had already served 5 years in prison and was therefore statutorily ineligible for section 212(c) relief. Based on this information, the district court held that the alien was not in the category of aliens who reasonably relied on the continued availability of section 212(c) because he had no reason to postpone filing for so long that he became statutorily ineligible for relief by triggering the 5-year bar. Since the alien was statutorily ineligible for relief, the district court declined to issue an advisory opinion with respect to the issues raised by the Second Circuit. See Restrepo v. McElroy, 354 F.Supp.2d 254 (E.D.N.Y. 2005). The respondent contends that the Board should decide this issue, which we decline to do. It is well settled that we lack jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of the Act and the regulations that we adjudicate. See Matter of Gonzales-Camarillo, 21 I&N Dec. 937 (BIA 1997); Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529 (BIA 1992).

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act, ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated September 30, 2004, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand asserting eligibility for adjustment of status and ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be sustained. The record of proceeding will be remanded.
 
The respondent was served, via regular mail, with a Notice to Appear on July 23, 2003, charging her as removable under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i). On February 18, 2004, the respondent, through counsel, conceded removability and requested adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, and in the alternative voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The Immigration Judge then reset the case to April 16, 2004, to allow the respondent to file her application for adjustment of status and supporting documentation. However, on April 16, 2004, the respondent appeared with counsel but the application was not completed for filing before the Immigration Judge. As a result, the Immigration Judge continued the case until the afternoon of April 16, 2004, to allow the respondent another opportunity to appear with the completed application ready to be filed. However, the respondent failed to reappear and file her application with the Immigration Judge. As a consequence, on April 16, 2004, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s request for adjustment of status abandoned but granted the respondent voluntary departure, for 60 days.
 
On April 20, 2004, the respondent, through counsel filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge asserting that he failed to timely file the application due to his own health problems as well as traffic delays. The Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) filed, on September 17, 2004, a motion expressing non-opposition to the respondent’s motion to reconsider. Thereafter, on September 30, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider finding that the respondent was ineligible for adjustment of status because she had overstayed her 60-day grant of voluntary departure. The respondent, through new counsel, simultaneously filed two Notices of Appeal (NOA) on October 29, 2004. The first NOA addressed the Immigration Judge’s decision issued on April 16, 2004, granting voluntary departure. The second NOA addressed the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated September 30, 2004, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
*2 On March 11, 2005, the Board dismissed the respondent’s NOA regarding the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated April 16, 2004, because it was untimely and the Board lacked jurisdiction. The NOA addressing the denial of the motion to reconsider is currently before the Board for adjudication. The respondent asserts in her appeal pending before the Board that: (1) the Immigration Judge abused her discretion by imposing voluntary departure on the respondent without the consent of the respondent; (2) the Immigration Judge erred as a matter of law by imposing voluntary departure on the respondent without the respondent’s consent because the respondent was not in possession of a valid passport; (3) The Immigration Judge abused her discretion by waiting more than 4 months to issue a decision on her motion to reconsider; (4) the Immigration Judge erroneously denied the motion to reconsider based on the respondent overstaying her grant of voluntary departure; and, (5) the respondent was provided ineffective assistance by prior counsel.
 
The respondent’s first two arguments that the Immigration Judge erred as a matter of discretion and as a matter of law when she imposed voluntary departure on the respondent are improperly before the Board. Those arguments address the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated April 16, 2004. However, the respondent failed to file a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision issued on April 16, 2004. Consequently, the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated April 16, 2004 was a final decision. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). By waiving appeal, an alien relinquishes the opportunity to obtain review of the Immigration Judge’s ruling. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000). Therefore, the Board is without jurisdiction to address the issues regarding the Immigration Judge’s decision issued on April 16, 2004. See Matter of Shih, supra. Likewise, the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion by waiting 4 months to render a decision on the motion to reconsider is without merit. The respondent provided no legal basis whatsoever for her assertion that a delay of 4 months is necessarily an abuse of discretion.
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reconsider due to her overstaying voluntary departure is erroneous. We agree. Section 240B(d) of the Act provides that if an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily and she fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, then the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under this section and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249. However, section 240B(d) of the Act also provides that the order permitting the alien to depart voluntarily shall inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection. In this case, the Immigration Judge entirely failed to advise the respondent of the consequences of failing to depart within the time period specified. The consequences of failing to depart were not provided in the Immigration Judge’s decision or during removal proceedings. As such, the respondent was not barred from seeking adjustment of status. See Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reconsider is erroneous, will be vacated, and remanded to the Immigration Judge to adjudicate the motion anew.1 Since the record of proceeding will be remanded to the Immigration Judge, it is not necessary to address the respondent’s motion which also seeks a remand.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and the record of proceeding will be remanded in accordance with the above decision.

It should be noted that while the motion was titled a “Motion to Reconsider,” the motion was also accompanied by evidence. As such, the motion was also a motion to reopen and should be construed as such. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).

IN RE: BLANCA FUNES-CORPENO
File: AXX XX5 606 - Los Angeles
March 8, 2006
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claudia J. Lopez, Esquire
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 15, 2005, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration judge had previously denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for adjustment of status pursuant to section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act. (NACARA). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure on July 19, 1990. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on May 10, 2005, which was denied by the Immigration Judge in June 21, 2005. On June 30, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider, in which she claimed that she had filed a timely motion to reopen pursuant to the NACARA, but she could not recall if she filed an application for relief by November 18, 1999. The respondent submitted a copy of her NACARA motion to reopen which indicates that it was filed on September 8, 1998. Therefore, the respondent timely filed a motion to reopen pursuant to NACARA. However, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider, as she failed to demonstrate that she timely filed application for relief under NACARA by November 18, 1999.
 
On appeal the respondent now alleges that equitable tolling should be applied in her case, as her legal representative failed to inform her of her obligation to file her application for relief under NACARA. She contends that had sought the assistance of a non-profit organization in her community, and that it had failed to provide her with adequate notice of her responsibility to file an application for relief under NACARA by November 18, 1999. The respondent also asserts that she acted with due diligence, as she believed that her motion to reopen was still pending before the Immigration Court, and that is why she continued to receive her work permit. She states that it was not until she sought the assistance of current counsel in April 2005, that she was made aware of the denial of her September 1998 motion to reopen, and of her duty to file the application for relief by November 18, 1999. She subsequently filed a motion to reopen in May 2005.
 
Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that section 203(c) is a statute of limitations and is subject to equitable tolling. See Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.) (alien’s motion to reopen was deemed timely filed after establishing that equitable tolling applied due to ineffective assistance of counsel and alien had acted with due diligence in pursuing matter); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d. 889, 897 (9th Cr. 2003) (recognizing equitable tolling on motion to reopen during periods when alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien “acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002)(finding due diligence since new counsel promptly retained and motion to reopen filed after aliens learned conclusively that they had been misled by a non-attorney).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent is now alleging ineffective assistance of counsel as the basis for her failure to timely file an application for relief under NACARA. She also contends that equitable tolling should apply, as her legal representatives failed to inform her of her obligation to file an application for relief by November 18, 1999. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal, including her declaration. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Furthermore, we find that a remand is not warranted in this case. The respondent filed two motions before the Immigration Judge, and she failed to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in either motion. We note that while equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176; Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). The respondent asserts that she timely filed a motion to reopen in September 1998, but she was unaware that an application had to be filed by November 18, 1999. She states that she believed that the filing of the motion to reopen was sufficient to have her case reopened. The respondent states that not until she had the financial means to seek legal assistance was she made aware of her obligation file the application by November 18, 1999. However, there is no indication that the respondent ever inquired with the Immigration Court regarding the status of her motion to reopen, nor did she seek the assistance of legal counsel for more than six years after filing the motion to reopen. We also note that the respondent failed to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel until the filing of her appellate brief on October 5, 2005. Consequently, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence in pursuing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, we do not find that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Osberg-Braun, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Loren G. Coy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
In an oral decision dated October 11, 2005, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, and denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent appealed from that decision, and subsequently filed a motion to remand. The motion will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, was admitted to the United states as a lawful permanent resident on January 30, 1972 (Exh. 1; Tr. at 73-74). She was convicted in the Circuit Court, Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Dade County, Florida of petit larceny in violation of Florida Statute 812.014(3) on October 23, 1986, March 4, 1987, May 10, 1991, December 5, 1997, January 16, 1998, and May 6, 2003 (Exhs. 1, 4, 8; Tr. at 8-9, 13-14, 32-33, 53, 63-64, 67, 76-77; 79-81, 87-89). In addition, the respondent was arrested and charged with burglary of an occupied dwelling, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony following an altercation with her ex-husband’s girlfriend on January 13, 1987 (Exh. 8; Tr. at 26-27, 81-85). Although the respondent was never prosecuted on these charges, the court issued a domestic violence injunction ordering her to stay away from the victim (Exh. 8; Tr. at 27, 85). The respondent was arrested for violating this injunction on February 5, 1992 (Exh. 8; Tr. at 86-87, 90).
 
In an October 11, 2005, decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, and denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act in the exercise of discretion (I.J. at 5-7). Based on the evidence available at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, we agree that the respondent did not merit a grant of cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. We find that the Immigration Judge properly noted the respondent’s positive factors, but agree that these did not outweigh her criminal history and her failure to show genuine rehabilitation for her criminal record. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978).
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based upon her claim that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, and was deprived of due process because of faulty equipment used during her video conference hearing. Although the respondent submitted evidence showing that she complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), she failed to establish that she suffered any prejudice due to her former counsel’s actions. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 533 (BIA 2003). The respondent maintains that her former attorney erred in failing to apply for asylum and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). Strategic decisions on how best to proceed in a case are not necessarily grounds for ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, the respondent has offered no evidence in her motion to establish that she would have prevailed on these applications. Finally, we find unpersuasive the respondent’s assertion that she was deprived of due process as a result of faulty equipment used during the video conference hearing. The respondent failed to raise any concerns or objections regarding the equipment during the hearing, and has not identified any errors or prejudice flowing from the alleged technical difficulties.
 
*2 In her motion, the respondent also maintains that newly obtained evidence establishes that she is entitled to a grant of cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. She suggests that she may be suffering from kleptomania, and has submitted various letters and articles in support of her claim. Because there has been no formal diagnosis of kleptomania in this case, we find that the evidence pertaining to this disorder is immaterial. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Finally, the respondent reported that her 87-year-old United States citizen mother was discharged from a mental hospital on October 7, 2005, and explained that she is suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease and is in need of constant care. She submitted medical evidence from the hospital confirming that her mother “requires 24 hour supervision to be safe in the community,” as well as affidavits from family members explaining that the respondent is the only person capable of providing the required care. We agree with the respondent that this evidence regarding her mother’s current medical condition is material in the balancing of the equities in this case. Consequently, we conclude that it is appropriate to remand the case to the Immigration Judge for consideration of this additional evidence.
 
On remand, the parties will be allowed an opportunity to present evidence regarding whether the respondent merits cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act as a matter of discretion. We note that the Immigration Judge’s decision should include clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barr, Kaaren L., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James S. Yi,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 26, 2005. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s September 7, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the State of Oregon, Jackson County, pursuant to a plea of guilty of violating Or. Stat. § 165.022, which makes it a crime for an individual to possess a forged instrument, qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude, rendering the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(b)(1)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b)(1)(C)); see also Jordan v. DeGeorge, 341 U.S. 223, 232 (1951); Matter of Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 225, 228 (BIA 1980) (holding that intent to defraud involves moral turpitude). This Board has held that possession of an altered immigration document with knowledge that it was altered, but without its use or proof of an intent to use it unlawfully, is not a crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Serna, 20 I&N Dec. 579 (BIA 1992). In Matter of Serna, supra, we focused on the lack of use and lack of intent to use the altered document unlawfully as the distinguishing characteristics setting that crime apart from those that involve moral turpitude. However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that, in the instant case, because the 2 counts to which the respondent pled guilty both stated that the respondent possessed the forged instrument “with intent to utter the instrument,” the conviction documents establish that the respondent intended to use the forged instrument (Exh. 2). Furthermore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not claimed any other form of relief from removal. Finally, we find no merit to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by her prior attorney because he failed to pursue other avenues of relief from removal. See Matter of B-B, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (holding that the degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair). Moreover, we observe that the respondent has not met all of the requirements for establishing such a claim as set forth under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SABRIJA MUJAJ
File: AXX XX6 959 - Hartford

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dr. T.H. Martland
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On October 27, 2005, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal because she had waived the right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The respondent filed a motion to reconsider, on November 29, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent now claims that former counsel pressured her into waiving her right to appeal. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). These cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zheng v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2005). In this case, the respondent’s affidavit is vague as to the agreement between herself and counsel, the attorney has not been allowed to respond, and no bar complaint has been filed. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.
