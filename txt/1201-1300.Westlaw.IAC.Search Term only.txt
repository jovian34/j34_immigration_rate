Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 By order dated August 15, 2008, the Board determined that it was appropriate to consider this matter on certification. At issue before the Board is whether the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order that was entered against him on April 5, 2007. More specifically, the question is whether the Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent had not shown exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the scheduled hearing such that reopening was warranted under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
We find that a remand is warranted. The respondent claimed that his failure to appear at the scheduled hearing was due to exceptional circumstances, i.e. the ineffective assistance of his prior attorney. Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y General, 514 F.3d 1224 (11th Cir. 2008); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s motion was timely and that he had substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nevertheless, he concluded that the respondent had not set forth exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the hearing. A remand is warranted, however, where the Immigration Judge did not fully consider all of the facts as set forth in the respondent’s affidavit (Motion, attachment 1) and did not make any particularized findings of fact with regard to the conclusion that the respondent had failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s conduct in his case. The Board has limited ability to engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). In addition, subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case, the United States Attorney General has clarified the standards that will be applied to claims of deficient performance of counsel (formerly referred to as ineffective assistance of counsel). Matter of Compean, Bangafy & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (AG. 2009). Based on the foregoing, we find it appropriate to remand this matter for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia D. Goodman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 30, 2008. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for any form of relief from removal. On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance cf counsel in complying with the requirements set forth by the Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship and Immigration Services (“DHS”) for pursuing a visa petition (Form I-130). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Under our de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). The respondent’s unsupported allegations fail to demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, to the extent that the respondent’s appellate argument is based upon allegations of ineffective assistance of the respondent’s counsel in his representation of the respondent before the DHS, regarding the respondent’s visa petition, the Board does not have jurisdiction to allow the respondent to seek recourse before the DHS for his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance. In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(1)(A)(iv), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(iv)º Drug abuser or addict (withdrawn)

APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent appeals from a March 22, 2007, Immigration Judge’s decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, pretermitted his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and granted the respondent voluntary departure. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has cross-appealed the grant of voluntary departure. The record will be remanded.
 
In rendering his decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance in order to file an application for cancellation of removal and to seek some reformative relief under the Act (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had been informed by a previous Immigration Judge to file his application on or before May 11, 2005, and at the October 11, 2005, hearing again informed of the need to file an application as well as comply with the biometric filing requirements by the next scheduled hearing date (Tr. at 22-23, 28, 30). The Immigration Judge concluded that based on the respondent’s admission that he was convicted in 1996 of possession of marijuana, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal, thus precluding him from a showing of good cause for a further continuance (I.J. at 7; Tr. at 16-17). On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance as he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to file the appropriate applications for relief or to pursue post-conviction relief with respect to his conviction. The DHS contends that based on the respondent’s convictions and admitted illicit drug use the Immigration Judge erred as a matter of discretion in granting the respondent voluntary departure.
 
The decision to grant or deny a continuance is committed to the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Thus, an Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion for a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent demonstrates that the denial deprived him of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Luviano, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). We conclude that the respondent did not make a persuasive showing of good cause for his requested continuance. The respondent had a valid “conviction” for immigration purposes, and his speculative collateral attack upon that conviction does not operate to negate its validity until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. See Matter of Onyido, 22 I&N Dec. 552 (BIA 1999). An Immigration Judge is not obliged to suspend properly-initiated removal proceedings indefinitely based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status.
 
*2 We note, however, that with his appeal the respondent has submitted evidence indicating that his 1996 drug possession conviction has been vacated pursuant to U.C.A. §§ 76-35a-101-108. In rendering the vacatur order, the Fourth District Court of Utah found the respondent’s conviction “was obtained or the sentence was imposed in violation of the United States Constitution or Utah Constitution.” Therefore, it is clear that the court’s action was premised upon what it perceived to be a constitutional infirmity in the underlying proceedings, rather than for rehabilitative reasons or reasons related to the respondent’s immigration status. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003); Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2005).
 
The vacatur of the respondent’s conviction occurred after the Immigration Judge issued his decision and has only come to light in the context of the respondent’s appeal of the denial of a continuance based upon ineffective assistance. This conviction was the basis for the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent was ineligible for cancellation of removal, and thus precluded him from showing good cause for a continuance. Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to determine the effect of the vacatur of the respondent’s conviction on his eligibility to apply for cancellation or removal and any other forms of relief for which he may be eligible. In light of the need to address the effect of the vacatur of the respondent’s conviction on his eligibility for relief, we will not address the DHS’ appeal of the grant of voluntary departure at this time.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal challenging the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a continuance is dismissed as moot and the record remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Barsamian, Esquire
*1 On October 30, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent, who is from the Dominican Republic, undeserving of a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). Before denying relief, the Immigration Judge balanced the respondent’s equities against his conviction for a drug offense. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on August 8, 2008. In affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge, the Board noted that the respondent “… has not presented any evidence to refute the evidence in record suggesting that he was a fugitive and that he never served his criminal sentence.” The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen on September 8, 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision setting forth standards for claims involving (what was formerly known as) ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (Matter of Compean).
 
The United States Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compean first found that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. Id. at 716-727. As to whether reopening is appropriate under the Board’s “broad discretion”, Matter of Compean, supra, at 728, the Attorney General set forth a “general framework” that the Board is to apply. Id. at 730. The Attorney General announced several substantive standards for evaluating such claims, now known as “deficient performance of counsel” claims, as well as evidentiary standards for such claims. Id. at 730-39.¿FN1º
 
As for substantive standards, under Matter of Compean, supra, at 733-35, an “alien must establish prejudice arising from the lawyer’s errors”, that is, an “alien must show that but for the deficient performance, it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking.” The respondent claims that counsel failed to prepare him for the hearing concerning relief under section 212(c) of the Act, and argues that documents such as tax returns were not presented (Respondent’s Mot., at pp. 4-6, 9; Respondent’s Affidavit). The motion also contends that former counsel should have submitted a memorandum arguing that the respondent was not convicted of a drug trafficking crime (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 8). Despite the respondent’s complaints against former counsel, he fails to present any of the evidence that he claims former counsel omitted, and he fails to show that but for counsel’s actions, it is more likely than not that relief under former section 212(c) of the Act would have been granted. Matter of Compean, supra, at 733-35. Therefore, the pending motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: ANNETTE SHAW
File: A073 215 311 - Miami, FL
March 19, 2009
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter Loblack, Esquire
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 22, 2008, denying her motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on June 14, 1995. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision in its entirety, for the following reasons.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that she did not receive notice of the hearing through no fault of her own. She also asserts that she was defrauded by an immigration consultant posing as an attorney, and that she is eligible to apply for adjustment of status through her United States citizen spouse.
 
The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The Supplementary Information to this regulation explained that the Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but that it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500, 501 (BIA 2008); 67 Fed. Reg. At 54,888-89 (Supplementary Information).
 
The record reflects that the Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) was served personally on the respondent on October 5, 1994. The OSC was read to the respondent in English, and the OSC bears the respondent’s right thumb print and her signature to acknowledge her receipt of it. The OSC also advised the respondent of the requirement to provide the Immigration Court within five days of any change of address, and of the consequences of a failure to appear. The Miami Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing by certified mail to the respondent on February 14, 1995, but it was returned to the court as “addressee unknown.” The respondent failed to appear at the hearing on June 14, 1995, and she was ordered deported in absentia.
 
As the respondent’s deportation proceedings are governed by former section 242B of the Act, we apply the case of Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995) (Board held that a hearing notice which is sent by certified mail to the alien’s last known address is sufficient to establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien received written notice of the deportation hearing within the meaning of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act). In her affidavit dated March 20, 1998, the respondent stated that she was residing on or about September 1994 through November 1994 at 1558 N.E. 30th Street, Pompano Beach, Florida, 33064. Thereafter, she moved to 7377 N.W. 49 th Place, Lauderhill, Florida, and lived there for approximately one year before moving to a new address in Coral Springs, Florida.¿FN1º Therefore, the notice of hearing was properly sent to the respondent’s last known address in Pompano Beach, Florida, and she admitted in her affidavit that she moved from that address before the notice of hearing was sent on February 14, 1995. However, the respondent failed to file a change of address (Form EOIR-33) with the Immigration Court, as required. See OSC, at 4. It is clear that the respondent received notice pursuant to Matter of Grijalva, supra. In this case, the evidence of record reflects that the Miami Immigration Court sent the notice of hearing to the respondent’s last known address, and the envelope indicates that delivery of the notice of hearing was attempted at the respondent’s address before being returned to the court as “addressee unknown.” Furthermore, since being served with the OSC in October 1994, the respondent did not notify the Immigration Court of any change in her address until March 2008, despite being notified to do so upon receiving personal service of the Order to Show Cause.¿FN2º In light of the documentary evidence in the record that the notice of hearing was sent by certified mail through the U.S. Postal Service to the respondent’s last known address and there is proof of attempted delivery and notification of certified mail to the respondent, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received proper notice of the hearing. The respondent also admitted in her affidavit of March 20, 1998, that she moved from her prior address several months before the notice of hearing was sent to her by the court, and she did not contend that she provided the Immigration Court with her new address. Therefore, the respondent has failed to overcome the strong presumption of effective service.
 
*2 The respondent also claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel when Eric Allen and his associates failed to appear for the December 16, 1998, hearing on the first motion to reopen. She asserts that they never informed her of this hearing date. The respondent states that she believed Eric Allen was an attorney, and that unknown to her, Mr. Allen hired someone else to represent her. She claims that she did not contact the attorneys because she was unaware of them, and she attempted to file a complaint against Eric Allen, but he had already entered into a consent agreement with the Florida Bar for unlicensed practice of law. The respondent also contends that her second motion to reopen, filed by Margaret Blot, was deficient and clearly constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
As discussed by the Immigration Judge, attorney Edward J. Abramson filed the initial motion to reopen on the respondent’s behalf, and Mr. Abramson swore the respondent to her initial affidavit of March 20, 1998, and filed it with the Immigration Court on September 21, 1998. See I.J. Dec. dated February 22, 2008, at 3. Furthermore, on November 20, 1998, Samuel Blanco, Esquire, represented the respondent on record during deportation proceedings at the request of Mr. Abramson. The respondent contends that Margaret Blot, Esquire, provided ineffective assistance of counsel when she filed a deficient second motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent did not strictly comply with the requirements of Lozada with regards to the explicit allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel as it pertains to Ms. Blot, nor the implicit allegations of ineffective assistance as it pertains to either Mr. Abramson or Mr. Blanco. Id.; see also Gbaya v. United States Attorney General, 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003) (requiring strict compliance with the requirements of Lozada in cases arising under the jurisdiction of the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent failed to submit any evidence that she informed prior counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel and provided them with an opportunity to respond to such allegations, nor has she submitted any evidence that complaints were filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. The respondent also failed to include with her motion to reopen a copy of a 1999 Florida Bar Cease and Desist the Unlicensed Practice of Law Order regarding Mr. Allen, nor has the respondent submitted any evidence that she has taken any unlicensed practice of law action against Mr. Allen. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal, but has provided no persuasive explanation why such evidence was not previously available to her. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
*3 Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish that she acted with due diligence required for equitable tolling. Mr. Abramson swore the respondent to her initial affidavit of March 20, 1998, and filed it with the Immigration Court on September 21, 1998. During the proceedings on November 20, 1998, attorney Samuel Blanco appeared on behalf of the respondent’s counsel and indicated that the respondent was incapacitated and could not appear for the hearing. See I.J. Dec. dated December 17, 1998. However, the respondent did not file another motion to reopen until December 4, 2007, and she failed to indicate with any specificity what steps she had taken in the interim to determine her immigration status, either by contacting a former attorney or representative, or by contacting the Immigration Court.¿FN3º The respondent’s assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be overcome by the lack of respondent’s due diligence in pursuing her case. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (in cases where an alien moves to reopen beyond the applicable time limit, he must show that he exercised due diligence in seeking to cure his lawyer’s alleged deficient performance).
 
Finally, the respondent contends that she is prima facie eligible for the relief of adjustment of status pursuant to Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). Pursuant to Matter of Velarde, supra, a motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status may be granted, in the exercise of discretion, if 1) the motion is timely filed; 2) the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations; 3) the motion is not barred by Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), or on any other procedural ground; 4) the motion presents clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the respondent’s marriage is bona fide; and 5) the Service either does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992). We note that Matter of Velarde, supra, did not arise in the context of in absentia proceedings. Rather, the respondent sought reopening before the Board to apply for a new form of relief within 90 days of the Board’s decision dismissing his appeal. Id. at 256. As the respondent was ordered deported in absentia, we must look to in absentia case law and statutes for guidance in this matter. In a deportation case, we found that an alien is not required to rescind her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).¿FN4º Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and after September 30, 1996. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
  
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s subsequent affidavit, dated January 28, 2008, states that she resided in Pompano Beach, Florida, from October 1994 to approximately September 1995. This is in direct conflict with her affidavit of March 20, 1998, and we note that her subsequent affidavit was written and signed almost ten years after the original affidavit.

2

In his decision dated February 22, 2008, the Immigration Judge advised the respondent that she must file with the Immigration Court within 5 days a Form EOIR-33/IC, Alien Change of Address Form/Immigration Court, declaring her actual address.

3

In her affidavit dated January 28, 2008, the respondent appears to state that she last had contact with Mr. Allen some time in 2000.

Pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3), a motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lamar Peckham, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lowell C. Powell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 14, 2008, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen our October 28, 2004, decision dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 29, 2004, decision. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1245(i), based on his April 17, 2004, marriage to a United States citizen. We will grant the motion.
 
The respondent seeks to toll the filing deadline imposed on this motion based on a claim of deficient performance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (hereinafter “Matter of Compean”). The respondent argues that he suffered prejudice in these proceedings as a result of his former attorney’s failure to file a timely motion to reopen the proceedings to enable him to apply for adjustment of status based on his marriage. In support of the claim, the respondent has submitted evidence wherein his former attorney admits that he did not file a timely motion to reopen the proceedings on the respondent’s behalf due to a calendaring mistake. See Tab G. Also with the motion, the respondent has submitted evidence in support of the bona fides of the marriage, e.g., the birth certificate of a child born to the respondent and his spouse (Tab D), and a joint income tax return form (Tab J). See Matter of Velarde, 23 I. & N. Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). Based on this evidence, we find that the respondent has shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorney’s error. See Matter of Compean, supra, at 733-34.
 
We also find that the respondent has shown diligence in pursuing this matter. In this regard, we note that the respondent filed a timely petition for judicial review of our previous order, and that this motion followed within 90 days of the circuit court’s mandate. Id. at 732-33. Finally, because the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements for a deficient performance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Matter of Compean, supra, at 741-42.
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, we find that equitable tolling of the filing deadline in this case is appropriate. Upon consideration of the motion, we will reopen the proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Judge.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey Rubin, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a motion to reopen on November 17, 2008. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on April 20, 2006, so the motion was untimely filed. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion. Although the motion is untimely, we will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent was found subject to removal based on a 2-count Massachusetts conviction for larceny of property and false representation to the Department of Public Welfare to secure support. The respondent presents evidence that, on October 27, 2008, the state court judge allowed the respondent’s “Motion for New Trial”. The “Motion for New Trial” argued that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel concerning the immigration consequences of the plea.
 
The Board finds that the evidence presented establishes that the underlying convictions which served as the basis for the respondent being subject to removal have been vacated due to a defect in the criminal proceeding. If a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006)(conviction vacated pursuant to Ohio law for failure of the trial court to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes).
 
As the respondent is no longer subject to removal from the United States based upon the charges against her, removal proceedings against the respondent are terminated.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joaquin A. Talleda, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)º-Entered the United States without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from the August 20, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen the in absentia deportation order entered on October 25, 1990. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, there are no time or numeric limitations on motions to reopen an in absentia deportation order, and the in absentia order of deportation may be reopened upon a showing of “reasonable cause” for the respondent’s failure to appear at the hearing scheduled on October 25, 1990 (I.J. at 3). See Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999). On appeal the respondent renews his argument that he has established reasonable cause for his failure to appear for the hearing scheduled on October 25, 1990, based on the allegedly deficient performance of prior counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (replacing prior “ineffective assistance of counsel” reopening framework with “deficient performance of counsel” framework for adjudicating motions to reopen on this basis).¿FN1º
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established reasonable cause for his failure to appear at the hearing scheduled on October 25, 1990. The respondent concedes that he received both the original charging document, an Order to Show Cause dated May 22, 1990, and the notice for the hearing held on October 25, 1990 (I.J. at 2). However, the respondent asserts, under a theory of deficient performance of counsel, that he elected not to appear on the scheduled hearing date because a “notario,”as opposed to a licensed attorney, advised him that he would “take care” of the respondent’s obligation to appear at the hearing (I.J. at 2). In addition, the respondent contends that a subsequent licensed attorney performed deficiently on his behalf in connection with a prior motion to reopen filed on November 8, 1990 (I.J. at 2). We have recognized in the past that the deficient performance of counsel can constitute reasonable cause for failing to appear at a scheduled hearing. See Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). However, as a matter of settled law, neither of the respondent’s claimed examples of deficient performance justifies reopening this case.
 
First, inasmuch as the respondent does not claim that the notario upon whom he relied represented himself as otherwise, there can be no deficient performance of counsel without counsel. See Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014, 1018-20 (9th Cir. 2008); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, supra. (“The deficient performance of counsel claim extends only to the conduct of a lawyer, an accredited representative, or a non-lawyer that the alien reasonably but erroneously believed to be a lawyer who was retained to represent the alien in the proceedings.”). Second, as recognized by the Immigration Judge, the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirement announced in Matter of Lozada, supra, in connection with his allegation of deficient performance against the prior attorney in that he elected not to file a complaint against the attorney with the proper disciplinary authorities (I.J. at 2-3). Instead, the respondent attempted to explain why no such complaint was filed against the attorney in the motion to reopen, claiming that he wished to spare the attorney in question embarrassment (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s MTR at 6 (July 2, 2007)).
 
*2 We are mindful that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has provided for a limited number of circumstances under which it will not respect our strict adherence to the procedural prerequisites for a motion to reopen or reconsider under a theory of deficient performance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2008) (“¿Iºn cases where a petitioner’s attorney has been suspended after failing to respond to prior charges of ineffective assistance, it would be futile for the petitioner to inform counsel of the accusations or file a complaint, and Morales’s failure to do so therefore does not bar her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003) (excusing alien’s failure to lodge a complaint with the appropriate state disciplinary authorities where alien offered a reasonable excuse for this omission and there was no suggestion of collusion between the alien and former counsel); Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 82 (9th Cir. 2003) (relaxing requirement that the alien file a bar complaint against prior counsel where other evidence before the court of appeals ¿but not before the Boardº showed that “former counsel regarded his delinquency as a serious breach of services promised to his client.”); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002) (dispensing with the Lozada requirements where counsel’s ineffective assistance was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record); Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, 213 F.3d 1121, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2000) (concluding that “arbitrary application” of the Lozada requirement is not warranted if alien shows “diligent efforts” to comply were unsuccessful due to factors beyond his control); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir.2000) (observing that the record served the Lozada functions because it was undisputed that counsel failed to file suspension of deportation application). However, merely wishing to spare the prior attorney’s feelings is not an appropriate reason for which to relax this requirement, and the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on this basis alone. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 526 (“Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.”). Furthermore, even had the respondent complied with all of Matter of Lozada’s procedural requirements, the respondent’s motion to reopen, insofar as it is premised on the alleged mistakes of the prior attorney and not those of the notario, still would have failed to establish reasonable cause for the respondent’s failure to appear at the hearing held on October 25, 1990, because the prior attorney did not even enter her appearance on the respondent’s behalf until after the entry of the in absentia deportation order on November 8, 1990, and there is no evidence in the record of proceeding to establish the existence of an attorney-client relationship prior to this date (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s MTR, Exh. C (July 2, 2007)). Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

As indicated by the Attorney General, the substantive standards set forth in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, supra, apply to all pending motions to reopen based on a lawyer’s allegedly deficient performance regardless of when such motions were filed and, thus, apply here. Id. at 741. However, the new procedural requirements applicable to deficient performance of counsel claims are only applicable to motions to reopen filed after January 7, 2009. Id. at 741-42. Accordingly, we, like the Immigration Judge below, have applied the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims announced in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Vargas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William C. Padish
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 28, 2008, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen based on a change in law following his removal to Mexico. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23 (b)(1), she lacked jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed more than 6 years after the respondent was removed from the United States.
 
After the Immigration Judge entered the order in this case, this Board decided Matter of Armandarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008). There, this Board concluded that it lacked authority to reopen removal proceedings, whether on motion of an alien or sua sponte, if the alien had departed the United States after proceedings were completed. The Board observed that the regulation that restricted our jurisdiction, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), contained essentially identical language as the regulation governing the filing of motions in Immigration Court, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Thus, the Immigration Judge had no jurisdiction to reopen the respondent’s case either on motion by the respondent or sua sponte.
 
Even assuming there were an exception based on a claim of a “gross miscarriage of justice,” the respondent failed to establish such a gross miscarriage of justice in his removal given that the respondent’s admission to removability, on the advice of his attorney, was consistent with the law applicable at the time of his hearing and at the time of his removal. See Robledo-Gonzales v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 667 (7th Cir. 2003) (observing that in collateral attack on prior deportation, Board had found gross miscarriage of justice only when the alien should not have been deported based on the law as it existed at the time of the original deportation).
 
Thus, we find no merit to the respondent’s arguments on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to fully consider his ineffective assistance of counsel and equitable tolling claims, including that his former counsel should have argued for a change in law and should have informed his mother, when she inquired, that the law applicable to his case changed shortly after his removal. These issues were not relevant to the decision on the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eduardo Soto, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on October 3, 2008, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 5, 2006, decision to deny his application for adjustment of status under section 202 of the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), Title II of Pub. L. No. 105-111 Stat. 2193 (1997). The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings on January 2, 2009. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he needed a section 212(i) waiver inasmuch as the respondent now states that he did not commit fraud. The respondent further argues, in a cursory fashion, that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing. Regarding this latter matter, the respondent has utterly failed to comply with the guidelines set forth in See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also.Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (setting forth evidentiary standards for deficient counsel claims that are not implicated here because they only apply to a motion to reopen filed after January 7, 2009).
 
Regarding the respondent’s eligibility for NACARA, we found, in our October 3, 2008, final administrative order, that the respondent failed to present “the requisite evidence to establish the commencement of his physical presence in the United States” (Bd. Dec. at 1). In his motion, the respondent does not address this issue, which served as the basis for our dismissal of his appeal. The respondent’s arguments regarding the validity of his birth certificate and his lack of willfullness in any fraudulent behavior does not alter our finding that the respondent failed to demonstrate eligibility for NACARA benefits. While the respondent now argues that his former counsel failed to submit affidavits in support of his physical presence, we note that the respondent has not only failed to submit evidence of former counsel’s ineffectiveness, but he has also failed to submit any affidavits with his current motion. Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb our prior decision, and the motion will be denied. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sin Yen Ling, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Vietnam, was granted lawful permanent residence in 1991. On or about September 8, 1997, the respondent was convicted of kidnaping, a felony, in violation of section 207(a) of the California Penal Code; of assault with a deadly weapon not a firearm, a felony, in violation section 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code; and battery against a noncohabitant, a misdemeanor, in violation of sections 242 and 243(e) of the California Penal Code. (I.J. Dec. At Exh. 1; Exh. 9). The respondent was sentenced to 2 years in prison. (Exh. 9). The state court suspended the imposition of his sentence and granted him, 3 years of probation, the first 270 days of which apparently was to be served in the county jail (Exh. 9).
 
At some point the respondent traveled outside the United States, and on or about June 20, 2005, when the respondent sought admission to the United States, he was paroled into the United States. On February 14, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C § 1229b(a). On May 23, 2008, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal.
 
On August 6, 2008, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. The respondent contends that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U. S.C. § 1182(h), and that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to seek such a waiver. He also argues that the Immigration Judge erred by failing to determine whether a section 212(h) waiver was available. The respondent’s former counsel responded to the state bar complaint, asserting that it was the understanding of his law firm that such relief was not available to the respondent.
 
On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision announcing a new standard for claims involving what was formerly known as) ineffective assistance of counsel. In Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General announced several new substantive standards for evaluating such claims, now known as “deficient performance of counsel” claims, that apply regardless of whenever a motion to reopen that raises such claims has been filed, as well as new evidentiary standards that are not implicated here because they only apply to a motion to reopen filed after January 7, 2009. See 24 I&N Dec. at 741. Consistent with that decision, we will designate the respondent’s claims as “deficient performance of counsel” claims throughout the remainder of this order and analyze those claims in a manner that is consistent with the holdings in that decision. See id. at 730 n.8 and 741.
 
*2 To demonstrate deficient performance of counsel, the respondent must show, inter alia, prejudice. Prejudice requires a showing that but for the deficient performance, it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking. Id. at 734-35. Here, the respondent has not shown that it is more likely than not that his removal would result in extreme hardship to his United States citizen parents within the meaning of section 212(h). Further, contrary to what former counsel argued, it appears that two of the respondent’s convictions were aggravated felonies for immigration purposes, see section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F), so the respondent was not eligible for a waiver under section 212(h).¿FN1º
 
Accordingly, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the proceeding should be reopened under Matter of Compean or that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to advise the respondent that he may be eligible for the section 212(h) waiver. As such, the motion shall be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

A conviction under California Penal Code § 207(a) is a crime of violence. See 18 U.S.C. § 16(b). See United States v. Lonczak, 993 F.2d 180, 182-83 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Sherbondy, 865 F.2d 996, 1009 (9th Cir. 1988) (finding kidnaping poses a serious potential risk of physical injury and is a violent felony). Similarly, a conviction for “¿aºssault with a deadly weapon under California Penal Cod § 245(a)(1) is a crime of violence as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 16…” Ortiz-Magana v. Mukasey, 542 F.3d 653, 654 (9th Cir. 2008). Although the respondent was convicted under “wobbler” statutes, see sections 208 and 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code, he was sentenced to 2 years in prison, and imposition of his sentence was suspended. United States v. Robinson, 967 F.2d 287, 293 (9th Cir. 1992) (because the state court suspended imposition of sentence, it did not render a judgment of conviction within the meaning of California Penal Code section 17(b)(1)). The record does not indicate, moreover, that the state court took any subsequent action to designate the offense a misdemeanor. Cal. Penal Code § 17(b)(3); Robinson, 967 F.2d at 293. The convictions carried a maximum penalty of between 3-8 years in state prison for the kidnapping, § 208(a) of the California Penal Code, and between 2-4 years for the assault with a deadly weapon, § 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Don W. Pak, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 12, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s August 21, 2001, decision denying the respondent’s motion to continue to afford the former Immigration and Naturalization Service the opportunity to adjudicate an immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) filed on the respondent’s behalf.
 
On December 15, 2008, the respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, filed a motion to reopen these proceedings based, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
Subsequent to the filing of this motion the Attorney General issued Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (overruling in part Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003)). An ineffective assistance of counsel claim, now referred to as a “deficient performance of counsel” claim, may be asserted by a respondent where his prior attorney’s deficient performance likely changed the outcome of the removal proceeding. To prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim, the respondent must establish that his lawyer’s failings were egregious and that his case was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. In cases such as this one, where the respondent moves to reopen beyond the statutory 90-day time limit, we may toll the filing period only if the respondent shows that he exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to cure the alleged deficient performance.
 
The respondent alleges that because his former counsel, Mr. Andrew Gay, failed to file his immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) on or before April 30, 2001, he is ineligible for adjustment of status under former section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). When the respondent realized that Mr. Gay failed to file the I-130, he took corrective action right away. By November 2001, the respondent had hired a second attorney, Mr. Josh J.T. Byrne, to file the I-130. See Respondent’s Motion, Respondent’s Affidavit. The record reveals that Mr. Gay represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge and Mr. Byrne represented him before this Board.
 
*2 The respondent asserts that he did not discover Mr. Gay’s ineffectiveness until he consulted with current counsel in November 2008. However, this is inconsistent with the respondent’s motion and his own statement. The respondent explains that he knew in 2001 that Mr. Gay’s actions had rendered him ineligible for adjustment of status under former section 245(i) of the Act. While Mr. Byrne apparently properly re-filed the I-130, it was not filed by April 30, 2001, so as to qualify the respondent for 245(i) adjustment. Despite the passage of time, nothing has changed regarding the respondent’s ineligibility for 245(i) treatment.
 
We will deny the respondent’s motion. The respondent failed to show that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his case. Even if the respondent had exercised due diligence, we have no authority to toll the deadline imposed by section 245(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. The statute contains a fixed cut-off date for eligibility, and it is independent of any variable. Therefore, we cannot toll the April 30, 2001, statutory deadline for 245(i) adjustment eligibility based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1047-50 (9th Cir. 2008) (affirming this Board’s finding that the deadline imposed under section 245(i) operates as a statute of repose, and so is not subject to equitable tolling). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied as untimely filed.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Guadagno, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 20, 2008, when, on remand from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, we granted the respondent’s motion to reconsider our October 18, 2007, decision denying his September 21, 2007, motion to reopen. We further vacated the portion of the October 18, 2007, decision denying the motion to reopen as untimely. Still extant are the remaining sections of the decision, including the determination to deny the motion because the respondent’s claim that ineffective of assistance of counsel¿FN1º was the “reasonable cause” of his delayed appearance at his deportation hearing, was not presented in accordance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent again moves to reopen the proceedings to vacate his deportation order and seek relief. He submits a brief, a copy of a complaint against his original counsel filed with a disciplinary committee, and an affidavit by present counsel, attesting that these documents were prepared to submit to the Board in conjunction with the Second Circuit remand, but since the Board never issued a briefing schedule, he was prevented from timely submitting the documents before the Board issued its October 20, 2008, decision¿FN2º. The respondent asserts that with the previous submission of the respondent’s affidavit and the affirmation from former counsel attesting that he caused the respondent’s delay in arriving for his deportation hearing, now he has fully satisfied the Matter of Lozada requirements and has shown reasonable cause for his failure to appear at his deportation hearing.
 
As the respondent was ordered deported under former section 242(b) of the Act, his motion to reopen is not subject to the time and number limitations provided under section 240(c)(7) of the Act and 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c)(2). Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155, 1158 (BIA 1999).
 
Upon consideration, we find that the respondent has established that he was 55 minutes late for his deportation hearing because of his former counsel’s instructions, and that such deficient performance caused him to fail to appear. The respondent has further demonstrated prejudice. Therefore, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The in absentia order of deportation entered May 8, 1991, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this order.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David E. Piver, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On January 21, 2009, the respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, filed a motion to reopen these proceedings based, in part, on a claim that her prior attorney’s performance was deficient. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our decision.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) (an alien may file one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions not relevant here, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). This is the respondent’s fourth motion to reopen. A final administrative order was issued in this case on February 25, 2003, when the Immigration Judge granted the respondent the privilege of voluntary departing the United States and entered an alternate order of removal in the event that the respondent failed to depart as promised.
 
The respondent acknowledges that her motion is untimely, but asks that the 90-day motions deadline be tolled based on her deficient performance of counsel claim against her former attorney Mr. Saint-Preux. Pursuant to the Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (overruling in part Matter of Lozada and Matter of Assaad), in order to prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim, the respondent must show that (1) her lawyer’s failings were egregious; (2) she exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to cure the alleged deficient performance when the motion is untimely filed; and (3) her case was prejudiced by her lawyer’s errors. In our prior decision, we concluded that the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Mr. Saint-Preux, was without factual and legal merit. We also concluded that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing her case. We will not revisit the issue. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied as time and number barred.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
June Y.I. Ito
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China. He was personally served with the Notice to Appear on June 11, 1998, and the Notice of Hearing was mailed to his former counsel, Benjamin Chen. The record also contain the respondent’s affidavit dated December 8, 1998. Therein, the respondent acknowledged that he had a hearing scheduled on December 15, 1998, in Hawaii. He further indicated that he had moved to New York, and he requested that venue be changed to New York. The motion to change venue was not adjudicated, and the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on December 15, 1998, after failing to appear for his hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on February 23, 1999. The Immigration Judge denied it on March 22, 1999. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on April 10, 2008. That motion was denied on May 1, 2008, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent does not deny on appeal that he was notified of his hearing. He has therefore not established that lack of notice caused his failure to appear for the hearing. The respondent’s request for reopening to the extent that it argues that ineffective assistance of counsel may have caused his failure to appear is untimely. A request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Because the respondent’s second request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration. The respondent has also not established that it is appropriate to equitably toll either the time or number bars to reopening. The respondent has failed to satisfy any of the procedural requirements for proving that he was the victim of attorney negligence. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561 -62 (BIA 2003). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Manfred Rosenow, Esquire
*1 The pending motion, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be granted, and the records remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
The respondents are a married couple from Peru, ages 64 and 66. An Immigration Judge issued an order of removal on March 30, 2007. The respondents’ requests for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1245, based on an approved immediate relative visa petition filed by their adult daughter, were deemed abandoned. Current counsel, Manfred Rosenow, filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied on May 23, 2007. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondents failed to show good cause for their failure to provide biometric information under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(c) (failure to comply with the requirements to provide biometrics and other biographical information within the time allowed by the Immigration Judge’s order constitutes abandonment of the application for relief from removal).
 
The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying reopening on September 4, 2008. The Board found that, on appeal, Rosenow failed to meet the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against himself, and did not present evidence that the respondents had then complied with the biometric requirement.
 
The respondents, on October 31, 2008, filed a motion seeking to withdraw their grant of voluntary departure. The Board granted the request on January 21, 2009, citing Dada v. Mukasey, __U.S.__, 123 S.Ct. 2307 (2008). The Board denied a requested stay of removal, noting that the respondents had not filed a motion seeking adjustment of status, and no motion to reopen was pending with the Board.
 
The respondents filed a motion to reopen on January 22, 2009, and the Board granted a stay of removal on February 4, 2009. The pending motion was filed late. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The motion, citing Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (Matter of Compean), argues that the Board should grant reopening based on the admitted deficient performance of current counsel Rosenow. The acknowledged deficient performance occurred, the motion states, when Rosenow’s law office failed to timely furnish the biometrics and biographical information to the Immigration Court, concerning the respondents’ adjustment applications (Respondents’ Mot., at p. 1).
 
*2 The United States Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compean first found that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. Id. at 716-727. As to whether reopening is appropriate under the Board’s “broad discretion”, Matter of Compean, supra, at 728, the Attorney General set forth a “general framework” that the Board is to apply. Id. at 730. The Attorney General announced several substantive standards for evaluating such claims, now known as “deficient performance of counsel” claims, as well as evidentiary standards for such claims. Id. at 730-39.¿FN1º
 
As for substantive standards, under Matter of Compean, supra, at 732, a respondent must first show that counsel’s failings were “egregious”.¿FN2º The motion concedes, and the Board agrees, that counsel’s failure to supply the biometric information to the Immigration Court was “egregious”, Respondents’ Mot., at p. 4. Next, under Matter of Compean, supra, at 732-33, a party filing an untimely motion must show that he acted with diligence. The Attorney General stated that “¿tºhe determination of whether the facts and circumstances warrant tolling of the filing period is—like the decision on a motion to reopen based on counsel’s allegedly deficient performance itself— committed in all instances to the discretion of the Board”. Matter of Compean, supra, at 733. In this case, particularly as the respondents remain represented by counsel who admits his shortcomings in their case, the untimeliness of the motion will be excused.
 
Finally, under Matter of Compean, supra, at 733-35, an “alien must establish prejudice arising from the lawyer’s errors”, that is, an “alien must show that but for the deficient performance, it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking.” The Board finds that this standard is met here, where the Immigration Judge found that the respondents had abandoned their claim to relief based on counsel’s admitted failure to supply the biometric information. See also Respondents’ Mot., at p. 5 (conceding that attorney’s actions prejudiced their case).
 
As for procedural requirements, under Matter of Compean, supra, at 735, the motion “must submit a detailed affidavit setting forth the facts that form the basis of the deficient performance of counsel claim”. The motion presents affidavits from the respondents’ daughter, as well as counsel Rosenow (Respondents’ Mot., at Exhs. C, D). Next, Matter of Compean, supra, at 736, requires that “the alien must attach a copy of his agreement, if any, with the lawyer whose performance he alleges was deficient. Where there was no written agreement, the alien must specify in his affidavit what the lawyer had agreed to do, including whether it included the particular step in the proceedings in which the deficient performance is alleged to have occurred”. The motion explains that the agreement was verbal, and the daughter’s affidavit explains the agreement (Respondents’ Mot., at p. 6; Exh. C).
 
*3 Next, Matter of Compean, supra, at 736, requires that “the alien must attach both a copy of a letter to his former counsel setting forth the lawyer’s deficient performance and a copy of the lawyer’s response, if any.” (emphasis in original). This requirement is met here by the affidavits of the respondents’ daughter, and counsel Rosenow (Respondents’ Mot. at p. 6; Exhs. C, D). The decision in Matter of Compean, supra, at 737-38, then requires that “the alien must attach a completed and signed complaint addressed to the appropriate State bar or disciplinary authorities.” The motion contains such evidence (Respondents’ Mot. at p. 6; Exh. E). Matter of Compean, supra, at 738, then states that “if the alien’s claim is that his former lawyer failed to submit something to the immigration judge or to the Board, he must attach the allegedly omitted item to his motion.” The motion presents a receipt for the biometrics taken on May 23, 2007, that were not submitted to the Immigration Judge, and acknowledges that the biometrics have likely expired (Respondents’ Mot., at p. 6; Exh. F). Finally, Matter of Compean, supra, at 738-39, requires a statement from counsel filing the motion acknowledging that complained-of counsel’s actions “fell below minimal standards of professional competence.” This is readily acknowledged by counsel (Respondents’ Mot., at p. 6; Exh D).
 
As the motion complies with the requirements of Matter of Compean for making a claim of deficient performance of counsel, the motion to reopen will be granted.
 
ORDER: The records are remanded to the Immigration Court in order to afford the respondents an opportunity to present their applications for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on July 22, 2005, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). On August 20, 2007, the respondent, a native and citizen of Senegal, filed an untimely motion to reopen these proceedings to afford her the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status based on her approved immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) filed by her United States citizen husband.
 
The motion will be denied because it was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). However, because the respondent’s motion is based, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel we will consider whether the 90-day time limit should be equitably tolled.
 
Subsequent to the filing of this motion the Attorney General issued Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (overruling in part Matter ofLozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003)). This type of claim, now referred to as a “deficient performance of counsel” claim, may be asserted by a respondent where her prior attorney’s deficient performance likely changed the outcome of the removal proceeding. To prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim, the respondent must establish that her lawyer’s failings were egregious and that her case was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. In cases such as this one, where the respondent moves to reopen beyond the statutory 90-day time limit, we may toll the filing period only if the respondent shows that she exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to cure the alleged deficient performance.
 
In this case, the respondent failed to establish that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her case. According to Mr. Ronald S. Salomon, he immediately informed the respondent of our July 22, 2005, decision. See Respondent’s January 2, 2008, filing, Mr. Salomon’s November 5, 2007, letter to the New York Departmental Disciplinary Committee. The respondent acknowledges that she was advised that her appeal had been dismissed by the Board. The respondent did not file the instant motion to reopen until August 20, 2007, She does not meaningfully explain the two-year delay in filing the motion. Accordingly, we do not find that the respondent has adequately established that tolling is warranted in this case.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has failed to establish that Mr. Salomon’s failings were egregious. In part, she blames Mr. Salomon for her failure to appear for her September 8, 2003, removal hearing and for his failure to file an appeal brief resulting in the summary dismissal of her appeal. Mr. Salomon challenges these accusations leveled against him. Mr. Salomon explains that the in absentia order was rescinded, which in fact is supported by the record. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that the outcome of her appeal was affected by counsel’s performance. And, the basis on which she presently seeks reopening, her marriage and the ultimately approved visa petition, occurred after her relationship with counsel had terminated. Finally, we note that the respondent’s marriage occurred after the period had elapsed in which she could have timely filed a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXXX XX8 909 - Eloy, AZ

IN BOND PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Erica L. Seger
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Change in custody status
 
*1 The respondent appealed from an Immigration Judge’s October 1, 2008, bond order, which denied his request for a change of custody status and ordered that he remain held without bond under section 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In finding that bond was not warranted under section 236(a) of the Act, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent poses both a danger to the community and a substantial risk of flight from proceedings to remove him from the United States. The reasons for the Immigration Judge’s decision are set forth in an accompanying bond memorandum, which is dated October 28, 2008.
 
Initially, we observe that the respondent, who has a petition for review pending with the Ninth Circuit, has received a custody hearing before an Immigration Judge consistent with Prieto-Romero v. Clark, 534 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2008), and Casas-Castrillon v. DHS, 535 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2008).¿FN1º Thus, the record establishes that the Immigration Judge provided him with a hearing at which the Immigration Judge made an individualized assessment of his dangerousness and flight risk. The discretion of an Immigration Judge with respect to granting bail in a removal case can be overridden only where it is clearly shown that the exercise of discretion was without a reasonable foundation. See Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524 (1952). The respondent’s appellate arguments fail to persuade this Board that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he is a danger and a flight risk.
 
In this matter, we find that the Immigration Judge acted reasonably in relying on appropriate factors, in finding that the respondent presents a danger and a substantial flight risk. See Matter of Guerra, 24 I&N Dec. 37 (BIA 2006). The Immigration Judge discussed the respondent’s criminal background, which includes multiple New York convictions, two convictions for the crimes of criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree and two convictions for criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree. The Immigration Judge commented that drug trafficking activities and related crimes represent a serious danger to society. The respondent’s convictions for selling marijuana clearly are for drug trafficking offenses. The Immigration Judge also discussed the Board’s February 14, 2008, affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s removal order. In our February 2008 order, we noted that, although the Immigration Judge advised the respondent that he was eligible to apply for withholding of removal under the Act and for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), the respondent’s counsel indicated that the respondent would not seek withholding of removal or CAT because he was ineligible for such relief.¿FN2º
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent references Tijani v. Willis, 430 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2005). See Br. at 1 et seq. To the extent that the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge should have held the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to its burden of proving ineligibility for bond by clear and convincing evidence, see Br. at 4-10, we observe that, to the contrary, the Ninth Circuit’s decisions do not stand for the proposition that the DHS has the burden of establishing a respondent’s ineligibility for bond by clear and convincing evidence. Cf. Casas-Castrillon v. INS, supra, at 951, quoting Tijani v. Willis, supra, at 1242 (stating that “an Immigration Judge ¿hasº the power to grant ¿a respondentº bail unless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or will be a danger to the community”). Moreover, when in Prieto-Romero v. Clark, supra, an alien argued that Tijani v. Willis, supra, requires all aliens to receive bond hearings where the government bears the burden of establishing ineligibility for release, the Ninth Circuit held that it need not resolve the issue because Mr. Prieto-Romero could not demonstrate prejudice, see 534 F.3d at 1066, and we reach that same conclusion with regard to this respondent.
 
In this case, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is a danger and a flight risk. As a danger and a flight risk, the respondent has no constitutional right to be at liberty in the United States while he challenges his removal order before the Ninth Circuit. See Carlson v. London, supra. The Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s request for release from custody is affirmed, pursuant to this Board’s authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We observe that we would view this bond appeal as moot because the respondent is subject to an administratively final removal order, but for the holdings of the Ninth Circuit in Prieto-Romero v. Clark, supra, and Casas-Castrillon v. DHS, supra. We note that the Board dismissed the respondent’s removal appeal on February 14, 2008, and denied his motion to reopen on December 23, 2008.

On December 23, 2008, subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s bond decision, this Board denied the respondent’s motion to reopen alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Peter N. Schmalz
Associate Counsel
*1 APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
The petitioner has filed an appeal of the September 28, 2007, decision of the Field Office Director (“Director”). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The petitioner filed a visa petition on behalf of the beneficiary, a native and citizen of Colombia, as the spouse of a United States citizen. The record indicates that the petitioner and the beneficiary were married on July 25, 2003.¿FN1º The Director observed that the beneficiary failed to disclose that she was previously married. Moreover, the Director concluded that the record reveals that her previous marriage was not legally terminated until November 15, 2007. The beneficiary argues that she was unaware that her previous marriage was not lawfully terminated, claiming that the failure to complete the process resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel. Following the termination of her previous marriage, the petitioner and the beneficiary remarried on December 10, 2007. However, the visa petition must be approvable at the time it is filed. As the petitioner and the beneficiary were not legally married for immigration purposes at the time the visa petition was filed, the appeal must be dismissed.
 
The petitioner may, of course, file a new visa petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975); 8 C.F.R. § 1204.2(a)(1)(B).

This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The relief of voluntary departure requires both a showing that the respondent is statutorily eligible and that it is merited as a matter of administrative discretion. See Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999); Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972). An alien may apply for voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act either in lieu of being subject to removal proceedings or before the conclusion of those proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b); Matter of Arguelles-Campos, supra. Alternatively, an alien may apply for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) at the conclusion of proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c); Matter of Arguelles-Campos, supra.
 
Pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a respondent may be granted voluntary departure at his own expense before the conclusion of proceedings if he is not removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) or section 237(a)(4)(B). See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(E). The request must be made prior to or at the master calendar hearing at which the case is initially calendared for a merits hearing. The respondent must concede removability, must make no additional requests for relief (or if such requests have been made, such requests are withdrawn prior to any grant of voluntary departure. In addition, the respondent must waive appeal of all issues. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i); Matter of Arguelles-Campos, supra. The alien may be required to post a voluntary departure bond, to be surrendered on proof that the alien has departed the United States within the time specified. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(3).
 
*2 Though he found the respondent to be statutorily eligible for voluntary departure, the Immigration Judge denied relief as a matter of discretion. The Immigration Judge cited the fact that the visa petition (Form I-130) that was filed on the respondent’s behalf by his United States citizen wife was denied and not appealed. The Immigration Judge noted that the District Director had concluded that the marriage was a fraudulent one based on the inconsistent answers given at an interview.
 
However, though the Immigration Judge noted this adverse factor, he did not address the positive factors and balance the equities against the adverse factors in the summary decision as required. See Matter of Thomas, 21 I&N Dec. 20 (BIA 1995). The Immigration Judge must weigh many factors when considering a grant of voluntary departure. Adverse factors include the nature and underlying circumstances of the deportation ground at issue, additional violations of the immigration laws; the existence, seriousness, and recency of any criminal record; and other evidence of bad character or the undesirability of the alien as a permanent resident. Positive factors include long residence in the United States, close family ties in the United States, and humanitarian needs. See Matter of Arguelles-Campos, supra, at 817. See also Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244, 248 (BIA 1972). Consequently, we will remand the record to the Immigration Court to enable the Immigration Judge to do so.¿FN2º
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Immigration Judge is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.

On appeal, the respondent also alleges that he has received deficient performance of counsel. However, the respondent has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).

While the respondent remand for adjustment of status based on a refiled visa petition, the respondent failed to submit evidence of the marital bona fides with the motion. Consequently, we do not find that remand is merited on that basis under Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). However, this does not preclude the Immigration Judge from considering the matter on remand if appropriate evidence of the marital bona fides is presented.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dominick S. Cardinale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The pending motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on July 22, 2002. Through his former counsel, Satish K. Goli, the respondent moved to reopen the Immigration Judge’s order, and on August 16, 2002, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen. In that decision, the Immigration Judge noted that although the respondent claimed that his failure to appear was due to reliance on an attorney’s faulty advice, the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements for making such a claim. The respondent, through Attorney Goli, appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen, and on July 31, 2003, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent then filed a motion to reopen, raising a claim that prior counsel was inadequate, and the Board denied the motion as untimely, and procedurally deficient, on June 24, 2008. The respondent filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied by the Board on September 29, 2008.
 
The respondent submitted another motion on October 17, 2008. It was rejected as lacking the required fee, and was filed on October 30, 2008.
 
The pending motion, which is almost identical to the motion denied by the Board on September 29, 2008, asks the Board to “reconsider” its September 29, 2008, decision, but also gives a claimed “basis for motion to reopen” in bold print.
 
The motion, while failing to discuss or refute the Board’s analysis in its September 29, 2008, decision, can be read as seeking reconsideration of that order. Yet to the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration of the Board’s September 29, 2008, decision, the regulation states that “¿aº party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2); DHS Opp.
 
To the extent that the motion may be characterized as a motion to reopen, it was untimely filed, and is numerically barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2).
 
In addition to being barred by law and regulation, the respondent fails to address the Board’s conclusion, in its September 29, 2008, decision, that the respondent failed to show prejudice resulting from the actions of complained-of counsel, Goli. Rather, the respondent’s affidavit “…fails to set forth in detail the alleged misrepresentations on the part of Attorney Goli. Specifically, the motion fails to identify any errors with regard to Attorney Goli’s handling of either the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge or the appeal before the Board. Furthermore, ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Attorney Goli is not apparent on the face of the administrative record.” (Board’s Sept. 29, 2008, dec, at p. 2). The Board noted, in its September 29, 2008, decision, that the respondent failed to document a claim against the attorney whose allegedly faulty advice resulted in the respondent’s failure to appear at the removal hearing, and has not even identified that attorney by name. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710, 733-35 (A.G. 2009) (Matter of Compean) (to prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim, an alien must demonstrate that, but for the deficient performance of counsel, it is more likely than not that he would have prevailed in his quest to remain in the United States). The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The pending motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Theodore N. Cox, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Atara Eig
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This proceeding is currently before the Board on remand for the second time from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Since the Eleventh Circuit vacated our November 16, 2007, decision, we will again outline the extensive history underlying this proceeding. The respondent is a native and citizen of China who claimed persecution on account of China’s coercive population control measures. She claimed that during the course of a relationship with her boyfriend in China, she became pregnant, was arrested by family planning officials, taken to a hospital and forced to have an abortion. She also claimed that her boyfriend was arrested and fined. The respondent claimed that when told to appear for the insertion of an IUD, she became afraid, went into hiding, and eventually traveled to the United States.
 
The respondent was placed in proceedings, and received proper notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. However, the respondent did not appear at the scheduled hearing. She had filed a motion to change venue, which was not decided before the hearing, and since she did not make the appropriate travel arrangements, did not appear.¿FN1º On January 14, 2000, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent, a native and citizen of China, removed in absentia. Thereafter, the Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider. On April 25, 2001, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal, agreeing with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s excuse for failing to appear-that she was awaiting a ruling on her motion to change venue-did not rise to the level of exceptional circumstances as that term was defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
Over 4 years later, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board. She argued that proceedings should be reopened for a number of reasons, including ineffective assistance of former counsel, changed country conditions, and her right to file a successive asylum application independent of statutory or regulatory restrictions set forth in the Act and regulations. We denied the motion to reopen on September 29, 2005, and the respondent filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
 
While the petition for review was pending, the Government filed an unopposed motion to remand, requesting that the Board “consider the relationship between Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) §§ 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(2)(D), and § 240(c)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C)(ii) ¿º”, now section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), “and the additional evidence filed by petitioner with her motion to reopen.” On March 10, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit granted the motion to remand, vacated our September 29, 2005, decision, and remanded the proceeding. On remand, the parties were provided the opportunity to file additional briefs, and the respondent has availed herself of that opportunity.
 
*2 In a decision issued November 16, 2007, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. We found that the respondent did not demonstrate changed country conditions or circumstances in China that are material to her claim. See Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007); Matter of J-H-S-, 24 I&N Dec. 196 (BIA 2007); Matter of J-W-S-, 24 I&N Dec. 185 (BIA 2007); Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec. 899 (BIA 2006). We further found that the respondent had not demonstrated that she will be sterilized or otherwise subjected to coercive population control measures due to the birth of her United States citizen children. See Matter of J-W-S-, supra. As such, we found that the evidence presented by the respondent did not reflect a material “change” such that the time limitation did not apply to the present motion. We also denied the respondent’s argument that she was entitled to file a successive asylum application, see Matter of C-W-L-, 24 I&N Dec. 346 (BIA 2007), as well as her claim that the proceeding should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We found that the respondent’s claim to due process violations had no merit and declined to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen.
 
The respondent filed a timely petition for review. In a decision issued on September 11, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit found that we abused our discretion in denying reopening since the respondent preferred sufficient evidence of changed country conditions in China, similar to the evidence as that in Li v. U.S. Attorney General, 488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir. 2007), which held that the Board abused its discretion in denying a motion to reopen as the petition had established changed country conditions in the form of more aggressive enforcement of China’s family planning law. Yuan v. U.S. Attorney General, No. 07-15781, 2008 WL 4164824 (11th Cir. 2008). The Eleventh Circuit expressed concern that the Board did not rely on Li, which it had published several months before our decision was issued.¿FN2º Accordingly, the Eleventh Circuit vacated our decision and remanded the record.
 
During the pendency of the petition for review with the Eleventh Circuit, the respondent filed another motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security filed an opposition. The respondent’s current motion to reopen focuses primarily on the argument that she is entitled to file a successive asylum application at any time. However, section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act does not provide an independent basis for filing a late motion to reopen to apply for asylum without the showing of changed country conditions required by section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act. See Matter of C-W-L-, supra. Such a reading would render section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) superfluous in violation of the rule that courts must give effect to every clause and word of a statute, if possible. Matter of C-W-L-, supra, at 351, citing Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000). The more specific provision at section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act, addressing late motions to reopen to reapply for asylum, makes clear that the requirements of section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act must be met in order to apply for asylum in conjunction with an untimely motion to reopen. See Matter of C-W-L-, supra.
 
*3 However, in light of the Eleventh Circuit’s decision, which was issued subsequent to the filing of the respondent’s current motion and the DHS’s opposition, we will grant the motion to reopen based on changed country conditions and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings, including consideration of the respondent’s claims of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

Footnotes

1

The respondent submitted an affidavit, signed under penalty of perjury, to this effect. Over 4 years later, in her motion to reopen before the Board, the respondent specifically disavowed her previously filed affidavit, claiming that she just said what her former lawyer told her to say, that she did not learn about the denial of the motion to change venue until she personally received the order, and that she then brought it to her former attorney’s attention. This change in her story is inconsistent, however, with the notice of mailing, which indicated that orders were mailed to the respondent’s former attorney, not the respondent.

2

We note that the respondent never relied on Li, supra, while the first remand was pending before the Board and at no time submitted an additional motion or brief arguing that the facts of Li were the same or similar as the facts in the instant case. Further, the respondent did not file a motion to reconsider relying on Li once our decision was issued.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Morocco, was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on October 23, 2007, because the respondent failed to appear that day for his first scheduled removal hearing in Detroit, Michigan. On September 5, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, arguing that he never received either the hearing notice or the Notice to Appear. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on October 2, 2008, noting that the respondent had failed to keep the government up-to-date through numerous address changes.¿FN1º The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.
 
The respondent first entered the United States in October 1997 after being married in Morocco in July 1997 to a United States citizen (Exh. 3). That marriage was annulled in February 1998. Id. The respondent’s petition to remove the conditions on his permanent residency was denied on January 30, 2007, retroactive to October 7, 1999 (Exh. 7). The respondent claims that after a November 2001 interview in connection with this petition, he had no further contact either from the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS”) or its predecessor the Immigration and Naturalization Service until he was taken into custody by DHS officers on August 21, 2008. By that time, he had moved several times, lost contact with his former attorney, and remarried another United States citizen, through whom he now hopes to adjust his status. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen.
 
After entering the in absentia order of removal, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings, despite the fact that the respondent claimed that he never received service of the Notice to Appear-which was served by regular mail in April 2007 to the address he had provided some 5.5 years earlier during his November 2001 interview. Further, the Notice to Appear contained no hearing date; the hearing notice was mailed later to an address appearing on the Notice to Appear. The respondent claims he received neither notice, and swears in an affidavit that he did not live at any of the three addresses contained on the Notice to Appear. See Motion to Reopen.¿FN2º
 
*2 Here, actual notice of the removal proceedings was not accomplished, and the evidence of record reflects that the respondent was not actually living at any of the addresses listed on the Notice to Appear when it was mailed to him on April 10, 2007.¿FN3º The question is whether constructive notice can be deemed to have been received by the respondent. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows an in absentia order of removal to be entered when the alien is sent written notice “at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F)” of the Act. Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001) (quoting section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act). A “section 239(a)(1)(F) address,” however, is one that is provided and kept current by the alien after being informed of the “particular address requirements associated with removal proceedings.” Matter of G-Y-R-, supra, at 187. Therefore, “¿bºecause that information is first communicated in the Notice to Appear, the alien must receive the Notice to Appear before he or she can ‘provide’ an address in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act.” Id. Here, the evidence reflects that the respondent was not living at any of the addresses listed on the Notice to Appear and did not receive it, or the subsequent notice of additional charges or the hearing. See Exhs. 1, 1A, 2. While doubtless the respondent should have kept the DHS apprised of his changes of address, we cannot agree with the premise of the DHS’s argument that he essentially “invited defective notice” of removal proceedings by failing to do so. Cf. Matter of G-Y-R-, supra, at 188. The fact remains that here, the respondent was not provided with notice of the address obligations specific to removal proceedings, including the potential for entry of an in absentia order of removal, since he never received the Notice to Appear. We therefore will sustain the appeal, reopen proceedings, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this order.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.

The respondent’s motion to reopen below and the Immigration Judge’s order denying the motion refer to a possible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is both undeveloped and not necessary to our resolution of this appeal.

2

The Notice to Appear was mailed to an address on Woodmont Ave. in Detroit, MI, with copies sent to two addresses on Erie St. in Adrian, MI. The Woodmont Ave. address was apparently vacated by the respondent some 5 years prior to the service of the Notice to Appear; one of the Erie St. addresses was apparently good until November 2006 and. See Amended Motion to Reopen.

3

The evidence reflects that as of the mailing of the Notice to Appear, the respondent was living on Point Lane in Ann Arbor, MI, as evidenced by a lease agreement and the respondent’s affidavit.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Torture Convention
 
*1 The respondent had appealed from a September 23, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge finding him removable as charged, denying his request for a continuance, and ordering him removed to Nigeria. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, through counsel, specifically declined to apply for any form of relief, seeking only a continuance to pursue vacatur of his criminal convictions (Tr. at 5-6). The Immigration Judge denied the continuance request, and we adopt and affirm that decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The fact that the respondent may be seeking post-conviction relief in the form of a pending collateral attack on a conviction does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). Moreover, as the Immigration Judge noted, even if the respondent were successful in vacating the two convictions in which he was not advised of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty (Exhs. 3 and 4), the respondent’s remaining conviction for drug trafficking, for which he was given such advisals (Exh. 5), would bar him from relief. Notably, the respondent does not contest this point on appeal.
 
The respondent does, however, assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney for failing to apply for protection under the Torture Convention on his behalf and for seeking a continuance to pursue vacatur of his criminal convictions when none of the convictions were charged in the Notice to Appear. However, he has not even attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent is bound by the tactical decisions of his former counsel, in the absence of egregious circumstances. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). In the instant case, when the Immigration Judge asked the attorney, in the presence of the respondent, whether the respondent has expressed a fear of returning to Nigeria, the attorney replied that the respondent “has not been able to articulate to me a fear” (Tr. at 6). We further note the respondent is incorrect in his argument that criminal convictions that are not charged in the Notice to Appear cannot be used as a basis for finding him ineligible for relief. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria M. Odom, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gregory E. Radics
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. On April 24, 2007, these removal proceedings were initiated by the filing of a Notice to Appear with the Immigration Court. A copy of the charging document was mailed to the respondent at 258 La Grange Street, Newnan, Georgia 30263. That address is reflected on the respondent’s Form I-485 that is contained in the record. The respondent also indicates in her affidavit that the address belongs to her mother who still resides there. On April 30, 2007, the Immigration Court mailed a Notice of Hearing to the respondent at the same address (except that the indicated city was “Newman”) notifying her to appear for a hearing on June 14, 2007. The respondent did not appear on that date, and she was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on December 18, 2007, arguing that her former attorney neglected to inform her that she had been placed in removal proceedings and was scheduled for a hearing. She asserted that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and an “exceptional circumstance” prevented her from appearing for the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on January 29, 2008, and this appeal followed. The record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed more than 180 days after the order of removal was issued, and it was therefore untimely submitted to the extent that it claimed exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and NationalityAct, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The respondent argues on appeal that the motion should have been treated as timely filed because she mailed it to the Immigration Court via express mail on December 13, 2007, and it thus should have been received no later than December 14, 2007. However, December 14, 2007, is 183 days after June 14, 2007. The motion would therefore have been untimely (to the extent it claimed exceptional circumstances) even if the Immigration Court had received it on December 14, 2007. The motion was clearly untimely when it was received by the Immigration Court on December 18, 2007.
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that even if she had filed a timely motion, the respondent failed to establish that attorney negligence prevented her from appearing for her hearing. The respondent contends that her former attorney received both the Notice to Appear and the Notice of Hearing, and he neglected to inform her of such. However, there is no indication that the documents were mailed to the respondent’s former counsel. It is thus unclear how former counsel would have obtained possession of the respondent’s Notice to Appear and Notice of Hearing. According to the respondent, she contacted her former counsel to inform him that she had been taken into custody for failure to appear for her hearing. She states that her former attorney’s assistant first told her that the respondent did not yet have a court case. The respondent indicates that she was later informed by the assistant that he had checked her file and discovered that the respondent had been ordered removed from the United States because she did not appear for her hearing. The respondent asserts that the statement of her former counsel’s assistant proves that former counsel received both notices.
 
*2 We are unable to infer from the alleged statement of the respondent’s former counsel’s assistant that checking the file meant checking the law office’s file. The assistant may have been informed by the Immigration Court that the respondent had been ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent has the burden of proving that deficient performance of counsel caused her to miss her hearing. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). We are unable to find from the respondent’s assertion that such occurred.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened on account of lack of notice, because she did not personally receive either the Notice to Appear or the Notice of Hearing. Although this argument was not specifically raised in the motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge addressed the notice issue in his decision, and no time deadline applies to a motion to reopen to the extent that lack of notice is claimed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(h). We find that resolving the notice issue under the correct legal standards is germane to these proceedings, and it is appropriate to remand the record for the Immigration Judge to resolve the issue in accordance with Dominguez v. United States Attorney General, 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002); and Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). We note that in Matter of G-Y-R-, supra, we set forth a requirement, not addressed in Dominguez, supra, that the required notice be mailed to an address that qualifies under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act as an “address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F),” and we further held that “an address can be a section 239(a)(1)(F) address only if the alien has first been informed,” through receipt of the advisals contained in the Notice to Appear, “of the particular statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address.” Matter of G-Y-R-, supra, at 185, 187 (emphasis in original). Also relevant is the respondent’s allegation in her affidavit that her mother still resides at the La Grange Street address to which the Notice to Appear and Notice of Hearing were sent, but that her mother failed to receive those documents in the mail. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008); and Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicole Hartnett, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ricardo Vega
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on May 1, 2008, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
On July 30, 2008, the respondent, a native and citizen of Greece, filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent presents claims against two former attorneys. He alleges that Mr. Sarikas, who represented him before the Immigration Judge from October 28, 2003, until March 10, 2006, failed to submit a brief in support of the motion to terminate, failed to challenge the charge of inadmissibility alleged in the Notice to Appear, and failed to properly prepare the respondent’s 212(c) waiver application. See Respondent’s Motion at 9-15, Attachment B. The respondent alleges that Mr. Massel failed to withdraw the respondent’s pleading entered by and through Mr. Sarikas.
 
Subsequent to the filing of this motion the Attorney General issued Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (overruling in part Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003)), a decision which significantly changes our approach for addressing such claims. This type of claim, now referred to as a “deficient performance of counsel” claim, may be asserted by a respondent where his prior attorney’s deficient performance likely changed the outcome of the removal proceeding. To prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim, the respondent must establish that his lawyer’s failings were egregious and that his case was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. To establish prejudice, the respondent must show that but for the lawyer’s failing, he likely would have succeeded on the merits of his underlying claim to remain in the United States. If discretionary relief was involved, as in this case, the respondent must also present the evidence he believes would have led to a favorable exercise of discretion.
 
We will address the respondent’s claim against each attorney in turn. First, we consider whether Mr. Sarikas’s performance was deficient and, if so, whether his deficiencies prejudiced the respondent’s case. At the respondent’s June 15, 2005, removal proceeding, Mr. Sarikas was expected to make legal arguments regarding the motion to terminate filed on December 23, 2004 (Tr. at 14). However, instead of arguing that proceedings be terminated, Mr. Sarikas conceded the respondent’s removability and indicated that he would apply for a 212(c) waiver (Tr. at 16-17). At the respondent’s March 10, 2006, removal hearing, the Immigration Judge acknowledged that Mr. Sarikas had been derelict in his duty to the respondent and continued the proceedings so that the respondent could obtain new counsel (Tr. at 21-22, 25).
 
*2 Even if Mr. Sarikas was derelict in his duty, the respondent has failed to show that his performance prejudiced his case. The Immigration Judge gave the respondent additional time to obtain new counsel. The respondent has failed to establish that he is not inadmissible as charged. The respondent is not eligible for the “petty offense” exception under section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II), because the maximum penalty for the crime of which he was convicted is five years imprisonment (Exh. 4.C at 7). The respondent’s reliance on Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 872 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that the new version of section 101(a)(13) of the Act could not be applied retroactively to aliens like the respondent who pled guilty to crimes before its enactment), is misplaced because the instant case arises in the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, not the Ninth Circuit. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31-32 (BIA 1989) (the Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). Additionally, Camins was decided two years after the respondent conceded his inadmissibility before the Immigration Judge.
 
Next, we consider the respondent’s allegations against Mr. Massel. For the reasons stated above, we find no error on Mr. Massel’s part for failing to withdraw the respondent’s pleading. We also reject the respondent’s allegation that Mr. Massel failed to properly advise the respondent regarding his duty to file annual tax returns. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachments B and C. Mr. Massel challenges the respondent’s allegations of misconduct. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment C. He explains that he advised the respondent to file the taxes and that the respondent did not ask when he would be require to pay the taxes. Finally, the respondent, who is seeking discretionary relief, has not presented the evidence he believes would have led to a favorable exercise of discretion.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: PATRICK EARL LILLEY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frances A. King, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen on December 29, 2008, after the Board dismissed his appeal on November 24, 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
 
The respondent was found subject to removal based on a state drug conviction. The respondent presents evidence that, on September 17, 2008, the state court judge allowed the respondent’s motion to vacate his guilty plea. On October 29, 2008, the state dismissed the complaint. The motion to vacate plea argued that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel concerning the immigration consequences of the plea.
 
The Board finds that the evidence presented establishes that the underlying conviction which served as the basis for the respondent being subject to removal has been vacated due to a defect in the criminal proceeding. If a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (conviction vacated pursuant to Ohio law for failure of the trial court to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes).
 
As the respondent is no longer subject to removal from the United States based upon the sole charge against him, removal proceedings against the respondent are terminated.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Viney K. Gupta, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lessa N. Whatmough
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, was ordered removed in absentia on April 3, 1995, by an Immigration Judge. On September 15, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In a decision dated October 16, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. This appeal now follows. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent seeks reopening of these proceedings, contending, among other things, that the in absentia deportation order below was “either self-executed or was issued in error,” because at the time the Immigration Judge entered the in absentia deportation order, he had already departed the United States. See Brief by Appellant submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit at 4 (and incorporated by reference in this appeal). The respondent states that at the time he posted bond and was released from custody, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), was given his new address (42-01, 23rd Ave, Long Island, NY 11105). See Exh. E. By this, the respondent appears to, therefore, suggest that he never received notice of his April 3, 1995, hearing date. See Brief by Appellant submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit at 4.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3) (2008), this Board will defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless those findings are clearly erroneous. We retain independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. See Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon our de novo review of the record, we disagree with the decision below only to the extent that the Immigration Judge found that he lacked jurisdiction over the motion because the respondent had self-deported; the respondent’s departure prior to the entry of a final order of deportation and the conclusion of proceedings did not constitute his “self-deportation.” In other words, there must be first be an order of deportation before an alien’s departure can be construed as deportation or self-deportation under the Act. See 101(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The “departure bar rule” which the Immigration Judge relied on, therefore, was inapplicable to these facts, and the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to consider the motion to rescind. See Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 2008) (the departure bar precludes the filing of a motion by an alien who has departed after the conclusion of proceedings); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23 (b)(1), 1003.2(d) (2008).
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge’s alternative finding, however, that because the respondent received notice of his April 3, 1995, hearing and failed to appear, there are no grounds to rescind the in absentia order of deportation (I.J. at 2). According to the record of proceedings, an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) issued on February 27, 1995, and was personally served on the respondent, as is evidenced by his signature on the OSC (Exh. 1 at 5). On March 13, 1995,aNotice of Hearing issued and was sent care of “PISPC, Los Fresnos, TX,” where the respondent was being held in custody (Exh. 2). When the respondent posted bond on March 13, 1995, therefore, a hearing date had been scheduled and the respondent was apprised of it. While the “Bond Worksheet” confirms the respondent’s assertion that he provided a New York address at the time he posted bond, this does not change the fact that he had notice of his April 3, 1995, hearing date. The respondent, therefore, has not met his burden of proof based on the record evidence. See Section 242B(c)(3).
 
Moreover, based on the record, we find that the respondent has failed to exercise any due diligence in seeking a rescission of his in absentia order of deportation. We have recently held in the context of assessing whether an alien has received notice by regular mail, that an alien can overcome the presumption of delivery by regular mail where, among other things, he exercised due diligence in promptly obtaining counsel and requesting reopening of the proceedings. Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008). See also Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) (setting forth the standards for determining if a respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery that attaches to notices sent by regular mail). Although this case obviously does not involve delivery by regular mail, the respondent has demonstrated a lack of due diligence in requesting rescission of his in absentia order of deportation, now over 12 years since the entry of the Immigration Judge’s decision. In this regard, we note that when he posted bond, the respondent was represented by Legal Aid. Yet, there is no indication in the record that either the respondent or his attorney attempted to seek a continuance before he departed for India to see his “sick mother” on March 21, 1995, which was only a week after he posted bond. See Brief by Appellant submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit at 4. See generally Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988) (an alien is obligated to appear for a scheduled hearing unless and until a request for a continuance is granted). When the respondent entered the United States on August 27, 1995, he again entered without inspection and sought asylum before the DHS under a new name, Dhanna Singh (Exh. I, J) (respondent changed his name on May 4, 1995). He thereafter began living, working, and paying taxes for many years, apparently without ever contacting the immigration court about his deportation case, even though the Immigration Judge’s final order of deportation was sent to the same New York address (42-01, 23rd Ave,, Long Island, NY 11105) he provided when he posted bond. As we have already noted, it was not until 12 1/2 years later that the respondent filed any motion before the Immigration Judge and he only did so because he was being prevented from adjusting his status pursuant to the DHS grant of asylum under his new name. See Brief on Appeal at 2.
 
*3 We conclude that the record establishes notice to the respondent of his April 3, 1995, hearing. It also establishes, moreover, a lack of due diligence in pursuing reopening. To the extent that the respondent has broadly characterized his past legal representation as ineffective, the assertions of counsel do not constitute evidence, Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980), and his assertions fail to even include the names of the attorneys he contends were ineffective in their representation of him.¿FN1º See Notice of Appeal. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), overruling in part Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent has asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from “another former attorney” involved with his petition for habeas corpus relief. See Brief by Appellant submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit at 2. This is a question of due process outside of our consideration, and there are no grounds to find that the DHS acted in a manner that deprived the respondent of due process either. Id. at 7.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Roberto Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert K. Bingham
Special Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 28, 2008, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, was served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) on May 24, 2008, charging him with removability under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). On June 6, 2008, the respondent, following the advice of his former counsel, accepted a grant of voluntary departure to be completed on or before August 5, 2008, with an alternate order of removal to Brazil.
 
On July 31, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen the proceedings along with a request to withdraw the request for voluntary departure and stay his removal. See Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S.1, 128 S.Ct. 2307(2008). The respondent asserts that his former counsel’s performance was deficient because his attorney admitted the allegation in the NTA that the respondent had remained in the United States beyond October 1, 2006, without authorization when in fact he had received authorization to remain until February 28, 2007. Additionally, the respondent’s former counsel advised him to accept a voluntary departure grant when he should have requested a continuance to allow the respondent to fulfill his plans to marry a United States citizen, who could subsequently file a visa petition on his behalf.
 
The respondent proffered with his motion a copy of a disciplinary complaint he filed against his former attorney with the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island; a copy of a marriage certificate indicating the respondent married a United States citizen on July 2, 2008; a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, indicating that the respondent’s wife filed an immediate relative visa petition on his behalf on July 13, 2008, along with a request for a “Good Faith Marriage Exemption;” a Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status; and voluminous evidence to support the bona fides of his marriage. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposed reopening because the Immigration Judge would not likely have granted a continuance absent a marriage that had already taken place.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not complied with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for making a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent had not shown that he notified his former attorney of the charges levied against him or provided him with an opportunity to respond. Therefore, the respondent did not establish a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel which would warrant reopening the proceedings. Nor did the respondent establish that evidence of his relationship with his then-fiancee was unavailable and could not have been presented at the June 6, 2008, hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent does not currently have an approved visa petition to support an adjustment of status application. The Immigration Judge denied the request for a stay of removal as well as reopening, and noted that the respondent’s voluntary departure request had been withdrawn, leaving him subject to an order of removal to Brazil.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent states that he did not personally notify his former attorney of the complaint because the Disciplinary Counsel’s Office was responsible for doing so, and he proffers evidence that his former attorney was notified of the complaint and has since responded. The respondent also asserts that evidence of his marriage to a United States citizen and his wife’s filing of a visa petition on his behalf was not available at the time of his June 6, 2008, hearing.
 
The DHS asserts on appeal that the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion for the reasons stated in the decision. Additionally, the DHS asserts that the respondent failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s performance because it is mere speculation that the Immigration Judge would have granted a continuance on the basis of a marriage which had not yet taken place and a visa petition which had not yet been filed.
 
In Matter of Compean, Bangaly &J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General held that aliens in removal proceedings have no constitutional right to counsel, and therefore no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, and that the Board’s decisions in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), are overruled to the extent they are inconsistent with this conclusion. However, the Attorney General stated that the Department of Justice may, as a matter of administrative grace, reopen removal proceedings where an alien shows that he was prejudiced by the actions of private counsel. An alien who seeks to reopen his removal proceedings based on the deficient performance of his attorney bears the burden of establishing (i) that his lawyer’s failings were egregious; (ii) that in cases where the alien moves to reopen beyond the applicable time limit, he exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to cure his lawyer’s alleged deficient performance; and (iii) that he suffered prejudice from the lawyer’s errors, namely, that but for the deficient performance, it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking. These new substantive standards apply to the instant motion, although new filing requirements set forth in the Attorney General’s decision do not. Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, supra, at 741-42.
 
We find that the respondent has not made out a “deficient performance of counsel” claim because he has not shown that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s alleged errors. In this regard, the fact that the respondent may have been in a valid nonimmigrant status through February 28, 2007, would not alter the finding that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Indeed, the respondent has not challenged his removability. Additionally, we agree with the DHS that the respondent was not prejudiced by his former counsel’s failure to request a continuance to await the respondent’s planned marriage to a United States citizen. The granting or denial of a continuance rests within the sound discretion of an Immigration Judge, who may grant a motion only “for good cause shown.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992). A request to continue proceedings in order to await collateral events, such as marriage followed by the filing of a visa petition, does not generally establish “good cause”’ for a continuance. Therefore, we find that the respondent was not prejudiced by his former counsel’s failure to request a continuance and has not established a claim to deficient performance of counsel.
 
*3 However, we agree with the respondent that his July 2008 marriage to a United States citizen and the subsequent filing of an immediate relative visa petition on the respondent’s behalf constitute new evidence which could not have been discovered or presented at the time of the June 6, 2008, hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. In Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), the Board held that a properly filed motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion, notwithstanding the pendency of a visa petition filed on the alien’s behalf, where: (1) the motion to reopen is timely filed; (2) the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations; (3) the motion is not barred by Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), or any other procedural grounds; (4) clear and convincing evidence is presented indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide; and (5) the DHS does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992). With regard to the fifth factor, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has held that while the Board may consider objections made by the DHS, the Board may not deny a motion to reopen solely on the fact of the DHS’s objection. Melnitsenko v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 42, 48-52 (2d Cir. 2008). Moreover, if the Board denies a motion to reopen based on the merits of the DHS’s objection, the Board must provide adequate reasoning as to why the objection calls for the denial of the motion to reopen in the exercise of discretion. Id.
 
In the instant case, the respondent’s motion to reopen was timely filed, is not numerically barred by the regulations, and is not barred by Matter of Shaar, supra, or any other procedural ground. Additionally, the respondent has provided numerous documents regarding his courtship and marriage to his United States citizen wife, which include, inter alia, a lease agreement signed by the respondent and his wife in June 2007, photographs, affidavits from many individuals, correspondence and emails between the respondent and his wife, correspondence to the respondent and his wife, bills and other documents showing that the respondent and his wife shared the same address, and evidence regarding the planning of their wedding. We find that they presented clear and convincing evidence reflecting a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide. Additionally, we find that the reasons given by the DHS for opposing the motion do not warrant a discretionary denial of the motion. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court to allow the respondent an opportunity to pursue an application for adjustment of status.
 
*4 ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

Jay Marks, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Kamler
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated April 1, 2008,¿FN1º an Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondents filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a). Contrary to the respondents’ appellate contention, the record clearly reflects that the respondents’ former counsel was aware of the September 13, 2004, hearing. See August 27, 2004, Motion to Waive Appearance at Master Calendar Hearing. The motion references the scheduled September 13, 2004, hearing and thus the respondents’ claim that their former counsel was unaware of the hearing is not credible.
 
The respondents further claim that their failure to appear at their hearing was caused by the mis-advice of their former counsel. Specifically, the respondents claim that their former counsel advised them during their August 30, 2004, meeting not to “go to Immigration Court” and further advised the respondents that she would “freeze” the proceedings until such time as she could obtain “amnesty” for them. Respondents’ Motion to Reopen, page 2.
 
An ineffective assistance of counsel claim can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order, pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy certain criteria as set forth in Matter of Compean, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009)(establishing an administrative framework superceding, but drawing upon, the approach set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 639 (BIA 1988)). Although the new document filing requirements established in Matter of Compean, supra, do not apply here because the respondents’ motion was filed on December 12, 2007, prior to the issuance of Matter of Compean, supra, the substantive standards set forth in that decision must be met by the respondents. See Matter of Compean, supra, at 741-742 (holding that the new document filing requirements set forth in this decision only apply to motions filed after the issuance date of this decision (January 1, 2009); for motions filed prior to this decision, the Lozada factors continue to apply).
 
*2 Here, we conclude that the respondents did not comply with the Lozada requirements. Contrary to the respondents’ appellate contention, they are not excused from fulfilling the Lozada requirements simply because former counsel has been suspended from practice. See Matter of Compean, supra, at 739 (holding that an alien must comply with all requirements that apply). In this regard, we observe that the respondents’ claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel is untimely and the respondents have not established that they exercised due diligence to warrant tolling of the 90-day period. Despite knowing they were in removal proceedings, the respondents failed to establish that they acted with due diligence in checking the status of their case.¿FN2º Specifically, the respondents have not explained why they waited until December 1, 2007 — over 3 years after the in absentia order of removal — to file their motion before the Immigration Judge. Matter of Compean, supra, at 732-733 (holding that typically an alien must prove that he made timely inquiries about his immigration status and the progress of his case when alleging deficient performance).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jessica Rodriguez Bell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
G. Michael Wick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the January 4, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge, denying his motion to rescind his in absentia order of removal and reopen proceedings. Both parties have filed briefs on appeal. The Department of Homeland Security has moved for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The motion is denied; the appeal will be dismissed.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent stated that he failed to appear because he did not receive notice of the hearing as a result of his mistake in failing to file his change of address on Form EOIR-33 with the Immigration Court. Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2; Respondent’s Affidavit at 1. In his motion, the respondent states that he had relied on his former counsel to notify the Court, but he does not actually accuse prior counsel of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 2). Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2; Respondent’s Affidavit at 1.
 
The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496-97 (BIA 2008). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s findings that (1) the respondent was placed on notice of the address-reporting obligations under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F), when he was personally served with the Form I-191, Notice to Appear; and (2) he forfeited any ineffective assistance claim against his prior counsel by failing to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (I.J. at 2).¿FN1º See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2007); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 184-85 (BIA 2001).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he has successfully rebutted the presumption that he received notice of his hearing by regular mail. Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 3-5. He bases his argument on a standard that we subsequently adopted in our holdings in Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008), and Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008).
 
However, an important distinction exists between the facts of the above decisions and those of the present case. In the above cited decisions, we considered how a respondent can prove lack of notice where such notice was mailed to the respondent’s proper address, and where the respondent had not moved but the notice nevertheless was not received for unknown reasons, through no fault of the respondent. Id. In the present case, the respondent admits that the notice was not mailed to his correct address, due to his failure to inform the Immigration Court that he had moved. Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2; Respondent’s Affidavit at 1.¿FN2º We therefore find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter of Lozada, supra, has been superceded by the Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compeano, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). As the latter case imposes stricter requirements for establishing ineffective assistance than were required under Lozada, we find this development to have no relevant impact on the Immigration Judge’s determination in the present case.

We further note that the respondent, who filed his motion to reopen nearly 11 months after the entry of the in absentia order, has not established that he exercised due diligence, as required by our holding in Matter of M-R-A-, supra at 674.

File: AXXX XX3 029 - Garden City, NY

IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Elinor Drucker Rahmani, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason Raphael
Associate Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
*1 The petitioner has appealed from the decision of the District Director dated April 18, 2007, denying the visa petition that was submitted on behalf of the beneficiary, the petitioner’s spouse. The District Director concluded that the petitioner failed to submit the evidence necessary to establish the bona fides of the marital relationship between the petitioner and the beneficiary. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefits sought. See Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. See Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989). Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that it was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws.¿FN1º See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). However, we note that the failure to produce affirmative evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the marriage is a sham marriage. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B), (D) with 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(ii).
 
The Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) held separate interviews of the petitioner and the beneficiary on April 16, 2007, to determine the bona fides of the marriage. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983); Matter of McKee, 17 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980). The interviews were recorded and transcribed as required by Stokes v. INS, No. 74, Civ. 1022 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 1976). A transcript of the interview is in the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(h). Following the interviews, the District Director denied the visa petition, concluding that the petitioner failed to prove the existence of a bona fide marital relationship.
 
*2 During the interviews, there were inconsistencies between the testimony of the petitioner and the beneficiary. The petitioner said the beneficiary gave her an engagement ring on the day he proposed. However, the beneficiary said he did not give her an engagement ring when he proposed to her. The petitioner said they did not have an answering machine on their home telephone. However, the beneficiary said they did. The petitioner said they only have one joint bank account, and it is a checking account. However, the beneficiary said the joint account was both a checking and savings account. The petitioner said they always shopped together. However, the beneficiary said he did the shopping by himself. The parties were confronted with these inconsistences at the culmination of the interviews. The petitioner failed to adequately explain these discrepancies. Though there were many consistent answers, and though the petitioner has offered some documentary evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, this evidence is not persuasive and does not overcome the concerns raised by the inconsistent answers. Consequently, we concur that the petitioner has failed to prove the bona fides of the marriage.
 
On appeal, the petitioner also alleges that the CIS officer “disregarded the petitioner’s request and failed to make such accommodations.” However, the petitioner fails to specify what request for accommodation was made and denied. We took note of no request for accommodation in the interview transcript.
 
Also on appeal, the petitioner says: “counsel failed to properly represent the beneficiary and petitioner in that he failed to (1) advise the petitioner that she should submit documentation to substantiate her learning disability, and (2) failed to submit documentation that the petitioner and beneficiary had taken to the interview to substantiate the bonafides of the marriage and (3) did not allow the petitioner to offer explanations to clarify the discrepancies.” However, the petitioner has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Compean, Bangaly, J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (AG 2009); See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Moreover, at the outset of the interview, the parties both indicated that they understood the purpose of the interview, understood their rights and privileges, understood that they had the right to remain silent and that any statements must be given freely and voluntarily, and understood that the requested documentation was intended to prove the claimed marital relationship. See Tr. at 2-3. We also note that, while the questioning was occurring, the only time the petitioner indicated that she could not understand a question was when she was asked the length of the beneficiary’s commute. However, when the officer clarified his question, she was able to answer it. See Tr. at 28. It was only after the parties were confronted with the inconsistencies that the petitioner said that she had a learning disability. See Tr. at 37.
 
*3 The petitioner may, of course, file a new visa petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by additional evidence of the bona fides of the marriage.¿FN2º
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hilda E. Quinto, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary Departure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the January 23, 2008, decision of an Immigration Judge, finding him removable as charged, and denying him the privilege of voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent states that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in denying him voluntary departure and in allegedly calling him a “criminal” on the record when his good moral character was not in issue. See Notice of Appeal from a Decision of an Immigration Judge. He also contends that he was denied due process by the Immigration Judge and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Id.
 
This Board reviews findings of fact by the Immigration Judge to determine whether such findings are clearly erroneous. This Board conducts de novo review of all questions of law, discretion, and judgment. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 10O3.1(d)(3)(i) and (ii) (2008).
 
Upon de novo review, we find that the denial of voluntary departure was not an abuse of discretion. We specifically note that there was no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has a criminal record; the respondent acknowledged during the hearing that he does have a criminal record, and its presence and the nature of that record are appropriate factors to weigh-in deciding whether to favorably exercise discretion in the respondent’s favor (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 5-6, 10-11). See Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. 811, 817 (BIA 1999), citing to Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972) (many factors may be weighed in exercising discretion including the nature and underlying circumstances of the deportation ground at issue; additional violations of the immigration laws; the existence, seriousness, and recency of any criminal record; and other evidence of bad character or the undesirability of the applicant as a permanent resident). We note moreover that the statements provided on appeal fail to meaningfully address the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion or his consideration of the factors of record.
 
To the extent that the respondent is challenging the fundamental fairness of these proceedings, his generalized assertions neither prove that he suffered prejudice as a result of how the Immigration Judge conducted these proceedings nor prove that he suffered prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s representation of him. As to the latter, the respondent vaguely states on appeal that his attorney “failed to request available relief.” It is not clear what other relief he believes he was eligible for, besides voluntary departure (Tr. at 4) (statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal). While the respondent did testify below, contrary to his attorney’s representation, that he entered the United States in 1990 (Tr. at 3, 5), which would suggest possible eligibility for cancellation of removal, he has failed to provide any additional evidence to clarify the issue of his date of entry or otherwise demonstrate that his counsel rendered deficient performance in representing him on this claim. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), overruling in part Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (changing the substantive standards (effective immediately and for all claims and motions) and the procedural standards (effective prospectively, for future claims and motions only) by which claims involving attorneys will be judged, and holding that such claims will now be called “deficient performance of counsel” claims). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

IN RE: JIAN LE YOU
File: AXXX XX3 384 - San Diego, CA
January 14, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alphan K. Tsoi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 Based upon a joint motion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has remanded this matter in which we previously denied a motion to reopen. You v. Mukasey, No. 07-72894 (9th Cir. September 4, 2008). The instant motion, filed on December 14, 2006, was the respondent’s third motion to reopen in these proceedings and requested reopening based upon the ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will once again be denied.
 
On October 17, 2002, the respondent’s counsel, Attorney Louis Leeder, filed a motion before the Immigration Judge to change venue from San Diego to New York. On November 12, 2002, the respondent was ordered removed when neither he nor his counsel appeared at the hearing held in San Diego. On November 21, 2002, Attorney Leeder filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, attaching an affidavit from the respondent stating that he assumed that, since his attorney had filed a motion to change venue and had not received a response from either opposing counsel or the Immigration Judge, the change of venue motion had been granted. See 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.23(b)(4)(h). The affidavit also indicated that the respondent contacted Attorney Leeder on the day after the scheduled hearing, and it was not until then that counsel determined that the hearing had gone forward as scheduled and the respondent had been ordered removed. Because the respondent conceded that he had received notice of the scheduled hearing, and a filed motion to change venue does not excuse a failure to appear, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to rescind. Hernandez-Vivas v. INS, 23 F.3d 1557, 1559 (9th Cir. 1994) (the mere filing of a motion to change venue does not establish reasonable cause for not being at the hearing where the motion has not been granted); Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953, 954 (BIA 1999).
 
On January 30, 2003, the respondent, acting pro se, filed a second motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, making essentially the same argument as that made in the first motion. On February 19, 2003, the Immigration Judge denied the second motion to reopen and rescind. The respondent filed a notice of appeal (Form EOIR-26) of this last decision, acting pro se once again. On March 2, 2004, we dismissed the appeal. On December 14, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen the matter, represented by new counsel.
 
The joint motion granted by the Ninth Circuit notes that our July 6, 2007, decision indicates that we denied the motion:
*2 … based upon three reasons: (1) the motion was ‘long since untimely’ …(citing 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(c)); (2) a showing had not been made the ‘exceptional circumstances’ exception of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (providing 180 days to file a motion to reopen in cases culminated by an in absentia orders ¿sicº) applied to excuse Mr. You’s failure to file the motion within 90 days ¿sic¿FN1º of the Immigration Judge’s November 12, 2002, in absentia removal order; and (3) a showing had not been made that equitable tolling was warranted in that Mr. You had not shown he exercised due diligence in filing ‘the motion nearly three years’ after the Board issued its March 2, 2004 final order denying his second motion to reopen. (The Parties’ Joint Motion to Dismiss the Petition for Review and For Remand to the Agency at 2 (emphasis included)(hereinafter “Joint Motion”)).
 
The joint motion notes further that this Board’s July 6, 2007, order was issued after the Ninth Circuit published its opinion in Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2007), which held that there must be a two-question factual inquiry into whether or not the respondent exercised due diligence regarding the alleged ineffective assistance sufficient to warrant equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. Joint Motion at 2, citing see INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 17 (2002); see also Thomas v. Gonzalez, 409 F.3d 1117, 1189 (9th Cir. 2005). The Joint Motion requests that the case be returned to the Board to provide us an opportunity to consider the due diligence requirement of equitable tolling under the two question factual inquiry identified in Gharemani. Consequently, we do so herein.
 
The first question of the inquiry is when did the alien learn of the alleged ineffectiveness. Joint Motion at 2 n. 1, citing see Ghahremani v. Gonzales, supra at 998. The alien’s affidavit must be accepted as true unless a finding is made that the assertions made therein are inherently unbelievable. Id., citing Maroufi v. INS, 772 F.2d 597, 600 (9th Cir. 1985). In this matter, the motion argues essentially that Attorney Leeder filed the motion to change venue and assured the respondent that venue would be changed, but the motion was not granted, and the respondent was subsequently ordered removed in absentia when he failed to show up for the hearing scheduled in San Diego (Motion to Reopen filed December 14, 2006, at 2). An affidavit from the respondent is included in which he states, with regard to the ineffective assistance, that he went to an organization and talked with a Mr. Lao Yu who obtained Attorney Leeder to represent the respondent (Id., at Respondent’s October 4, 2006, affidavit). About 2 or 3 days prior to the scheduled hearing, the respondent met with Mr. Yu who called Attorney Leeder who assured that venue would be changed and the respondent should return home and wait for notice. The affidavit states that the respondent went to the Leeder law firm on November 13, 2002, and the attorney then discovered that the respondent had been ordered removed in absentia, whereupon the attorney filed the first motion to reopen. Consequently, taken at face value and accepting the affidavit as true, the respondent learned of the alleged ineffectiveness on November 13, 2002.
 
*3 The second question of the inquiry is when did the alien retain new counsel and file for reconsideration and reopening. Joint Motion citing Ghahremani v. Gonzales, supra at 999. Notwithstanding the obvious evidence of attorney ineffectiveness, the respondent allowed that attorney to pursue the first motion to reopen, which was denied. Rather than filing an appeal of the first motion, or obtaining another attorney, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen pro se, which was also denied. The respondent then filed an appeal, and that was dismissed. In his affidavit, the respondent states that he went to a travel service agency, which provided assistance in filing the pro se motion in 2003, and then consulted with “a few” lawyers during the subsequent two to three years, but no details are provided about these consultations. Consequently, there is no adequate explanation as to why it took a minimum of two years to obtain counsel to file the instant motion.
 
We therefore once again conclude that the respondent has not acted with due diligence to address the ineffective assistance provided by Attorney Leeder in a timely manner. Cf. Ghahremani v. Gonzales, supra at 996-96, 1000 (finding that at no point following the association with the ineffective counsel did the respondent fail to investigate and pursue relief from removal; motion to reopen, although filed outside of the 90 day limit, was filed within ten months of the final decision); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: KEYVAN MOBED MEHDIABADI
File: AXXX XX8 039 - Los Angeles, CA
January 13, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Harsh Chhabra, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Iran. He was ordered removed from the United States on August 27, 2004, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on March 11, 2008, but the Immigration Judge denied it on May 8, 2008. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he was the victim of the negligent advice provided by a non-attorney, and therefore an exceptional circumstance prevented his appearance from the hearing. The respondent’s motion was filed more than 180 days after his order of removal was entered. The motion was thus filed untimely. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The Board may equitably toll the 180-day period to seek reopening if an alien has been the victim of attorney negligence, and he seeks reopening with due diligence after becoming aware of such. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710(A.G. 2009); Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
The respondent indicates in his affidavit filed with his motion to reopen that a non-attorney told him that it was not necessary for him to appear for his hearing because he was the beneficiary of a pending employment-based visa petition. He further indicates that he met with the non-attomey several months later and informed him that the respondent had been ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent states that he asked the non-attorney for an explanation regarding the misinformation that he was given. According to the respondent, the non-attorney would not take responsibility for his mistake. Supplied with the motion was also a complaint filed against the non-attorney with the California Bar Association. The respondent repeats therein his allegation raised in his affidavit and again states that the non-attorney told him that he was not responsible for the Immigration Judges’s decision to order his removal from the United States in absentia.
 
We do not find it appropriate to equitably toll the 180-day period for reopening. Even if we did so, the Board would only toll the reopening period to the date that the respondent received the order of removal and met with the non-attorney to discuss it. It is clear that the respondent was aware in January 2005 that he may have received poor legal advice. It was thus incumbent on him to diligently seek reopening. See Singh v. Gonzales, supra. The respondent did not do so until approximately three years had elapsed. His inaction is demonstrative of the lack of diligence exercised herein. The motion is therefore time-barred from consideration.¿FN1º
 
*2 The respondent further alleged on appeal that he believed that the non-attorney was an attorney. He did not mention this assertion in the motion to reopen. It is also unclear why the respondent would have even thought that his advisor was an attorney since the non-attorney worked for an agency named Advanced Paralegal Services. In addition, he presented no evidence that the agency or the non-attorney represented that attorneys were handling immigration matters for the agency. See Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting that an alien’s knowing reliance on a non-attorney’s advice will not support a due process violation); Singh-Bhathal v. I.N.S., 170 F.3d 943 (9th Cir. 1999). See also Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that there is a “crucial difference” between ineffective assistance of counsel and ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that the respondent has filed a new declaration on appeal. The Board does not consider such evidence. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (noting that the Board does not consider evidence first introduced on appeal). We observe, however, that the information contained in the declaration is inconsistent with the statements in the original affidavit and bar complaint. The respondent alleges in the new declaration that the non-attorney advised him when they met after the issuance of the removal order that the respondent would not be removed from the United States because of the pending visa petition. Such was not mentioned in the original affidavit or bar complaint. We also observe that the respondent has not alleged in the new declaration that the non-attorney advised him not to immediately file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Renae M. Hansell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(2)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(B)º - Multiple criminal convictions
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination; section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has appealed an Immigration Judge’s September 3, 2008, decision ordering him removed to Nigeria. In addition, the respondent has filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel and a motion to terminate removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The respondent’s motions will be denied, and his appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent adjusted his status to that of lawful permanent resident on July 24, 1987. Subsequently, on May 16, 1989, he was convicted in the State Court of Fulton County Georgia for the offense of simple battery and sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment On February 11, 1992, the respondent was convicted of writing a bad check and sentenced to 12 months confinement, suspended. Further, on March 6, 1998, the respondent was convicted of driving with a suspended license and sentenced to 5 years confinement to be served on probation. He was also convicted on March 1, 1999, of a felony habitual offender offense and sentenced to 5 years confinement to be served on probation. See The DHS’s Brief Regarding Eligibility for section 212(c) Relief.
 
The Immigration Judge deemed the respondent to have abandoned any applications for relief from removal for failure to file any applications within the time set for filing (I.J. at 2). In addition, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent, through his attorney, admitted the factual allegations on the Notice to Appear and conceded removability.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges that he was denied due process because of ineffective assistance of his former counsel. In particular, he asserts that his former attorney failed to challenge the charges of removability, failed to file an application for relief from removal and to respond to his inquiries for information. The respondent, however, has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Further, in order to succeed in reopening removal proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. In this case, as explained below, the respondent cannot demonstrate prejudice from his attorney’s conduct because he is removable as charged and is not eligible for any relief from removal.
 
*2 First, with regard to the respondent’s argument that his 1992 conviction for writing a bad check is not a crime involving moral turpitude, the Board has already addressed this argument and the exact Georgia statute under which the respondent was convicted in Matter of Bart, 20 I&N Dec. 436 (BIA 1992). In that case we held that the Georgia statute does not expressly require intent to defraud as an element of the crime, but Georgia courts have unequivocally held that intent to defraud is an essential element of section 16-9-20(a)of the Georgia Code. Matter of Bart, supra, at 438. Thus, a conviction under section 16-9-20(a) is a crime involving moral turpitude, and the Immigration Judge correctly found the respondent removable on that basis.
 
The respondent also argues that he was wrongly charged with removability under section 212(a)(2)(B) of the Act because his aggregate sentences do not amount to 5 years or more. He attaches evidence to his motion to terminate proceedings showing that his March 1, 1999, conviction was vacated and a new adjudication of guilt was entered with a lesser sentence (Exh. 4). In addition, the respondent’s March 6, 1998, conviction was discharged under a First Offender Act (Exh. 5). With regard to the March 1, 1999, conviction, the court set aside and vacated it and entered an adjudication of guilt regarding the DUI and habitual violator counts, with the imposition of sentences of 12 months for each count. This would be a modification of the respondent’s sentence, which is entitled to full faith and credit. Matter of Cota- Vargas, 23 I&N Dec. 849, 852 (BIA 2005). However, the conviction would still be valid for immigration purposes. See Matter of Marroquin, 23 I&N Dec. 705, 714 (A.G. 2005). In addition, the state court’s order discharging adjudication of guilt on the March 6, 1998, conviction would not serve to vacate that conviction for immigration purposes because the merits of the conviction have not been called into question. See Matter of Marroquin, 23 I&N Dec. 705, 714 (A.G. 2005). As such, the respondent has been convicted for immigration purposes of two offenses for which the aggregate sentences to confinement were 5 years or more and is thus inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(B) of the Act. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings is denied.
 
The respondent further claims that his prior attorney should have filed an application for relief and that he is eligible for sections 212(c) and 212(h) waivers of inadmissibility. However, as the respondent’s attorney conceded, he is not eligible for relief (Tr. at 32). First, the respondent could seek a waiver of his 1992 conviction for writing bad checks, but even if granted, he would be removable as an aggravated felon because of his simple battery conviction. The respondent’s 1989 conviction for simple battery qualifies as a “crime of violence” and, therefore, an aggravated felony. Section 101 (a)(43)(F) of the Act defines the term “aggravated felony” to include a “crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment ¿ isº at least one year.” See section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act; 18 U.S.C. § 16. The term “crime of violence” means; (a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 16. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, has held, the Georgia simple battery statute has as an element “physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature.” Ga.Code Ann. § 16-5-23(a)(1). A person cannot make physical contact, particularly of an insulting or provoking nature, with another without exerting some level of physical force. United States v. Griffith, 455 F.3d 1339, 1341-42 (11th Cir. 2006). As such, the respondent’s simple battery conviction is a crime of violence and an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act. The respondent cannot receive a section 212(c) waiver of a crime of violence because the aggravated felony ground of removal has no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act. See Matter of Brieva, 23 I&N Dec. 766, 770-73 (BIA 2005). Further, the respondent is ineligible for a section 212(c) waiver of his 1998 and 1999 convictions. Moreover, the respondent is ineligible for a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act because he has been convicted of an aggravated felony. See section 212(h) of the Act; Matter of Ayala, 22 I&N Dec. 398 (BIA 1998).
 
*3 Finally, the respondent argues that he has been detained improperly and that he is eligible for conditional release because he does not pose a significant risk of flight and danger to the community. However, because the respondent is charged with inadmissibility under sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and 212(a)(2)(B) of the Act, he is subject to mandatory detention under section 236(c)(1)(A) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings is denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:

APPLICATION: Reissuing; voluntary departure
 
This case was last before the Board on March 6, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal regarding the denial of asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, as well as his appeal of the adverse credibility finding. However, we remanded for the purpose of allowing the respondent to apply for voluntary departure. On April 9, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the request for voluntary departure because he determined that the respondent was not requesting voluntary departure and had no desire to leave the United States voluntarily. In fact, on remand, the respondent explicitly stated that he would like to be deported by the Government (Tr. at 54). The respondent, a native and citizen of India, now appeals. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2008). On appeal, the respondent does not seek voluntary departure but rather requests that we reissue our March 6, 2007, order so he may seek judicial review of the denial of relief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Respondent’s Br. at 3). We therefore will construe the respondent’s appeal to be a motion to reissue. The motion will be denied.
 
Under the circumstances of this case, it is evident that no legitimate basis exists for us to reissue our March 6, 2007, decision. It is the policy of this Board to disturb the finality of our decisions by means of reissuing only if some administrative error at the Board has resulted in a defect of service, which, if not corrected, would prevent a party from perfecting a timely appeal or complying with a voluntary departure deadline. We also have reissued decisions in order to remedy a lack of notice arising from the ineffective assistance of counsel, i.e., in a case in which the alien’s attorney received notice of our decision but failed to inform the alien of such receipt until after the relevant filing deadline had passed. Furthermore, our authority to reissue decisions cannot extend beyond the scope of our appellate jurisdiction set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b). Thus, an implicit qualification on our power to reissue a decision is that such reissuing be necessary to safeguard the fairness of a proceeding over which we have jurisdiction.
 
The respondent does not allege that his difficulty in obtaining judicial review is a result of any administrative error on the Board’s part or his counsel of record, nor will the fairness of his administrative removal proceedings be compromised if we do not reissue our prior decision. Instead, the respondent’s difficulty results from the filing requirements of section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, a judicial statute over which we have no jurisdiction. We also note that the respondent requested voluntary departure as part of his prior appeal. He cannot now claim that our decision to remand to allow him to apply for voluntary departure “created a procedural conundrum” (Respondent’s Br. at 3).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reissue our prior order will be denied.

MATTER OF ENRIQUE SALAS COMPEAN, RESPONDENT
MATTER OF SYLLA BANGALY, RESPONDENT
MATTER OF J-E-C-, ET AL., RESPONDENTS
File A078 566 977 - Houston, Texas
File A078 555 848 - Houston, Texas
Decided by Attorney General January 7, 2009
**1 *710 (1) Aliens in removal proceedings have a statutory privilege to retain private counsel at no expense to the Government.
 
(2) Aliens in removal proceedings have no right to counsel, including Government-appointed counsel, under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution because the Sixth Amendment applies only to criminal proceedings and removal proceedings are civil in nature.
 
(3) Aliens in removal proceedings also have no right to counsel, including Government-appointed counsel, under the Fifth Amendment. Although the Fifth Amendment applies to removal proceedings, its guarantee of due process does not include a general right to counsel, or a specific right to effective assistance of counsel, and is violated only by state action, namely, action that can be legally attributed to the Government. Lawyers privately retained by aliens in removal proceedings are not state actors for due process purposes. Accordingly, there is no Fifth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. To the extent the Board’s decisions in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), are inconsistent with this conclusion, those decisions are overruled.
 
(4) Although the Constitution and the immigration laws do not entitle an alien in removal proceedings to relief for his lawyer’s mistakes, the Department of Justice may, as a matter of administrative grace, reopen removal proceedings where an alien shows that he was prejudiced by the actions of private counsel.
 
(5) There is a strong public interest in ensuring that a lawyer’s deficiencies do not affirmatively undermine the fairness and accuracy of removal proceedings. At the same time, there is a strong public interest in the expeditiousness and finality of removal proceedings. On balance, these interests justify allowing the Board to reopen removal proceedings in the extraordinary case where a lawyer’s deficient performance likely changed the outcome of an alien’s initial removal proceedings. In addition, they call for a set of standards and requirements that will allow the Board to resolve most claims expeditiously and on the basis of an alien’s motion to reopen and accompanying documents alone. Whether an alien has made a sufficient showing to warrant relief based *711 on counsel’s allegedly deficient performance is, in each case, committed to the discretion of the Board or the immigration judge.
 
(6) The deficient performance of counsel claim extends only to the conduct of a lawyer, an accredited representative, or a non-lawyer that the alien reasonably but erroneously believed to be a lawyer who was retained to represent the alien in the proceedings.
 
**2 (7) An alien who seeks to reopen his removal proceedings based on deficient performance of counsel bears the burden of establishing (i) that his lawyer’s failings were egregious; (ii) that in cases where the alien moves to reopen beyond the applicable time limit, he exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to cure his lawyer’s alleged deficient performance; and (iii) that he suffered prejudice from the lawyer’s errors, namely, that but for the deficient performance, it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking.
 
(8) An alien who seeks to reopen his removal proceedings based on deficient performance of counsel must submit a detailed affidavit setting forth the facts that form the basis of the deficient performance of counsel claim. He also must attach to his motion five documents or sets of documents: (i) a copy of his agreement, if any, with the lawyer whose performance he alleges was deficient; (ii) a copy of a letter to his former lawyer specifying the lawyer’s deficient performance and a copy of the lawyer’s response, if any; (iii) a completed and signed complaint addressed to, but not necessarily filed with, the appropriate State bar or disciplinary authority; (iv) a copy of any document or evidence, or an affidavit summarizing any testimony, that the alien alleges the lawyer failed to submit previously; and (v) a statement by new counsel expressing a belief that the performance of former counsel fell below minimal standards of professional competence. If any of these documents is unavailable, the alien must explain why. If any of these documents is missing rather than nonexistent, the alien must summarize the document’s contents in his affidavit. Matter of Lozada, superseded.
 
(9) The Board’s discretion to reopen removal proceedings on the basis of a lawyer’s deficient performance is not limited to conduct that occurred during the agency proceedings. The Board may reopen on the basis of deficient performance that occurred subsequent to the entry of a final order of removal if the standards established for a deficient performance of counsel claim are satisfied.

*712 BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (January 7, 2009)
 
**3 On August 7, 2008, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(h)(1)(i) (2007), I directed the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”) to refer to me for review its decisions in the above-captioned cases, and I invited the parties and any interested amici to submit briefs addressing the questions I planned to consider on certification.
 
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying opinion, I affirm the Board’s orders denying reopening in the certified cases and overrule the Board’s decisions in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), to the extent those decisions are inconsistent with the legal conclusions and administrative framework set forth in the opinion.
  
OPINION
 
The Supreme Court has recognized constitutional claims for ineffective assistance of counsel only where a person has a constitutional right to a Government-appointed lawyer. In contrast to a defendant in a criminal case, an alien has no right—constitutional or statutory—to Government-appointed counsel in an administrative removal proceeding. Compare section 240(b)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA” or “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A) (2006) (providing that an alien has a “privilege of being represented, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the alien’s choosing”), and section 292 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362 (2006), with U.S. Const. amend. VI (“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall … have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.”), and Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). The question before me is whether, notwithstanding the absence of a constitutional right to a Government-appointed lawyer, there is nevertheless a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. More specifically, the question is whether the Constitution entitles an alien who has been harmed by his lawyer’s deficient performance in removal proceedings to redo those proceedings.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (“Lozada”), the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”) responded to an alien’s constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by assuming, consistent with the earlier rulings of two Federal courts of appeals, that an alien “may” have a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 638. Having thus accepted the potential existence of such a right, the Board’s decision established three threshold requirements—commonly known as the “Lozada factors”—that an *713 alien must satisfy to reopen his removal proceedings on the basis of lawyer error. The Board revisited these issues 15 years later in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (“Assaad”), in response to a claim from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) that Supreme Court precedent in criminal and habeas cases undermined the notion of a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. The Board acknowledged “some ambiguity in the basis set forth in [Lozada] for [aliens] to assert ineffective assistance claims,” but declined to overrule its prior decision. Id. at 558. Among the reasons cited by the Board, one loomed large: “[S]ince Matter of Lozada was decided 15 years ago, the circuit courts have consistently continued to recognize that … [an alien] has a Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair immigration hearing and may be denied that right if counsel prevents the respondent from meaningfully presenting his or her case.” Id. (citing cases).
 
**4 Five years later, that condition no longer holds, as several courts of appeals, relying on the same Supreme Court precedent that the INS had cited in Assaad, have rejected the proposition that there is a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. See, e.g., Rafiyev v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 853, 861 (8th Cir. 2008); Afanwi v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 788, 798-99 (4th Cir. 2008); Magala v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 523, 525 (7th Cir. 2005); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006) (suggesting the same in dictum); Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 500-01 (7th Cir. 2001) (same and noting that the “question whether there is ever a constitutional right to [effective assistance of] counsel in immigration cases is ripe for reconsideration”). In addition, the courts of appeals that continue to recognize the constitutional right have diverged with respect to the standards and requirements for a successful ineffective assistance claim. Some courts, for example, have applied a strict standard of prejudice while others have not; some have treated the Lozada factors as mandatory while others have not.
 
Because of the circuit splits on these important issues, and the resulting patchwork of rules governing motions to reopen removal proceedings in different parts of the country, I ordered the Board to refer these matters to me so that I could review the Board’s position on both the constitutional question and the question of how best to resolve an alien’s claim that his removal proceeding was prejudiced by his lawyer’s errors. See Att’y Gen. Order Nos. 2990-2008, 2991-2008, & 2992-2008 (Aug. 7, 2008); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(h)(1)(i) (2008); cf. Matter of R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 629, 631 (Att’y Gen. 2008) (stressing the importance of a “consistent, authoritative, nationwide interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the immigration laws”). To aid my review, I invited the parties and any interested amici curiae to submit briefs addressing the constitutional question. I invited them to address also whether, if there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, an alien *714 nevertheless should be permitted, as a matter of administrative discretion, to reopen removal proceedings based on his lawyer’s deficient performance.1
 
I conclude, as have a growing number of Federal courts, that the Constitution does not confer a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. The reason is simple: Under Supreme Court precedent, there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel under the Due Process Clause or any other provision where—as here and as in most civil proceedings—there is no constitutional right to counsel, including Government-appointed counsel, in the first place. Therefore, although the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause applies in removal proceedings, as it does in any civil lawsuit or in any administrative proceeding, that Clause does not entitle an alien to effective assistance of counsel, much less the specific remedy of a second bite at the apple based on the mistakes of his own lawyer.
 
**5 However, the foregoing conclusion does not foreclose a remedy for aliens prejudiced by their lawyers’ errors, because the Department of Justice is not limited to the very least that the Constitution demands. Although the Constitution does not entitle an alien to relief for his lawyer’s mistakes, I conclude that the Department may, in its discretion, allow an alien to reopen removal proceedings based on the deficient performance of his lawyer. Balancing the strong public interest in the fairness and accuracy of removal proceedings with the strong public interest in the finality of completed proceedings, I establish in this opinion an administrative framework for the exercise of that discretion. In extraordinary cases, where a lawyer’s deficient performance likely changed the outcome of an alien’s removal proceedings, the Board may reopen those proceedings notwithstanding the absence of a constitutional right to such relief. Applying this administrative framework to the three cases before me, I affirm the Board’s orders.
  
I.
 
I begin with a brief summary of the certified matters. In Matter of Compean, respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, unlawfully entered the United States in 1989. In 2004, he was placed in removal proceedings and sought cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge denied respondent’s *715 request on the ground that he had failed to establish the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” required by section 240A(b)(l)(D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(l)(D) (2006), and ordered him removed from the United States. After the Board affirmed on the merits, respondent filed a motion to reopen on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. Respondent’s self-described “most important” claim was that his former lawyer had failed to present evidence of a pending Form I-130 visa petition, although in point of fact that form had been part of the record before the Immigration Judge. In May 2008, the Board denied the motion on two grounds. First, the Board found that respondent had not filed a complaint with disciplinary authorities regarding his lawyer’s deficient representation or explained his failure to do so, as required by Lozada. Second, noting that respondent had not produced any evidence that his lawyer’s conduct precluded him from presenting before the Immigration Judge, the Board concluded that respondent had failed to establish that he had suffered prejudice from his lawyer’s actions.
 
In Matter of Bangaly, respondent, a native and citizen of Mali, entered the United States in 1998 on a non-immigrant visa, which he unlawfully overstayed. He was placed in removal proceedings in 2003. Respondent subsequently obtained several continuances because he had filed for adjustment of status based upon his 2002 marriage to a United States citizen. In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security denied respondent’s request for adjustment of status because his wife had failed three times to appear for an interview. The Immigration Judge denied respondent’s request for a further continuance so that he could seek reopening of his adjustment of status petition and ordered him removed. Respondent’s lawyer filed a notice of appeal, which stated that respondent would challenge the denial of the additional continuance. Respondent’s lawyer never filed an appellate brief, however, and in 2005 the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s order. Approximately 2 years later, respondent moved to reopen his removal proceedings. Respondent alleged that his former counsel’s failure to file an appellate brief and to notify him that his appeal had been summarily denied constituted ineffective assistance of counsel but did not explain how he had been prejudiced by these failures. In March 2008, the Board denied respondent’s motion because he had failed to comply with one of Lozada’s requirements: He had not given his former counsel a chance to respond to his allegations of ineffective representation.
 
**6 Finally, in Matter of J-E-C-, the lead respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, was admitted to the United States in 2000 on a 6-month visa. His wife and children, also respondents, were admitted in 2001, on 6-month visas as well. Lead respondent then sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture on his own behalf and derivatively for his wife and children. In 2003, the Department of Homeland *716 Security found respondents ineligible for relief and began removal proceedings. In those proceedings, lead respondent conceded removability, but renewed his application for asylum and withholding of removal. The Immigration Judge denied relief, concluding that, among other things, lead respondent had failed to demonstrate persecution “on account of” a protected ground, and ordered respondents removed. Respondents’ lawyer filed a notice of appeal with the Board alleging four points of error, but the Board never received a brief in support of the appeal. Notwithstanding the absence of a brief, the Board addressed the four points of error on the merits, and affirmed what it called the “thorough and well-reasoned decision” of the Immigration Judge. Thereafter, respondents moved to reopen, contending that counsel’s failure to file a brief constituted ineffective assistance and submitting a copy of the brief they would have submitted. In April 2008, the Board denied respondents’ motion. Noting its previous decision addressing the merits of the claims, and reviewing those claims again, the Board concluded that respondents had suffered no prejudice from the failure to file a brief because a brief would not have changed the outcome of their proceedings.
  
II.
 
Several uncontroversial propositions inform whether there is a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. A removal proceeding is a civil action, not a criminal proceeding. See, e.g., INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (“A deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country, not to punish an unlawful entry.”); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 594 (1952) (“Deportation, however severe its consequences, has been consistently classified as a civil rather than a criminal procedure.”).2 Therefore, the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee that, in all “criminal prosecutions,” an “accused shall … have the Assistance of counsel for his defence” does not apply. See, e.g., Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 237 (1960) ( “[D]eportation proceedings are not subject to the constitutional safeguards for criminal prosecutions.”). Accordingly, the Federal courts uniformly have held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel (which includes the right to Government-appointed counsel) does not apply in removal proceedings. See, e.g., Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003); United States v. Loaisiga, 104 F.3d 484, 485 (1st Cir. 1997); Delgado-Corea v. INS, 804 F.2d 261, 262 (4th Cir. 1986); United States v. Cerda-Pena, 799 F.2d 1374, 1376 n.2 (9th Cir. 1986). The corresponding *717 Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685-86 (1984), does not apply either. See, e.g., Afanwi, 526 F.3d at 796 & n.31 (citing cases).
 
**7 Unlike the Sixth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which provides that “[n]o person shall … be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” applies to civil and criminal proceedings alike. Moreover, that Clause applies to “all ‘persons’ within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001). Therefore, it is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles all aliens who have entered the United States to due process of law in removal proceedings. See, e.g., Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993); see also Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212 (1953) ( “[A]liens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law.”).
 
The Fifth Amendment’s due process guarantee, however, applies only against the Government. See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976) (stating that the Due Process Clause applies only to “governmental decisions which deprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment”) (emphasis added). Thus, the actions of a private party, including a privately retained lawyer, can give rise to a due process claim only if those actions can be attributed to the Government for constitutional purposes. See, e.g., San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522, 542-43 (1987) (stating that where a plaintiff alleges a violation of the Fifth Amendment, “[t]he fundamental inquiry is whether the [defendant] is a governmental actor to whom the prohibitions of the Constitution apply”); cf. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13 (1948) (stating that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful”). The question presented in these cases, therefore, is whether the conduct of a privately retained lawyer can be attributed to the Government for Due Process Clause purposes such that a litigant’s general right to due process with respect to state action would include a specific right to effective representation by that private lawyer.
 
*718 In the usual civil case, the answer to this question is a resounding no.3 It is well established that, as a general matter, there is no constitutional right to counsel, and thus no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, in civil cases. See, e.g., MacCuish v. United States, 844 F.2d 733, 735 (10th Cir. 1988) (citing cases). Instead, the rule is that counsel’s errors are imputed to the client who chose his counsel, and that the client’s sole remedy is a suit for malpractice against counsel and not a litigation do-over. See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, 507 U.S. 380, 397 (1993); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 92 (1990); Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. 626, 634 n.10 (1962);Magala, 434 F.3d at 525. That is true even when the case is complex or the stakes are especially high. Indeed, “[t]he non-right to effective assistance of counsel in civil cases is the rule even when the proceeding though nominally civil involves liberty or even life, as in a capital habeas corpus case, where the Supreme Court has held that there is no right to effective assistance of counsel.” Stroe, 256 F.3d at 500 (citing Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1 (1989), and Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551(1987)).
 
**8 Despite the foregoing uncontroversial principles, several courts of appeals have suggested or held that the Due Process Clause creates a right to effective *719 assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. See, e.g., Nehad v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir. 2008); Arts v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 600-01 (2d Cir. 2008); Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007); Fadiga v. Attorney General, 488 F.3d 142, 155 (3d Cir. 2007); Sene v. Gonzales, 453 F.3d 383, 386 (6th Cir. 2006); Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Tang, 354 F.3d at 1196; see also Nelson v. Boeing Co., AA6 F.3d 1118, 1120 (10th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he only context in which courts have recognized a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in civil litigation is in immigration cases.”).4 As noted, the Board has accepted these decisions as well. See Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 560; Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638.
 
In doing so, however, the Board did not consider several critical points. For one thing, the cases the Board has accepted as supporting a potential Fifth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings rest on a weak foundation. As several courts now recognize, the cases acknowledging a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings trace back to a pair of 1975 decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Barthold v. INS, 517 F.2d 689 (5th Cir. 1975), and Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194 (5th Cir. 1975), neither of which actually held that such a right exists. See Afanwi, 526 F.3d at 797. In fact, the Fifth Circuit explicitly stated in those cases that the “existence, let alone the nature and scope, of such a right has not been established,” and merely suggested in dictum that “any right an alien may have in this regard is grounded in the fifth amendment guarantee of due process rather than the sixth amendment right to counsel.” Barthold, 517 F.2d at 690 (emphasis added); *720 see also Paul, 521 F.2d at 197 (following Barthold).5 More important, the constitutional analysis in the cases that recognize a Fifth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings is, in the words of the Seventh Circuit “distinctly perfunctory,” Stroe, 256 F.3d at 500; see also Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 558 (“We … acknowledge some ambiguity in the basis set forth in [Lozada] for [aliens] to assert ineffective assistance claims.”), and fails to establish that lawyers privately retained to represent aliens in removal proceedings are state actors for purposes of the Due Process Clause. This is a fatal flaw because, as noted, it is indisputable that the Fifth Amendment applies only against the Government. See, e.g., San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc., 483 U.S. at 542-43; Mathews, 424 U.S. at 332. And as the Eighth Circuit recently observed, it is “difficult to see how an individual, such as an alien’s attorney, who is not a state actor, can deprive anyone of due process rights.” Rafiyev, 536 F.3d at 860-61.
 
**9 For private action to trigger scrutiny under the Due Process Clause, there must be a “sufficiently close nexus” between the Federal Government and the conduct of the private party “so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of” the Government itself. Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 351 (1974); accord Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004-05 (1982) (stating that “constitutional standards” may be invoked to challenge private action “only when it can be said that the [Government] is responsible for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains”); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982) (emphasizing that the Due Process Clause applies to a private actor only if he may “fairly be said to be a state actor”). That may be the case where the private actor “has exercised powers that are traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the [Government],” or where the Government “has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the [Government].” Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004-05 (internal quotation marks omitted). But “[t]he mere fact that a [private party] is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the [Government]” for purposes of the Due Process Clause. Id. at 1004 (internal quotation marks omitted). And “[m]ere approval of or acquiescence in the initiatives of a private party is not sufficient” either. Id. at 1004-05.
 
Applying these standards here, I agree with the courts that have concluded that the Government is not responsible for the conduct of a privately retained *721 lawyer in removal proceedings. See Rafiyev, 536 F.3d at 861; Afanwi, 526 F.3d at 798-99; Magala, 434 F.3d at 525. A private lawyer plainly does not exercise “powers that are traditionally the exclusive prerogative” of the Government because the lawyer is an adversary of the Government. Cf. Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 531 U.S. 288, 304 (2001) (“The state-action doctrine does not convert opponents into virtual agents.”); Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 317-24 (1981) (holding that adversaries of the state are not state actors for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983). Nor, in the ordinary case, can it be said that a private lawyer’s deficient performance in representing an alien in removal proceedings is the product either of Government “coerci[on]” or “encouragement.” Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004-05; see, e.g., Afanwi, 526 F.3d at 799 (“Afanwi’s counsel was privately retained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1362, and his alleged ineffectiveness … was a purely private act. The federal government was under no obligation to provide Afanwi with legal representation, and there was no connection between the federal government and counsel’s failure.”) (footnote omitted).
 
**10 It is true that, as respondents and their amici assert, the Federal Government has taken affirmative steps to notify aliens of the availability of counsel, see, e.g., 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(a)(l)-(3) (2008), and to regulate the private immigration bar, see, e.g., id. §§ 1003.101(a)(l)-(4), 1003.102(k), 1292.1(a)(l)-(6), 1292.2(a), (c), (d), 1292.3(a). But as noted, the “mere fact that a [private party] is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the [Government]” for purposes of the Due Process Clause. Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, for the constitutional standards to apply, the Government must be responsible for “the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.” Id. (emphasis added). It cannot accurately be said that the Government’s steps to encourage competent representation and to improve the quality of counsel as a general matter are “responsible” for a specific lawyer’s incompetent performance. Cf. Lawrence v. Florida, 547 U.S. 327, 337 (2007) ( “[A] State’s effort to assist prisoners in postconviction proceedings does not make the State accountable for a prisoner’s delay.”). The relevant regulatory provisions do not condone poor representation, much less constitute “significant encouragement” of, Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004, or “willful participa[tion] in,” Lugar, 457 U.S. at 941 (internal quotation marks omitted), incompetent performance. These basic and well-established principles, which the Board did not consider in either Lozada or Assaad, have moved several courts to hold that private lawyers in immigration proceedings are not state actors for due process purposes. See Rafiyev, 536 F.3d at 861; Afanwi, 526 F.3d at 798-99; Magala, 434 F.3d at 525.
 
*722 In arguing that a private lawyer’s representation of an alien in a removal proceeding may nonetheless constitute state action, respondents and their amici rely heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision in Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 (1980). See, e.g., Brief for American Immigration Law Foundation as Amicus Curiae at 11-12, 15, 17; Brief for Joseph Afanwi as Amicus Curiae at 3, 6, 10, 12. But that reliance is misplaced. In Cuyler, the Court held that a criminal defendant may challenge the effectiveness of his trial lawyer even if that lawyer was privately retained. See 446 U.S. at 342-45. A reading of the Court’s decision, however, makes plain that its holding was merely an application of the underlying Sixth Amendment right to counsel in criminal cases (and the equal justice principles that make that right applicable to the actions of both Government-appointed and privately retained lawyers). As the Court explained:
**11 Our decisions make clear that inadequate assistance does not satisfy the Sixth Amendment right to counsel …. [T]he Sixth Amendment does more than require the States to appoint counsel for indigent defendants. The [Sixth Amendment] right to counsel prevents the States from conducting trials at which persons who face incarceration must defend themselves without adequate legal assistance. A proper respect for the Sixth Amendment disarms [the] contention that defendants who retain their own lawyers are entitled to less protection than defendants for whom the State appoints counsel. … The vital guarantee of the Sixth Amendment would stand for little if the often uninformed decision to retain a particular lawyer could reduce or forfeit the defendant’s entitlement to constitutional protection.
 
Id. at 344 (emphasis added). As the repeated references in this passage to the Sixth Amendment make clear, the Court’s ruling was grounded in the Sixth Amendment and its explicit guarantee of a right to counsel, including Government-appointed counsel, which are inapplicable here. That is, the Court recognized a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel by privately retained lawyers in criminal proceedings because: (1) the Constitution itself, through the Sixth Amendment, guarantees a right to counsel in such proceedings (whether the defendant is “indigent” or able to hire lawyers); (2) to be meaningful, this right must refer to “adequate” (or effective) assistance of counsel; and (3) in light of principles of equal justice, the right must apply to all criminal defendants, whether they hire private lawyers with their own funds or have a Government-appointed lawyer. Thus, where, as here, there is no constitutional right to counsel that includes the right to Government-appointed counsel, the holding in Cuyler does not apply. See, e.g., Stroe, 256 F.3d at 501 (“In criminal cases … the Sixth Amendment is interpreted to impute even a retained lawyer’s goof-ups to the state, Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 342-45 (1980)—but then the Sixth Amendment creates a right to counsel, whereas all that the due process clause requires, so far as procedure is concerned, is notice and an opportunity for a hearing.”).
 
*723 Were there any doubt on this score, it is resolved by the Supreme Court’s decisions in Wainright v. Torna, 455 U.S. 586 (1982) (per curiam), and Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991). In Wainwright, the Court considered whether the respondent, a criminal defendant, could challenge his lawyer’s failure to file timely a discretionary appeal to the State supreme court. Noting that “a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to counsel to pursue discretionary state appeals,” 455 U.S. at 587 (citing Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600 (1974)), the Court quickly disposed of the respondent’s claim. “Since respondent had no constitutional right to counsel,” the Court explained, “he could not be deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his retained counsel’s failure to file the application timely.” Id. at 587-88. In reaching this conclusion, the Court explicitly addressed the due process and state action issues relevant here, explaining that the respondent “was not denied due process of law by the fact that counsel deprived him of his right to petition” the State supreme court for review because “[s]uch deprivation … was caused by his counsel, and not by the State.” Id. at 588 n.4.
 
**12 The Court applied the same analysis in Coleman. In that case, the petitioner, a criminal defendant, had been convicted and sentenced to death. On State habeas review, he raised various Federal constitutional claims, but the State supreme court refused to address them because his lawyer had filed an untimely notice of appeal. Normally, such “procedural default” would bar review of the claims on Federal habeas review, but the petitioner argued that his lawyer’s error should excuse the default. As in Wainwright, the Court rejected this argument swiftly: “There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings. Consequently, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings. See Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U.S. 586 (1982) (where there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance).” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 752 (some citations omitted). The Court further explained that because the petitioner’s lawyer was “the petitioner’s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, … the petitioner must ‘bear the risk of attorney error.”’ Id. at 753 (quoting Murray v. Carrier, All U.S. 478, 488 (1986); and citing Link, 370 U.S. at 634, and Irwin, 498 U.S. at 92).
 
The Court acknowledged that a different rule applied where, as in Cuyler, a lawyer’s conduct had deprived his client of the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel. The Court explained, however, that “[t]his is not because … the error is so bad that ‘the lawyer ceases to be an agent of the petitioner.”’ Coleman, 501 U.S. at 754 (quoting petitioner’s brief). Rather, “if the procedural default is the result of [constitutional] ineffective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment itself requires that responsibility for the default *724 be imputed to the State.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). “In other words,” wrote the Court, “it is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor, i.e., ‘imputed to the State.”’ Id. Where a criminal defendant has been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, the Court continued, “the State, which is responsible for the denial as a constitutional matter, must bear the cost…. A different allocation of costs is appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure that the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.” Id.; cf. Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 337 (holding that a lawyer’s filing errors do not entitle a party to equitable tolling in a “context where [the party] ha[s] no constitutional right to counsel”).
 
**13 Respondents and their amici attempt to distinguish Wainwright and Coleman on the grounds that those cases implicated federalism concerns that are not present here and involved discretionary state appeals rather than first appeals as of right. See, e.g., Brief for American Immigration Law Foundation as Amicus Curiae at 16-18; Brief for Joseph Afanwi as Amicus Curiae at 11-12. But to the extent relevant here, nothing in the Court’s decisions turned on these considerations. (Indeed, Wainwright did not even discuss federalism.) See Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 565-66 (Scialabba, Chairman, and Filppu, Board Member, concurring). Respondents and their amici also contend that Wainwright and Coleman should not guide the constitutional inquiry here because they concerned criminal, rather than immigration, matters. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent J-E-C- at 9-11; Brief for American Immigration Law Foundation as Amicus Curiae at 19-20; Brief for Joseph Afanwi as Amicus Curiae at 11-12; see also Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 560 (majority opinion) (stating, in adhering to Lozada, that Wainwright and Coleman “arose in the context of criminal, rather than immigration, proceedings” and thus did not control over circuit precedent issued in the immigration context). But Coleman involved State habeas review, which—like a removal proceeding—is civil in nature. Moreover, if anything, that Wainwright and Coleman related to criminal cases actually cuts against the arguments presented by respondents and their amici because criminal defendants enjoy an express constitutional right to assistance of counsel, including Government-appointed counsel, while aliens in removal proceedings do not.
 
In the final analysis, respondents’ and their amici’s arguments boil down to an assertion that, notwithstanding all of the foregoing Supreme Court precedent and settled constitutional law, an alien’s general due process right to a full and fair hearing on the merits of his immigration claims must include a specific right to effective assistance of counsel because without such a specific right removal proceedings would be fundamentally unfair. In *725 particular, respondents and their amici contend that because the stakes in removal proceedings are so high, the immigration laws are so complex, and aliens are so often ill equipped—due to cultural, educational, financial, or language barriers—successfully to handle them alone, due process requires the guiding hand of competent counsel. See, e.g., Brief for the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law as Amicus Curiae at 2-4; Brief for Respondent Bangaly at 9-10 (arguing for a fundamentally fair proceeding); Brief for Respondent J-E-C- at 12 (same); see also, e.g., Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014, 1017-18 (9th Cir. 2008); Hernandez-Gil v. Gonzales, A16 F.3d 803, 806-07 (9th Cir. 2007). This argument is insufficient to override the relevant constitutional holdings of Wainwright and Coleman, which had nothing to do with the complexity of the issues involved or the wealth and sophistication of the litigants. Nor can the arguments convert otherwise private actors into state actors, which, as discussed, is the prerequisite for a Due Process Clause claim.
 
**14 Moreover, respondents’ and their amici’s argument regarding the special nature of removal proceedings ignores key implications of the constitutional right they assert. If respondents and their amici are correct that a Fifth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel flows from a litigant’s relative disadvantage in certain civil proceedings, the Constitution would arguably require not just effective assistance by privately retained lawyers in removal proceedings, but also assistance of counsel—including Government-appointed counsel—in removal proceedings. Yet no court has ever held that such a right exists in removal proceedings. Nor has any court ever suggested that where an alien represents himself in his removal proceedings (as often happens), he has a constitutional right to seek or obtain reopening of the proceedings on the ground that his own performance was incompetent. This fact is revealing, because as the Supreme Court has explained in the Sixth Amendment context, there are serious equal protection concerns with construing the Constitution to confer greater rights on an alien who chose to avail himself of the privilege to retain counsel than on an alien who did not do so or who could not do so because he was indigent. See Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 344.
 
In addition, if correct, respondents’ and their amici’s Fifth Amendment argument would apply with equal, if not greater, force to many other forms of civil proceedings. Yet courts have repeatedly and expressly held that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in other civil contexts where the stakes are as high (or higher) than in removal proceedings and where litigants suffer from the same alleged disadvantages as aliens. As Judge Easterbrook explained in a recent Seventh Circuit opinion, “The Constitution entitles aliens to due process of law, but this does not imply a right to good lawyering. Every litigant in every suit and every administrative proceeding is *726 entitled to due process, but it has long been understood that lawyers’ mistakes are imputed to their clients.” Magala, 434 F.3d at 525 (citing cases); see also Stroe, 256 F.3d at 500.
 
In sum, and as a number of courts have now recognized, there is no valid basis for finding a constitutional right to counsel in removal proceedings, and thus no valid basis for recognizing a constitutional right to effective assistance of privately retained lawyers in such proceedings. The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in criminal cases does not apply because removal proceedings are civil. And the Fifth Amendment does not confer an equivalent right because the Due Process Clause applies only against the Government, aliens have no constitutional right to Government-appointed lawyers in removal proceedings, and there is no other ground for treating private lawyers as state actors. Accordingly, the Government is not “responsible” for the denial of effective representation in removal proceedings “as a constitutional matter.” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 754; see also, e.g.,Rafiyev, 536 F.3d at 860-61 (concluding that because “[c]onstitutional rights are rights against the government” and it is “difficult to see how an individual, such as an alien’s attorney, who is not a state actor, can deprive anyone of due process rights,” there “is no constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment to effective assistance of counsel in a removal proceeding”).
 
**15 The fact that aliens in removal proceedings have a statutory privilege to retain counsel of their choosing at no expense to the Government, see sections 240(b)(4) and 292 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4) & 1362, does not change the constitutional analysis, because a statutory privilege is not the same as a right to assistance of counsel, including Government-appointed counsel, under the Constitution. See Finley, 481 U.S. at 556 (“[T]he fact that the defendant has been afforded assistance of counsel [under state law] does not end the inquiry for Federal constitutional purposes. Rather, it is the source of that right to a lawyer’s assistance, combined with the nature of the proceedings, that controls the constitutional question. In this case, respondent’s access to a lawyer is the result of the State’s decision, not the command of the United States Constitution.”). Under Finley, Wainwright and Coleman, it is the presence or absence of a constitutional (as opposed to statutory or other) right to counsel, including Government-appointed counsel, that controls whether there is a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. See Rafiyev, 536 F.3d at 861 (“Removal proceedings are civil; there is no constitutional right to an attorney, so an alien cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.”) (citing Wainwright, Coleman and other cases). Because the Constitution does not confer a right to counsel (including Government-appointed counsel) in removal proceedings, I conclude, as have a growing number of Federal courts of appeals, that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in such proceedings.
 
*727 To the extent they are inconsistent with this conclusion, Lozada and Assaad (and any other Board precedent decisions on point) are overruled.
  
III.
 
Having concluded that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings, I consider whether a non-constitutional source of law—either the immigration statutes or departmental regulations—entitle an alien to reopen his removal proceedings based on his lawyer’s deficient performance. They do not. The Act and its implementing regulations merely permit an alien to hire “such counsel” as “he shall choose,” section 292 of the Act; accord section 240(b)(4)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.16(b) (2008); they give an alien “no right to complain,” much less reopen his proceedings, “if the lawyer he hires is ineffective.” Stroe, 256 F.3d at 500; see also Jezierski v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 886, 888 (7th Cir. 2008) (“No statute entitles the alien to effective assistance of counsel.”); cf. Father & Sons Lumber and Bldg. Supplies, Inc. v. NLRB, 931 F.2d 1093, 1097 (6th Cir. 1991) (holding that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) (1988), which provides that a “person compelled to appear in person before an agency … is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel,” does not “confer a statutory right to effective assistance of counsel”). Accordingly, neither the Constitution nor any statutory or regulatory provision entitles an alien to a do-over if his initial removal proceeding is prejudiced by the mistakes of a privately retained lawyer.
 
**16 That said, the Department of Justice is “not limited to the very least that the Constitution”—or the Act—“demands.” Magala, 434 F.3d at 526. Although the law does not require the Department to provide an alien with the right to reopen his removal proceedings based on lawyer error, the law allows the Department to do so “as a matter of sound discretion.” Id. The source for this authority is the Department’s broad authority to reopen removal proceedings. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act (permitting a motion to reopen within 90 days of the date on which a final administrative order of removal is entered); section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act (granting an alien 180 days to seek reopening in order to rescind a removal order entered in absentia; and providing no time limit where the alien did not receive notice of the immigration hearing or was in custody); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (2008). The Act and its implementing regulations place a few limits on the Board’s discretion in determining whether reopening is warranted, see, e.g., section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act (providing that a motion to reopen must state “the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (2008) (“A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence *728 sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing ….”), but the Board generally enjoys “broad discretion” in ruling on motions to reopen, and may deny reopening even where an alien has made a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); accord INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 105-06 (1988); INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 449 (1985); Matter of Coelho. 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (1992); cf. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte is limited to “exceptional” circumstances and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).6
 
Reopening removal proceedings on the basis of a lawyer’s deficient performance is a permissible exercise of this broad discretion. It is also a proper exercise of that discretion in appropriate circumstances—namely, if certain prerequisites, explained below, are met—because the stakes in removal proceedings are sometimes high, the immigration laws can be complex, and many aliens would be better equipped to navigate them with counsel. See, e.g., Aris, 517 F.3d at 600; Hernandez-Gil, 476 F.3d at 806-07. Moreover, and regrettably, “[t]he deficiencies of the immigration bar are well known.” Stroe, 256 F.3d at 504; see also, e.g., Aris, 517 F.3d at 596, 600-01 (“With disturbing frequency, this Court encounters evidence of ineffective representation by attorneys retained by immigrants seeking legal status in this country.”). There is a strong public interest in ensuring that these deficiencies do not affirmatively undermine the fairness and accuracy of removal proceedings. Cf. Final Rule: Professional Conduct for Practitioners— Rules and Procedures, 65 Fed. Reg. 39, 513, 39, 514-15 (June 27, 2000) (recognizing that an effective disciplinary system protects the public, preserves the integrity of the immigration courts, and helps maintain high professional standards); Final Rule: Professional Conduct for Practitioners— Rules and Procedures, and Representation and Appearances, 73 Fed. Reg. 76, 914, 76, 915 (Dec. 18, 2008) (defining “additional categories of behavior that constitute misconduct” by attorneys and accredited representatives in order to “preserve the fairness and integrity of immigration proceedings, and increase the level of protection afforded to aliens in those proceedings”). That interest justifies allowing the Board to mitigate the consequences of a lawyer’s deficient performance by allowing an alien to relitigate his removal in the extraordinary case where his *729 lawyer’s deficient performance likely changed the outcome of his initial removal proceedings.7
 
**17 At the same time, it is important to recognize that there is a strong public interest in the expeditiousness and finality of removal proceedings, an interest that Congress has repeatedly emphasized through legislation imposing time limits and curbing discretionary relief. See, e.g., Liadov v. Mukasey, 518 F.3d 1003, 1009-10 (8th Cir. 2008) (“Congress in recent years has taken repeated action to expedite removal proceedings and curb perceived abuses.”). As the Supreme Court has observed, granting motions to reopen “too freely” would undermine this interest by “permit[ting] endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case.” Abudu, 485 U.S. at 108 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323 (stating that motions to reopen are “especially” disfavored “in a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States”); Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147, 150 (1st Cir. 2004) (“Since a delay in deportation may itself constitute a substantial boon to an alien already subject to a final deportation order, there exists a significant prospect that entirely meritless and/or collusive ineffective assistance claims may be filed for purely dilatory purposes.”). This concern is especially strong when an alien seeks reopening *730 on the basis of a lawyer’s alleged deficient performance, because even a meritless motion can succeed in tying up the system and postponing an alien’s removal for months or even years based on the difficulties inherent in assessing and adjudicating a lawyer’s performance after the fact. Federal courts have observed that they are increasingly burdened by claims of lawyer error and have condemned “the numerous groundless and dilatory claims” of this sort that are “routinely submitted” to immigration judges and the Board. Betouche, 357 F.3d at 150.
 
The balancing of these competing considerations in addressing motions to reopen under the Act is committed to the discretion of the Attorney General. See Abudu, 485 U.S. at 108, 110. I exercise that discretion in this opinion by identifying the general criteria to be used by the Board and immigration judges in addressing motions to reopen based on claims of deficient performance by counsel. At the same time, the Board and immigration judges retain considerable discretion in addressing such motions. Whether an alien has made a sufficient showing to warrant relief based on counsel’s allegedly deficient performance is, in each case, committed to the discretion of the Board or the immigration judge. And the Board and immigration judges retain discretion to deny relief in appropriate circumstances even if the prerequisites described below are satisfied, especially where the ultimate relief sought is discretionary.
  
IV.
 
**18 With these competing interests in mind, I turn to the general framework that the Board and immigration judges should apply henceforth when aliens seek to reopen removal proceedings based on a lawyer’s deficient performance. To avoid confusion with what has heretofore been treated as a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, I will refer to the claim recognized in this opinion as a “deficient performance of counsel” claim.8
 
*731 In establishing a framework for consideration of deficient performance claims, I do not write on a blank slate. As noted, 20 years ago, in Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, the Board held (albeit based on erroneous constitutional underpinnings) that an alien may qualify for reopening of his removal proceedings based on lawyer error. To qualify for relief, the Board explained, an alien must establish that his lawyer’s failings had been “egregious,” and that he had been prejudiced by his lawyer’s performance. Id. at 638-39. In addition, the Board established three requirements, the so-called Lozada factors, for reopening removal proceedings on grounds of lawyer error. First, the alien must submit an affidavit “attesting to the relevant facts,” including “a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken [in the litigation] and what counsel did or did not represent to the [alien] in this regard.” Id. at 639. Second, “former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond,” and that response, if any, must accompany the motion. Id. And third, “the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Id.
 
The Lozada standards and requirements have largely stood the test of time, but 20 years of experience has also revealed ways in which they can and should be improved. The administrative framework established today supersedes that set forth in Lozada, but draws on its approach. Significantly, it is designed, as the framework in Lozada was, to enable the Board to resolve most deficient performance claims on the basis of the written record presented by the parties in connection with the motion without having to remand to an immigration judge for fact-finding. See Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 829, 831-32 (7th Cir. 2007) (noting that the Lozada factors were designed to “reduce the potential for abuse by providing information from which the [Board] can assess whether an ineffective assistance claim has enough substance to warrant the time and resources necessary to resolve the claim on its merits”). Evidentiary hearings before an immigration judge cannot always be avoided, but “such hearings are an added burden on both the parties and the Immigration Court, and they rarely assist in resolving the merits of the substantive immigration law issues presented by a particular case.” Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996). Consequently, the framework established today is intended, as Lozada was, to permit the Board to resolve the great majority of claims expeditiously on the basis of an alien’s motion to reopen and accompanying documents alone. See id. (noting that the Board “prefer[s] to make final determinations of ineffective assistance of counsel claims on the documentary submissions alone, where possible”); see also Betouche, 357 F.3d at 150 (“The immigration courts, which reasonably cannot be expected to conduct a full-fledged evidentiary hearing for all such claims, *732 must be able to impose fair and efficacious techniques for screening out, ab initio, the numerous groundless and dilatory claims routinely submitted in these cases.”).
 
**19 A.
 
To prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim, an alien bears the burden of establishing three elements.
 
First, the alien must show that his lawyer’s failings were “egregious,” a requirement the Board recognized in Lozada. See 19 I&N Dec. at 639. In light of the strong public interest in finality and the rule that “litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys,” id., it is not enough merely to demonstrate that one’s lawyer made an ordinary mistake or could have presented a more compelling case. Moreover, given the danger of second guessing a lawyer’s performance with “the distorting effects of hindsight,” it is appropriate in making this assessment to apply a “strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. Requiring that the error be “egregious,” and viewing the matter from counsel’s perspective at the time, will help ensure that reopening is reserved for those extraordinary cases that truly warrant relief, and that relief is not granted simply because an alien shows after the fact that he received less than flawless representation.
  
2.
 
Second, in cases where the alien moves to reopen beyond the applicable time limit—typically 90 days from the date the removal order was entered—the Board may exercise its discretion to allow tolling of the 90-day period, but only if the alien affirmatively shows that he exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to cure his lawyer’s alleged deficient performance. Cf., e.g., Barry v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 721, 724-25 (6th Cir. 2008) (holding that the reopening deadline may be equitably tolled in cases involving a lawyer’s deficient performance, provided that the alien shows due diligence); Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2006) (same). “Due diligence requires an alien to prove that the delay in filing the motion to reopen was due to an exceptional circumstance beyond his control.” Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417, 423 (6th Cir. 2007) (quotation marks omitted). In deficient performance cases, this will typically require that the alien prove he made timely inquiries about his immigration status and the progress of his case. It *733 will also typically require that the alien promptly file a motion to reopen within a reasonable period after discovering his lawyer’s deficient performance.
 
There is no bright line for determining when a particular delay is too long. Instead, the Board should evaluate due diligence on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the circumstances of the case and the reasons offered for any delay. The Board should perform this evaluation by determining objectively when a reasonable person should have discovered the possibility that he had been victimized by the lawyer’s deficient performance, and when a reasonable person would have taken steps to cure it following discovery. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000) (stating that the test is whether the lawyer’s error was, “or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation”); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006) (asking “whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would have been aware of the possibility that he had suffered an injury”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The determination of whether the facts and circumstances warrant tolling of the filing period is—like the decision on a motion to reopen based on counsel’s allegedly deficient performance itself— committed in all instances to the discretion of the Board.
  
3.
 
**20 Third, as the Board and courts of appeals uniformly have held, an alien must establish prejudice arising from the lawyer’s errors. See Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638; cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691 (“An error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.”).
 
The proper standard of prejudice to apply, however, is a crucial question on which even the courts of appeals that have recognized a constitutionally based claim of ineffective assistance have not spoken consistently. Some courts apply a strict standard. See, e.g., Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 864 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that an alien “must establish that, but for the ineffective assistance of counsel, he would have been entitled to continue residing in the United States”). Other courts apply a standard similar to the one the Supreme Court established in Strickland for Sixth Amendment ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, namely “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s professional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” See, e.g., Fadiga, 488 F.3d at 159. And one court—the Ninth Circuit—deems the prejudice requirement satisfied as long as the alien can show “plausible grounds for relief” on the underlying claim. Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 794 (9th Cir. 2005).
 
I conclude that to establish prejudice arising from a lawyer’s deficient performance sufficient to permit reopening, an alien must show that but for the *734 deficient performance, it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking. In doing so, I borrow from the standard commonly applied by the Federal courts, in both civil and criminal proceedings, to motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. See, e.g., Environmental Barrier Co., LLC v. Slurry Sys., Inc., 540 F.3d 598, 608 (7th Cir. 2008); United States v. Johnson, 519 F.3d 478, 487 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The Supreme Court itself has described such motions as “the appropriate analogy” to motions to reopen removal proceedings. Abudu, 485 U.S. at 110; accord Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323. And as the Court explained, “[t]he reasons why motions to reopen are disfavored in deportation proceedings are comparable to those that apply to … motions for new trials on the basis of newly discovered evidence. There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases.” Abudu, 485 U.S. at 107 (footnote omitted).
 
**21 In my judgment, the “more likely than not” standard is more appropriate than Strickland‘s, “reasonable probability” standard. See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995) (recognizing that a “more likely than not” standard is more demanding than a “reasonable probability” standard). The Strickland standard, after all, was intended to vindicate a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Here, as discussed, there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, so the alien’s interests relative to the public interest in finality are correspondingly weaker. It follows that the “more likely than not” standard is also more appropriate than the Ninth Circuit’s “plausible grounds for relief” standard. Indeed, even Strickland rejected a comparable standard, explaining that “[v]irtually every act or omission of counsel would meet that test, and not every error that conceivably could have influenced the outcome undermines the reliability of the result of the proceeding.” 466 U.S. at 693. In short, the “more likely than not” standard best reflects and protects the strong public interest in ensuring the finality of removal proceedings while still providing a safety valve for those cases in which an alien was demonstrably harmed by his lawyer’s egregious performance.
 
As noted, this standard of prejudice requires the alien to establish the probability that, but for his lawyer’s error, he would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking. In most cases, this will require a showing that, but for the lawyer’s error, the alien likely would have been entitled to continue residing in the United States. Hence, an alien cannot prevail on a claim that, for example, his lawyer was wrong in failing to request a continuance simply by showing that he likely would have been granted a continuance. Instead, he must show that, but for the lawyer’s failing, he likely would have succeeded on the merits of his underlying claim to remain in the United States. And in *735 cases where discretionary relief is at issue, an alien must present evidence that not only establishes he was eligible for relief, but also that he believes would have led to a favorable exercise of discretion.
 
This is a common-sense requirement: If the alien would have been denied discretionary relief had the merits been adjudicated, there can have been no prejudice arising from an error that led to the agency’s failure to reach the merits. Moreover, because an alien who seeks only discretionary relief is removable, and because the request to reopen is itself discretionary, the Board may properly insist upon a clear showing that discretionary relief would have been granted if the merits had been adjudicated. This also will enable the Board to address some claims of lawyer error more efficiently, because it “may leap ahead, as it were, over the … threshold concerns … and simply determine that even if they were met, the movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.” Abudu, 485 U.S. at 105.9
  
B.
 
**22 To enable the Board to determine if these standards have been met, an alien who seeks reopening of removal proceedings based on his lawyer’s deficient performance also must submit certain documents in support of his motion. In particular, he must submit a detailed affidavit setting forth the facts that form the basis of the deficient performance of counsel claim. The affidavit must explain with specificity what his lawyer did or did not do, and why he, the alien, was harmed as a result. As the First Circuit has explained, “the requirement of a sworn affidavit, presaging and memorializing the testimony which the alien petitioner would present were he to be accorded a hearing, produces the primary evidentiary basis upon which the [agency] evaluates the bona fides of the petitioner’s claim in determining whether a hearing is even warranted.” Betouche, 357 F.3d at 150. Moreover, “by exposing an alien to the potential pains of perjury, the affidavit requirement foster[s] an atmosphere of solemnity commensurate with the gravity of the … claim, and serves as a screening device whereby deportable aliens are discouraged from filing dilatory ineffective assistance claims.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
In addition to the alien’s affidavit, the alien must attach five documents or sets of documents to his motion. If any of these documents is unavailable, the alien must explain why. If any of these documents is missing rather than nonexistent, the alien must summarize the document’s contents in his affidavit.
  
*736 1.
 
First, the alien must attach a copy of his agreement, if any, with the lawyer whose performance he alleges was deficient. Where there was no written agreement, the alien must specify in his affidavit what the lawyer had agreed to do, including whether it included the particular step in the proceedings in which the deficient performance is alleged to have occurred. This requirement will enable the Board to determine whether the alleged error was actually within the scope of the lawyer’s representation. After all, the mere fact that a lawyer failed to do something—for example, file a petition for review—does not, by itself, establish that the lawyer’s conduct was deficient, because the alien may not have retained the lawyer for that purpose. See Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639 (noting that the alien “has not alleged, let alone established, that former counsel ever agreed to prepare a brief on appeal or was engaged to undertake the task”); see also, e.g., Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that the petitioner’s motion to reopen had a “fatal flaw” in that it “makes no mention of the nature, scope, or substance of the petitioner’s arrangement with [his lawyer], nor does it indicate what communications the petitioner had with the attorney over the years”).
  
2.
 
**23 Second, the alien must attach both a copy of a letter to his former lawyer setting forth the lawyer’s deficient performance and a copy of the lawyer’s response, if any. (If the alien never received a response from his former lawyer, his affidavit must note the date on which he mailed his letter and state whether he made any other efforts to notify the lawyer.) The letter from the alien must suffice to put the lawyer on notice that the alien intends to file a deficient performance claim and to inform the lawyer of the facts that the alien alleges in support of the claim. This requirement gives the former lawyer—whose professional competence is being questioned—an opportunity to present his side of the story, and helps to ensure that the Board has the facts necessary to render an informed judgment. As the Board recognized in Lozada, this requirement also has the effect of “discouraging baseless accusations” because “the potential for abuse is apparent where no mechanism exists for allowing former counsel, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, to present his version of events if he so chooses.” 19 I&N Dec. at 639.
  
*737 3.
 
Third, the alien must attach a completed and signed complaint addressed to the appropriate State bar or disciplinary authorities.10 This requirement, like the preceding one, discourages baseless accusations and collusion, because it is one thing to file a motion that, even if denied, has the effect of delaying removal and another thing altogether to back that motion with the weight of a disciplinary complaint. See Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 556 (noting that the “bar complaint requirement acts as a protection against collusion between counsel and client to achieve delay in proceedings”). As the Board has explained, the requirement “increases our confidence in the validity of the particular claim, reduces the likelihood that an evidentiary hearing will be needed, and serves our long-term interests in monitoring the representation of aliens by the immigration bar.” Id.; cf. 65 Fed. Reg. at 39,514-15; 73 Fed. Reg. at 76,915.
 
It should be noted that, under this requirement, the alien need not actually file the complaint with the appropriate State bar or disciplinary authorities, as Lozada had required. By making the actual filing of a bar complaint a prerequisite for obtaining (or even seeking) relief, it appears that Lozada may inadvertently have contributed to the filing of many unfounded or even frivolous complaints. See, e.g., Comment filed by the Committee on Immigration & Nationality Law, Association of the Bar of the City of New York (Sept. 29, 2008), in response to the Proposed Rule for Professional Conduct for Practitioners—Rules and Procedures, and Representation and Appearances, 73 Fed. Reg. 44,178 (July 30, 2008) (“Under the Lozada Rule, an ineffective assistance of counsel charge is often required in order to reopen a case or reverse or remand an unfavorable decision. The practice of filing such claims is rampant, and places well-intentioned and competent attorneys at risk of discipline.”). Such unfounded complaints impose costs on well-intentioned and competent attorneys, and make it harder for State bars to identify meritorious complaints in order to impose sanctions on lawyers whose performance is truly deficient. The new approach is intended to avoid these problems by requiring only that the alien submit to the Board a completed and signed but unfiled complaint, and leaving it to the Board whether to refer the *738 complaint to the State bar or to the Executive Office for Immigration Review disciplinary counsel for further action.11
  
4.
 
**24 Fourth, if the alien’s claim is that his former lawyer failed to submit something to the immigration judge or to the Board, he must attach the allegedly omitted item to his motion. For example, if the alien’s claim is that his former lawyer failed to submit a brief to the Board, he must submit, in substance and detail if not in form, a copy of the brief that he alleges should have been filed. If the alien’s claim is that his former lawyer failed to introduce certain evidence or testimony, he must submit that evidence (directly in the case of physical or documentary evidence and through a witness’s affidavit in the case of testimony) to the Board. Moreover, the alien must explain in his affidavit whether he told his former lawyer about the evidence or testimony in question, and if not, why not.
 
Requiring aliens to submit such material to the Board will reduce delays and promote finality by ensuring that the Board can resolve most deficient performance claims without remanding for evidentiary hearings. In addition, requiring proof that an alien told his lawyer about evidence or testimony—or had a good reason for failing to do so—is common sense. After all, if an alien never shared the existence of certain evidence or testimony with his lawyer, it is difficult to fault the lawyer for failing to submit that evidence or testimony to the immigration judge.
  
5.
 
Fifth and finally, where an alien is represented by counsel in seeking reopening, the motion for reopening shall contain the following signed statement of the new attorney: “Having reviewed the record, I express a belief, based on a reasoned and studied professional judgment, that the performance of my client’s former counsel fell below minimal standards of professional competence.”12 This requirement—which is analogous to court of appeals *739 rules requiring lawyers to attest to the existence of circuit splits or to questions of exceptional importance in petitions for rehearing en banc, see, e.g., Third Circuit Rule 35.1 (2008); Federal Circuit Rule 35(b) (2008)— will further discourage meritless claims by serving as a reminder that challenges to the performance of another lawyer should not be made lightly.
  
C.
 
The legal standards set forth in Part IV. A and the evidentiary requirements set forth in Part IV.B are mandatory. That is, to be eligible for a favorable exercise of discretion based on a deficient performance claim, an alien must comply with all requirements that apply. Excusing an alien from compliance with a particular requirement, or deeming “substantial compliance” adequate (as several courts of appeals have done with respect to the Lozada factors, see, e.g., Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597-99 (9th Cir. 2004)), would hinder the development of a complete record, making it more difficult for the Government to respond and more difficult for the Board to adjudicate the case. It also would undermine the Board’s (and the bar’s) efforts to monitor the quality of representation before the immigration courts. Finally, excusing compliance in some cases would create uncertainty as to when a requirement will be enforced and when it will be waived. Of course, even if an alien complies with all applicable requirements, the Board is not compelled to reopen proceedings, as reopening ultimately is discretionary. See, e.g., Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323.
  
D.
 
**25 Finally, it bears noting that the Board’s discretion to reopen on the basis of a lawyer’s deficient performance is not limited to conduct that occurred during the agency proceedings. The Board may reopen on the basis of deficient performance that occurred subsequent to the entry of a final order of removal.13
 
*740 In reaching this conclusion, I recognize that, in reviewing claims under the Lozada framework, the Board has not spoken consistently on the question of when deficient performance must occur to permit reopening. See Afanwi, 526 F.3d at 795-96 (noting that the Board “has issued contradictory opinions on the subject” and citing cases). I recognize also that the courts of appeals have taken conflicting views. Compare Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1044 n.4 (9th Cir. 2000) (“A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel occurring after the [Board] has ruled may be raised with the [Board] by filing a motion to reopen.”), and Gjondrekaj v. Mukasey, 269 Fed. Appx. 106, 108 (2d Cir. 2008) (remanding where the alien’s lawyer missed the petition for review filing deadline, and holding that “to the extent the [Board] here concluded that it could not grant reopening or reissuance absent some error by the agency or ineffective assistance before the agency, it failed to apply the correct law”), with Afanwi, 526 F.3d at 795-96 (holding that the Board “does not have jurisdiction over an ineffective assistance claim arising out of an alien’s counsel’s failure to file a timely petition for review with the court of appeals”).
 
In my judgment, the better view, and the one I adopt today, is that the Board has jurisdiction to consider deficient performance claims even where they are predicated on lawyer conduct that occurred after a final order of removal has been entered. The Board has broad discretion to reopen removal proceedings, and nothing in the statute or the regulations limits the grounds for reopening to events that occurred before the agency or prior to the entry of the final administrative order of removal. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625, 627 (7th Cir. 2003) (explaining, in a case where the alien’s lawyer had missed the petition-for-review filing deadline, that “[t]he Board of Immigration Appeals … has authority to reopen and revise its decisions on account of new developments” and “nothing prevents the Board from entering a new removal order, which is subject to a fresh petition for review”). In holding otherwise, the Fourth Circuit in Afanwi relied on 8 C.F.R. § 1003. l(d)(3)(ii) to conclude that the Board’s jurisdiction is limited to “questions of law, discretion, and *741 judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges.” 526 F.3d at 795-96. But that regulation addresses only the scope and standard of review by the Board. It does not purport to restrict the Board’s jurisdiction or to limit the Board’s broad authority to reopen removal proceedings.
 
**26 Deficient performance claims based on conduct that occurred after entry of a final order of removal shall be evaluated under the standards set forth in this opinion for all deficient performance claims. Thus, an alien must comply with the filing requirements set forth in Part IV.B, and must establish, among other things, that, but for the deficient performance, it is more likely than not that he would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking, as provided in Part IV. A. It is beyond the scope of this opinion to identify all the situations in which reopening after entry of a final order of removal may be warranted. There are, however, some situations in which it clearly would be unwarranted, such as when the deficient performance claim involved the quality of a lawyer’s briefs or arguments before a court of appeals - that is, when the claim involved conduct in proceedings conducted well after the administrative order of removal became final, in a separate tribunal in a separate branch of government.
  
V.
 
Before evaluating the Board’s orders in the instant cases, it is necessary to address one final matter: how, if at all, the framework announced in this opinion should be applied to motions to reopen (including the three at issue here) that were filed prior to this opinion. The general rule is that an agency or court should apply the law in effect at the time that it renders its decision. See Bradley v. Richmond Sch. Bd., 416 U.S. 696, 716 (1974); see also Meghani v. INS, 236 F.3d 843, 846 (7th Cir. 2001). In light of that rule, the Board and immigration judges should apply the substantive standards set forth in Part IV.A above to motions to reopen based on a lawyer’s deficient performance, regardless of when such motions were filed. It would be unfair, however, to apply the new filing requirements set forth in Part IV.B to such motions, since aliens may have filed them in good faith reliance on Lozada. See Bradley, 416 U.S. at 720 (stating that changes in the law should not be applied to pending cases where those changes would result in the imposition of “new and unanticipated obligations” without adequate notice). Accordingly, I hold that the Board and immigration judges should apply the new filing requirements only with respect to motions filed after today; with *742 respect to motions filed prior to this opinion, they should continue to apply the Lozada factors.14
 
With respect to the instant cases, then, the substantive standards set forth in Part IV.A above apply, but the new filing requirements set forth in Part IV.B do not. Applying those rules, I affirm the Board’s decisions denying respondents’ motions to reopen.
 
**27 In Matter of Compean, respondent’s motion was without merit for three reasons. First, applying the substantive standards set forth in this opinion, respondent has failed to establish either that his former lawyer committed an “egregious” error or that he was prejudiced by any deficiencies in the lawyer’s conduct. As noted, respondent’s self-described “most important” claim was that his former lawyer had failed to submit his Form I-130 visa petition to the Immigration Judge, but that form was in fact part of the record. Thus, he has shown neither that his lawyer’s actions were egregious nor that, but for his lawyer’s performance, it is more likely than not that he would have established the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” required for cancellation of removal. Section 240A(b)(l)(D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(l)(D). The Board therefore properly denied respondent’s motion to reopen on the ground that he had failed to establish prejudice. Finally, as the Board noted, respondent failed to comply with Lozada’s requirement of filing a disciplinary complaint. Under Lozada, that alone warranted denial of his motion.
 
In Matter of Bangaly, respondent’s motion was properly denied on either of two grounds. First, under Lozada (as under the new requirements set forth in this opinion), respondent was required to give his former lawyer notice of his alleged deficiencies and a chance to respond. As discussed above, such notice is important because it discourages baseless claims and because it makes it more likely that the Board can address the motion without the need to remand for a hearing. Yet, as the Board found, respondent failed to show that he complied with this requirement. Second, respondent has failed to show prejudice under the standard announced in this opinion. His motion to reopen was premised on his former lawyer’s failure to file a brief with the Board appealing the Immigration Judge’s denial of an additional continuance. But neither here nor before the Board has respondent made any effort to show that, had his lawyer filed a brief, he likely would have obtained the continuance, let alone that he likely would have been permitted to remain in the United States.
 
In Matter of J-E-C-, unlike the other two cases, respondents appear to have complied with the Lozada factors. Nevertheless, respondents’ motion was  *743 properly denied for failure to establish prejudice. Among other things, the Board addressed the merits of each of the four points of error identified in respondents’ notice of appeal before it affirmed the Immigration Judge’s “thorough and well-reasoned decision.” (BIA Apr. 8, 2008). The Board also considered the brief submitted by respondents’ new lawyer and found it unpersuasive, thus “affirming … that the respondent[] did not suffer prejudice” from the failure of his former lawyer to file an appellate brief. Id. Under the standard of prejudice adopted in this opinion, the Board’s decision was correct.
  
CONCLUSION
 
**28 In sum, for the reasons stated above, I overrule Lozada and Assaad to the extent they are inconsistent with the constitutional conclusions in this opinion, and I affirm the Board’s decisions denying reopening in each of the matters before me.

My orders of August 7, 2008, called for submission of all briefs by September 15, 2008, and stated that “requests for extensions will be disfavored.” Following requests from a few parties and amici, however, I extended the briefing deadline for all briefs by 3 weeks, until October 6, 2008. See Att’y Gen. Order No. 2998-2008 (Sept. 8, 2008). Thus, in total, the parties and amid had 1 day shy of 2 full months to prepare their submissions, which is more time than that usually granted for briefing matters before the Board. See Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual ch. 4.7(a) and (c), at 65-67 (rev. July 30, 2004). I received more than a dozen amicus briefs from interested organizations and individuals.

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (enacted Sept. 30, 1996), established a new type of proceeding known as a “removal” proceeding to replace “deportation” proceedings.

3

The Supreme Court has recognized a due process right to Government-appointed counsel (and thus a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel) in certain civil proceedings that pose the same ultimate threat to a defendant’s physical liberty as a criminal trial that may result in incarceration. See Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 496-97 (1980) (plurality) (holding that an individual has a constitutional right to appointed counsel in a civil proceeding the outcome of which may result in physical confinement at a psychiatric institution); In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 36-41 (1967) (holding that a juvenile has a constitutional due process right to appointed counsel in a delinquency proceeding where he faces commitment to a juvenile-detention facility). But these cases involved the right to Government-appointed counsel, and the Supreme Court has largely limited these holdings to their particular contexts. See, e.g., Stroe, 256 F.3d at 500 (noting that Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1 (1989), and Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987), “seem … to have cut back on earlier cases according a Fifth Amendment right to counsel when physical liberty is at stake in a noncriminal proceeding”) (citing Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 31-32 (1981), and In re Gault, 387 U.S. at 36). And, in any event, the “pre-eminent generalization that emerges” from these cases is that the right to Government-appointed counsel “has been recognized to exist only where the litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.” Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 25 (emphasis added). Although an alien may be detained during the course of a removal proceeding, he does not “lose his physical liberty” based on the outcome of the proceeding. That is, the point of the proceeding is not to determine or provide the basis for incarceration or an equivalent deprivation of physical liberty, but rather to determine whether the alien is entitled to live freely in the United States or must be released elsewhere.

4

It is important to note that many of these courts have limited the right to effective assistance of counsel to proceedings in which an alien seeks non-discretionary relief, thus precluding constitutional ineffective assistance of counsel claims in proceedings seeking purely discretionary relief such as waiver or cancellation of removal, asylum, adjustment of status, or voluntary departure. See, e.g., Garcia v. Attorney General, 329 F.3d 1217, 1223-24 (11th Cir. 2003); Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696, 700 (6th Cir. 2001); Mejia-Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1148 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609-10 (5th Cir. 2006); Guerra-Soto v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 637, 640-41 (8th Cir. 2005); United States v. Torres, 383 F.3d 92, 104-05 (3d Cir. 2004). But see, e.g., Fernandez v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 592, 602 & n.8 (9th Cir. 2006); Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882-83 (2d Cir. 1994). These limitations flow from Supreme Court precedent holding that the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process applies to government proceedings only where a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property is at stake in those proceedings, see, e.g., Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 221 (2005), and that such interests are not implicated where proceedings involve only the pursuit of purely discretionary administrative relief, see, e.g., Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 464-67 (1981); Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 7-10 (1979).

5

In Assaad, the Board emphasized that the Fifth Circuit had “joined the other circuits that have found a basis in the Fifth Amendment for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.” 23 I&N Dec. at 558 (citing Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001)). But the Fifth Circuit itself has stated that it “has repeatedly assumed without deciding that an alien’s claim of ineffective assistance may implicate due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment.” Mai, 473 F.3d at 165 (emphasis added).

6

Although this opinion discusses the Board’s power to reopen, immigration judges also have the power to reopen removal proceedings based on a lawyer’s deficient performance, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23 (2008), and shall be guided by the same standards and procedures set forth herein when adjudicating such a motion. Likewise, the framework in this opinion applies to claims of deficient performance raised before the Board on direct review.

7

The interest in ensuring that a lawyer’s deficient performance does not undermine the fairness and accuracy of removal proceedings does not warrant, however, allowing a motion to reopen based on the conduct of non-lawyers (except where an alien is represented by an accredited representative pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1292.1(a)(4) or in the extraordinary case where an alien reasonably but erroneously believed that someone was a lawyer). The reason is that lawyers and accredited representatives are governed by rules of professional conduct and have skills, including but not limited to knowledge of immigration laws and procedures, that are directly related to furthering the interest that aliens and the Government have in fair and accurate immigration proceedings. See, e.g., Hernandez, 524 F.3d at 1018-19. The same cannot be said of non-lawyers, so-called “notarios” and other unaccredited immigration consultants. See, e.g., Mendoza-Mazariegos v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 1074, 1077 n.4 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he immigration system in this country is plagued with ‘notarios’ who prey on uneducated immigrants.”); see also Executive Office for Immigration Review Press Release, “Notarios,” Visa Consultants, and Immigration Consultants Are Not Attorneys (Nov. 20, 2008), available at <http:// www.usdoj.gov/eoir/press/08/NotariosNoticeProtectionsCAFINAL112008.p>. Accordingly, the deficient performance claim established in this opinion extends only to the conduct of a lawyer, an accredited representative, or a non-lawyer the alien reasonably but erroneously believed to be a lawyer and who was retained to represent the alien in the proceedings; it does not extend any further or to the conduct of an alien representing himself. Cf. Hernandez, 524 F.3d at 1018-19 (holding that an alien may not pursue an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim with respect to the conduct of a non-lawyer).

8

should apply the framework set forth below in toto, even in circuits that have previously held that there is a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. That will allow those circuits to reconsider the question (en banc if necessary) more efficiently and easily, without the weight of the Board’s 1988 Lozada precedent, which predated the majority of the relevant judicial decisions. If, notwithstanding my decision today, a court of appeals subsequently reaffirms (or decides in the first instance) that there is a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings, and that court’s decision has become final and unreviewable, the Board and immigration judges will need to determine what elements of the framework may be implemented in that circuit consistent with the court’s decision.

9

It bears mentioning that many of the Federal courts that have recognized constitutional claims to ineffective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings have not even permitted such claims where the relief sought is discretionary. See supra n. 4.

10

Where a deficient performance claim is based on the conduct of an accredited representative, see 8 C.F.R. § 1292.1(a)(4) (permitting aliens appearing before the Board to be represented by an accredited representative); cf. Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94 (BIA 2007) (holding that the Lozada framework applies to accredited representatives), the alien must instead attach a complaint addressed to the Executive Office for Immigration Review disciplinary counsel, because such accredited representatives are subject to disciplinary action under the Executive Office for Immigration Review’s professional conduct regulations.

11

Of course, nothing prevents an alien, should he choose to do so, from filing his complaint with the State bar and with the Board. Prior filing of a complaint with the State bar simply is not a requirement for the motion to reopen.

12

A lawyer may not bypass this requirement by preparing a motion to reopen for the alien and then having the alien file the motion pro se. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1001.1(i) (2008) (defining the term “practice” to mean “the act or acts of any person appearing in any case, either in person or through the preparation or filing of any brief or other document, paper, application, or petition on behalf of another person or client”) (emphasis added); id. § 1001.1(k) (defining the term “preparation, constituting practice,” to mean “the study of the facts of a case and the applicable laws, coupled with the giving of advice and auxiliary activities, including the incidental preparation of papers”) (emphasis added). I also note that this requirement to acknowledge the deficient performance of counsel in the prior proceedings is applicable even where the same attorney continues to represent the alien in seeking to reopen the proceedings based on his own prior deficient performance.

13

In cases involving claims of this sort, it is not uncommon for the alien to allege that his lawyer never notified him of the Board’s decision in his case. To ensure that aliens receive notice of decisions in their cases and to forestall unfounded allegations that they did not, I have directed the Executive Office for Immigration Review to begin sending courtesy copies of final Board decisions to the aliens themselves in addition to sending them to the aliens’ lawyers. The Executive Office for Immigration Review intends to do so beginning March 1, 2009. See Executive Office for Immigration Review Press Release, Board To Begin Providing Copy of Decision to Aliens Who Are Represented by Counsel (Dec. 19, 2008), available at <http:// www.usdoj.gov/eoir/press/08/BIAProvidesCourtesyCopy121908.pdf>. After that date, aliens will be presumed to have received personal notice of the Board’s decision (in addition to notice through counsel) if it was sent to the most recent address the alien provided to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d) (2008).

14

Given the potential delay between signing this opinion and its publication, it may be unreasonable to expect aliens to comply with the new filing requirements immediately. Accordingly, the Board and immigration judges may allow amendment of motions filed in the next few weeks to comply with the new filing requirements.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William P. Joyce, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On December 5, 2008, the respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, filed a second motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status based on a pending employment-based immigrant visa petition (Form I-140). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to this motion. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our decision.
 
Due to the circumstances presented in this case, and to resolve any issue regarding jurisdiction in this case, we will adjudicate the instant motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent has established his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(i). He has also demonstrated that his prior attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. John K. Dvorak and Ms. Susan E. Zak, who filed the respondent’s first motion to reopen, informed the respondent as late as February 5, 2008, that his appeal was pending before this Board. See Respondent’s Motion, Tab E. In fact, the respondent’s appeal was dismissed on December 14, 2006. Attorney Christopher Drinan, failed to inform the Immigration Judge or this Board that the respondent’s father adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident three weeks after the respondent’s May 27, 2005, removal hearing, and event that rendered the respondent statutorily eligible for a waiver under section 212(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(i). See Respondent’s Motion, Tabs B and E. The respondent has diligently pursued his case. Based on the foregoing, we will grant the respondent’s unopposed motion and remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to afford the respondent the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosemary Vega, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the December 3, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge which found the respondent had abandoned her claim for relief due to the failure to file any application for relief by the date ordered. The record reflects the respondent was advised at a master calendar hearing on October 16, 2007, to file any and all applications for relief from removal on or before November 30, 2007. In a December 3, 2007, decision, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had failed to file any applications for relief and had, accordingly, abandoned her claims. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The appeal is dismissed.
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent, through new counsel, filed amotion to reopen and remand alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel who failed to file the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). However, the respondent has failed to comply with all of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In particular, the respondent has submitted an affidavit, but the affidavit does not set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her former attorney regarding the actions to be taken and the representations made by her former attorney in that regard. Further, in the letter of response from the respondent’s former counsel, it was noted that the respondent had failed to bring needed documents to an appointment with counsel shortly before the deadline for filing the application for cancellation of removal. The respondent had also cancelled a follow-up appointment with her former counsel. The respondent did not dispute either of these assertions by her former counsel. Moreover, we note that the respondent acknowledges that she did not file a grievance with any state bar association as a result of her former attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance; nor has she provided a persuasive explanation for not having done so, as contemplated by Lozada, supra. Curiously, the respondent argues that, despite her assertion that her former attorney provided ineffective assistance, she decided not to file a complaint with the state bar because she believes her former attorney was and is a good attorney. We find this argument inconsistent with the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the motion to reopen and remand will be denied.
 
*2 A review of the record also reveals that the respondent’s former counsel filed an earlier motion to reopen in December 2007 that was forwarded to the Board from the Immigration Court. Respondent’s former counsel requested that the motion to reopen be treated by the Board as a motion to remand to allow the respondent to pursue her application for cancellation of removal. Inasmuch as we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent abandoned her claim for cancellation of removal, the motion to remand will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen and remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand to pursue an application for cancellation of removal is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fatma E. Marouf, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sandra J. Santos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; voluntary departure; suspension of deportation
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 2, 2008. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal convictions.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent entered the United States without inspection. On July 22, 1986, the respondent was convicted on a guilty plea of Possession for Sale of Heroin and Cocaine, and two counts of Sale of Heroin. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exh. 2. Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable for being in the United States without being admitted or paroled and found the respondent removable for having a controlled substance violation. See I.J. at 2-3.
 
At the hearing, the respondent, through counsel, requested a continuance to get the criminal convictions vacated. He also requested voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge asked the respondent whether the post-conviction motion had been filed, and counsel admitted that it had not. The Immigration Judge then noted that the plea agreement specifically warns of the potential immigration consequences of the plea. Then, without expressly addressing the requested continuance, the Immigration Judge addressed the respondent’s eligibility for relief.
 
The Immigration Judge concluded that, because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent was statutorily ineligible for all relief. The Immigration Judge specifically found him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, voluntary departure,¿FN1º and adjustment of status. See I.J. at 3-4.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance. While it is clear from the record of proceedings that the Immigration Judge did not entertain the motion because the respondent had not yet even filed the motion before the criminal court to vacate the conviction¿FN2º and because the plea agreement contained a warning of the immigration consequences, the Immigration Judge should have expressly denied the continuance, and explained the basis for doing so, in the decision.
 
*2 The respondent raises for the first time on appeal the issue of eligibility for suspension of deportation, under former section 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1).¿FN3º He argues that he is statutorily eligible for suspension of deportation pursuant to Lopez-Castellanos v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 848 (9th Cir. 2006). The law has defined drug trafficking convictions as aggravated felonies since 1988. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B); §§ 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B)(i); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) n.30; first enacted as section 7342 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181. However, because the respondent’s convictions occurred in 1986, we agree that the law was retroactively applied to him. On that basis, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to determine whether the respondent is eligible for suspension of deportation (or any other relief) under the criteria that existed at the time of his guilty plea, and whether he merits relief as a matter of discretion.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Immigration Judge is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.

Though the respondent complains that the issue of voluntary departure was not addressed, the Immigration Judge expressly pretermitted that relief. See I.J. at 3.

2

We also note that the respondent does not allege on appeal that such a motion was ever filed.

On appeal, the respondent alleges he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former counsel. However, the respondent has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Isabel A.N. Thomas, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 3, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal on June 2, 1998. Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) or (2). Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act; Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999). We will dismiss the appeal, for the respondent has not shown that he did not receive proper notice of his merits hearing.
 
When an alien fails to appear at removal proceedings for which notice of the hearing was served by mail, as in the instant case, an in absentia order may be entered where the alien has received, or can be charged with receiving, a Notice to Appear informing the alien of the statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address, pursuant to section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. See Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). The November 20, 1997, Notice to Appear was personally served on the respondent (Exh. 1).
 
The April 21, 1998, notice of hearing (NOH) reflects that it was sent by regular mail, in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) and 239(c) of the Act, to the respondent’s attorney at the address provided by the respondent in his Motion for Change of Venue (Exh. 2). Counsel appeared for the hearing.¿FN1º
 
The NOH also reflects that a copy was mailed to the respondent. The respondent maintains, however, that he did not receive the NOH. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at Tab 1. We recently held that when adjudicating a motion to rescind an in absentia order based upon a claim of non-receipt of a hearing notice sent by regular mail to the alien’s most recent address, we will consider all relevant evidence submitted to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery by regular, as opposed to certified, mail. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 673-74 (BIA 2008). In this case, we do note the pendency of an asylum claim before the Immigration Court, a fact that might suggest an incentive to appear for a hearing, provided the claim is true, However, we also note that the NOH was not returned as undeliverable; that the respondent’s affidavit states that the NOH “never appeared,” but he submitted no affidavit to that effect from his cousin, in whose home he was living at the time; and that the respondent failed to demonstrate due diligence but instead waited 10 years after the Immigration Court’s grant of his request for a change of venue before he sought the advice of counsel about the status of his proceedings. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at Tab 1. Considering all of these circumstances, we conclude that the respondent has not rebutted the presumption of delivery of the NOH by regular mail. See Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677, 679-80 (BIA 2008); Matter of M-R-A-, supra.
 
*2 Therefore, because the respondent received the statutory address obligations when he was served the Notice to Appear and the hearing notice was thereafter sent to respondent’s counsel at the address provided by him, and to respondent himself, we find that the respondent was properly ordered removed in absentia. See Matter of G-Y-R-, supra, at 187-88.
 
The respondent has failed to meet the statutory grounds for rescission of his order of removal under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act by showing that he did not receive notice of his hearing, and thus his motion to reopen was properly denied. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed

The respondent claims that (1) he never retained the services of Adrienne D. Edward, Esquire, the attorney to whom the NOH was sent, and (2) Ms. Edward never notified him of his scheduled hearings. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at Tab 1. However, the respondent has not raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Thelma O. Garcia, Esquire, his attorney filing the Motion for Change of Venue containing the request of a change of counsel (Exh. 2), which change of counsel was recognized by the Immigration Judge’s January 14, 1998, order granting the request to change venue. Nor has the respondent raised a claim of ineffective assistance against Ms. Edward for failing to notify him of the June 2, 1998, hearing. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge’s June 3, 2008, decision found that the record contained a Notice of Appearance by Ms. Edward, signed by the respondent. The Motion for Change of Venue (Exh. 2) stated that such a Notice of Appearance was attached. However, our review of the record does not reveal a Notice of Appearance. Yet regardless of whether a Notice of Appearance was filed, the respondent was free to mount a claim of ineffective assistance against Ms. Edward for her alleged failure to notify him of his hearing date. We further note that the Immigration Judge’s finding with regard to the Notice of Appearance is harmless error, given our conclusion infra that the NOH was also delivered to the respondent.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s September 16, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his August 30, 2007, removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.¿FN1º
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. As the Immigration Judge noted, he lacked jurisdiction because the respondent’s motion was not timely filed.¿FN2º See generally Abdi v. United States Attorney General, 430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that the motion to reopen period is “mandatory and jurisdictional,” and not subject to equitable tolling, even where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised); see also Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999) (concerning time limitation for motions to reopen in absentia orders). Nonetheless, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not demonstrate that the in absentia order of removal qualifies for rescission. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i) (mandating that the Board “will accept the determination of factual issues by an immigration judge … unless the determination is clearly erroneous”). Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, an order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed (a) within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, or (b) at any time if the alien demonstrates he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed well after 180 days, almost a year, after the date of the order of removal and, in any event, establishes no exceptional circumstances that would excuse the respondent’s failure to appear. Contrary to the respondent’s apparent assertion on appeal, whether exceptional circumstances existed 1 year earlier does not assist the respondent in demonstrating that his untimely motion qualifies for rescission. Furthermore, as the Immigration Judge noted, notice of the respondent’s August 30, 2007, hearing that was scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m., was sent to the respondent’s last known address, which was provided by the respondent’s wife, whom the respondent had indicated was a proper contact and or representative for the respondent (Notice of hearing dated May 17, 2007; Resp. Motion dated March 17, 2007, and Attach.). See, e.g., Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540 (BIA 2002) (recognizing that an alien may be charged with receipt of a notice to appear where it is sent to and reaches the correct address, but is not received by the alien); Dominguez v. United States Attorney General, 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002) (finding that notice via regular mail to the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice). Notably, the respondent on appeal asserts that he phoned the Immigration Court on the day of his hearing in an attempt to explain why he could not attend. Thus, on this record, we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent received proper notice of his hearing. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”). Therefore, we find that the respondent received proper notice of his hearing. On this record, and in view of the 2007 final removal order, we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, for the reasons explained by the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution. Accordingly, we will enter the following order:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s appellate fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3)(2008). However, the respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).

We note that although the respondent on appeal asserts that he timely filed a motion to reopen on August 30, 2007, the record contains no evidence, i.e., dated envelopes or a motion date stamped by the Immigration Court, supporting such a claim. The respondent’s dated copies of such a motion that were submitted along with his August 11, 2008, motion to the Immigration Court are not alone sufficient to support the respondent’s claim.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Reynold E. Finnegan, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 This case is currently before the Board on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On January 16, 2004, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. Over three years later, on June 6, 2007, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen, 8 U.S.C. § 1003.2(c)(2), alleging that the time within which to file the motion should be equitably tolled due to his former attorney’s ineffective assistance of counsel. On September 28, 2007, the Board denied the respondent’s motion because he did not demonstrate due diligence in the filing of the instant motion. The respondent filed a petition for review, and, on remand, the Second Circuit has directed us to determine (1) when the respondent “should have been aware of any ineffective assistance on the part of prior counsel; and (2) whether ¿the respondentº exercised due diligence after the date on which he should have been aware of the asserted defects in his representation.” Sultanyan v. Mukasey, No. 07-4669-ag, 2008 WL 2928554 (2d Cir. 2008), citing Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007).
 
What makes answering the Second Circuit’s directives so difficult is that the respondent has provided almost no information with respect to due diligence. He generally alleges that he was not aware of the alleged prior ineffective assistance until March 22, 2007, when his wife took him to his current attorney’s office and his current attorney informed him of the alleged ineffective assistance. The respondent does not state when, or whether, he had knowledge of the Board’s decision, what actions he took to ascertain the status of his pending appeal, whether he ever contacted his former attorney during the pendency of the appeal or thereafter, or what other actions he may have taken before March 22, 2007. Further, he does not explain how his current attorney knew of former counsel’s ineffectiveness at the March 2007, meeting. For example, the respondent does not demonstrate what information, if any, that he provided to current counsel about his proceedings such as prior decisions, the record of proceedings, or copies of previously filed motions or briefs, or when. Neither the respondent nor current counsel indicate whether a FOIA request was filed, or otherwise demonstrate how current counsel was aware of the alleged deficiencies in former counsel’s arguments so as to inform the respondent of the alleged ineffectiveness on March 22, 2007, the alleged consultation day, or to so soon thereafter inform former counsel in detail of the alleged ineffectiveness and then quickly to file a disciplinary complaint.
 
The respondent has the burden to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence during the “entire” time he seeks to have tolled, which “includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). See also Wang v. BIA, supra at 716 (“Wang has failed to satisfy his burden of establishing due diligence..”); Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2007)(alien must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006)(“¿Nºo matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”); Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000)(alien has to demonstrate due diligence).
 
*2 In Rashid v. Mukasey, supra, which was decided after the Second Circuit remanded the record in this proceeding, the Court made clear that the due diligence inquiry covered the entire time the respondent seeks to have tolled. In light of Rashid, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that he exercised due diligence during the time he seeks to have tolled. The respondent indicates that he hired Mr. David to pursue his appeal, but fails to provide any further information about his interactions with Mr. David such as inquiring about the appeal, of when or whether he had knowledge of the Board’s decision, and of what he did (or did not do) if he had knowledge of the Board’s decision. See also Iavorski v. United States INS, supra.
 
Further, since the respondent’s generalized statement of knowledge as to when he became aware of the alleged ineffective assistance is not supported by any detailed information or corroborating evidence in the record, see para. 2, supra, and since the respondent has the burden of demonstrating due diligence, we find that the respondent should have known of the alleged ineffective assistance no later than the issuance of our decision in 2004. We further find that the respondent has not demonstrated that he exercised due diligence after the date on which he should have been aware of the asserted defects in his representation. Rashid v. Mukasey, supra; Cekic v. INS, supra. Therefore, under the circumstances, the respondent has not shown that he exercised due diligence. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely.

APPEAL

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nicole F. Kelly
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated November 26, 2007, finding that he had abandoned all applications for relief and ordering him removed to Mexico. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had abandoned his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), because “¿eºxamination of respondent’s counsel indicates that the application was sent to the Texas Service Center, but her records do not reflect any filing with the Court.” The Immigration Judge also stated that “this Court is faced with the situation of no application for relief.” I.J. at 2. In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent has filed a motion to remand. The record will be remanded.
 
The respondent seeks a remand on the grounds that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance, To warrant a remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance. The respondent has sufficiently complied with the Lozada requirements, including having given former counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations and having filed a disciplinary complaint against her. The record reflects that, on the date of the merits hearing in this case, the respondent was prepared to go forward with an application for discretionary relief. However, counsel had either not mailed the application to the court in compliance with the Immigration Judge’s previous deadline, or had mailed the application without making a record of such mailing. In any event, the application had not been received at the court by the date of the hearing, and the Immigration Judge therefore considered the application to be abandoned. It is clear from the evidence submitted, including the reply of former counsel, that the respondent himself was not the cause of the abandonment of his claim, as it is uncontested that he had cooperated with his counsel in a timely manner to prepare the application.
 
Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that the result may have been different if not for the deficient performance of former counsel. Accordingly, we will grant the respondent’s motion to remand to allow him to present further evidence in support of his application for relief.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is granted.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Ghana, filed a second motion to reopen on June 18, 2008. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on November 8, 2006, and denied a prior motion to reopen on March 21, 2008. This second motion to reopen is untimely (filed more than 90 days after the November 8, 2006, decision) and number barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
Although the respondent also characterizes the motion as a motion to reconsider, we deem it solely a motion to reopen as additional evidence has been submitted and underlying the motion is a claim of ineffective assistance of the respondent’s previous attorney, Lawrence Nwora, Esquire. The respondent claims that Mr. Nwora did not adequately represent him before the Immigration Judge. The record reveals that the respondent was represented by another attorney on appeal to the Board and still another attorney in the first motion to reopen filed with the Board.
 
The respondent has not complied with the threshold requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has not shown, inter alia, that he provided Mr. Nwora an opportunity to respond to the allegations. Although the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not held in a published decision that filing deadlines before this Board may be equitably tolled, the court has applied the doctrine of equitable tolling in unpublished cases. Nevertheless, even where applicable, equitable tolling of a regulatory deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. Rashidi v. American President Lines, 96 F.3d 124, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1996). The respondent who indicated that his best language is English (Tr. at 1, 8) was immediately aware of any alleged failure of Mr. Nwora to present available evidence at the hearing below and was represented by other attorneys on appeal and in the prior motion to reopen. Thus, he has not shown that he was precluded from filing a timely motion to reopen due to any ineffective assistance on the part of Mr. Nwora. Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent has not acted with due diligence. Consequently, equitable tolling is not warranted.
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and number barred.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Manuel D. Gomez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated September 25, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under former section 242B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § I252b(a)(2). The respondent has filed a timely appeal from that decision. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent entered the United States without inspection on or about December 23, 1994, at or near El Paso, Texas. The respondent subsequently was placed into deportation proceedings. On January 11, 1995, a Notice of Appearance, signed and dated by the respondent, was filed, listing Monty B. Roberson as the respondent’s attorney for deportation proceedings purposes. On February 22, 1995, the Immigration Court mailed written notice of a deportation hearing to the respondent’s attorney. The respondent failed to appear at his scheduled deportation hearing and was ordered deported in absentia on March 27, 1995 (I.J. dec. dated 3/27/95).
 
Some 13 years later, on September 4, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order in order to adjust status based on an approved I-140 visa petition filed by his employer. At that time, the respondent argued that he never received notice of the March 27, 1995, deportation hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion in a decision dated September 25, 2008. It is this most recent Immigration Judge decision that we now consider on appeal.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that proper notice of the March 27, 1995, hearing was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that a copy of the respondent’s hearing notice was mailed to the respondent’s former attorney via certified mail, return receipt requested, at his correct address, and the respondent does not argue otherwise. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2). Such notice is sufficient to constitute notice to the respondent of his hearing. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (Comm. 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). We acknowledge that both before the Immigration Judge and again on appeal, the respondent argues that his motion should have been granted based on an interpretation set forth by the Ninth Circuit in the case of Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2007). However, the respondent has provided no controlling authority from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, supporting his interpretation that notice to his then-attorney was insufficient to constitute receipt by the respondent. See Matter of K-S-, 20 I&N Dec. 715 (BIA 1993) (holding that the Board is not bound to follow the published decisions of a United States Circuit Court of Appeals outside of the circuit in whose jurisdiction the matter arises); see also Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 30-32 (BIA 1989). Most significantly, however, Sembiring v. Gonzales is not on point here, because notice was received by counsel of record who then attended the hearing.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent observes that his former attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel at the time of the March 27, 1995, hearing, which was granted by the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge then permitted the respondent’s attorney to receive a copy of the in absentia order on behalf of the respondent. The respondent argues on appeal that this did not effectuate service of the in absentia order on the respondent, because at the time it was issued, his former attorney had ceased to be the legal representative of the respondent and thus had “no legal duty or obligation to forward the order to Respondent or to communicate further with Respondent.” We find no merit to this argument. A review of the Immigration Judge’s March 27, 1995, order granting the motion to withdraw as counsel filed by the respondent’s former counsel specifically indicates that the motion was granted, “Except for receipt of ¿inº absentia order,” which the respondent’s attorney was still required to accept in his capacity as the respondent’s attorney, with all the responsibilities appurtenant thereto.
 
We observe that at no time did the respondent argue before the Immigration Judge that Mr. Roberson was not his attorney at the time the hearing notice was issued or at the time he appeared before the Immigration Judge for the March 27, 1995, deportation hearing. On the contrary, the respondent’s motion and arguments below presumed that his former attorney was, in fact, his attorney at all relevant times in question. However, on appeal, the respondent argues, for the first time, that the EOIR-28 completed by the respondent and Mr. Roberson was defective based on various incomplete portions, such that Mr. Roberson was never legally the respondent’s attorney. As the respondent failed to assert this argument before the Immigration Judge, we are without jurisdiction to consider it in the first instance. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (“¿AºI1 evidence which is pertinent to determinations made during deportation proceedings … must be adduced in the hearing before the immigration judge. The Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record.” (footnote omitted)).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent is now asserting that his failure to appear for his deportation hearing was due to exceptional circumstances based on the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, such a claim is precluded as untimely. See Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A), on the basis of exceptional circumstances).
 
*3 In light of our denial of the respondent’s appeal, we decline to address his further request for stay of deportation.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered. ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jonathan Y. Ai, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Menes
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, was physically removed from the United States in July 2005 pursuant to a final administrative order of removal. In December 2005, the respondent filed a motion with this Board in which he requested that his removal proceedings be reopened, but we denied the motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) (2006), which provides in relevant part that a motion to reopen shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal proceedings after his departure from the United States. The respondent thereafter filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and in a precedent decision issued on September 6, 2007, the Fourth Circuit invalidated 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) and remanded the matter to us for further adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reopen. William v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 329 (4th Cir. 2007). The motion to reopen will be denied.
  
I. BACKGROUND
 
In a decision dated February 19, 2002, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude on the basis of his 1997 Maryland conviction for receipt of stolen credit cards. Section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) (2000). This Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision in a final administrative order of removal issued on October 15, 2003. On November 17, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider, but that motion was denied because it was untimely filed.
 
On July 11, 2005, approximately 21 months after the respondent’s removal order became final, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) physically removed the respondent from the United States to Nigeria. In August 2005, several weeks after being removed, the respondent-acting through counsel-filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis with the Maryland court in which his 1997 receipt-of-stolen-credit-cards conviction had been entered. In an order issued on October 24, 2005, a judge of that court granted the petition, issued the writ, struck the respondent’s guilty plea, and set the respondent’s criminal case for a new trial after noting that the respondent had not been advised of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prior to entering his original plea. Several months later, on December 21, 2005, the respondent, again acting through counsel, filed a motion with the Board in which he argued that his removal proceedings should be reopened and terminated due to the vacatur of his 1997 conviction. As noted previously, we denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), but our decision in that regard was vacated by the Fourth Circuit, and the proceedings are now back before us for further review.
  
II. ISSUE
 
*2 After the Fourth Circuit remanded this matter to us, we issued a precedent decision reaffirming our conclusion that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) is a binding regulation that precludes us from exercising jurisdiction over motions to reopen filed by aliens who have departed the United States after being ordered removed. Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008). In that decision, we expressed our disagreement with William v. Gonzales, supra, while acknowledging that the decision is a binding precedent in removal proceedings arising within the Fourth Circuit. Id. at 655 n.7. Accordingly, our present task is to determine whether the respondent’s motion to reopen should be granted without regard to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). For the following reasons, we conclude that it should not.
  
III. DISCUSSION
 
Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored in the interests of finality and the conservation of administrative resources. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988); INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 144 n.5 (1981). In accordance with this disfavored status, Congress has imposed numerical and temporal limits on the filing of motions to reopen; specifically, aliens in removal proceedings are permitted to submit only one motion to reopen, which must be filed, if at all, within 90 days after entry of a final administrative order of removal. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C). An alien who files a motion to reopen before the expiration of this 90-day deadline must comply with a number of regulatory requirements, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1), and bears a heavy burden of persuasion akin to that which applies to a motion for a new trial in a criminal case on the basis of newly-discovered evidence. INS v. Abudu, supra, at 110.
 
Because of the aforementioned statutory limits, this Board generally does not entertain motions that are submitted after expiration of the 90-day filing deadline. However, it has long been recognized that we “retain¿º limited discretionary powers under the regulations to reopen or reconsider cases on our own motion.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (“The Board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision”). Because the exercise of this “sua sponte” reopening authority stands in some tension with the statutory restrictions on the filing of motions to reopen, it is a power that “we invoke … sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits …, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that incremental changes in decisional or statutory law occurring after entry of a final removal order do not justify sua sponte reopening); see also Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1217-18 (BIA 2000) (finding no basis for sua sponte reopening where alien’s untimely motion claimed ineffective assistance of counsel and alleged that the government had provided inadequate proof of his removability); Matter of J-J-, supra, at 984 (“The power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). According to every Federal court of appeals to have reviewed the question, the Board’s decision whether to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte is “committed to agency discretion” and unreviewable. See Tamenut v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 1000, 1004 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (collecting cases); see also Thoka v. Mukasey, No. 07-2163, 2008 WL 4185747 (4th Cir. 2008) (unpublished).
 
*3 The respondent’s motion to reopen was not filed until December 21, 2005, more than 26 months after the date when his removal order became final and more than 5 months after his physical removal from the United States. Consequently, the motion is time-barred under the statute, and the only question to be decided is whether an “exceptional circumstance” exists that would cause us to reopen the respondent’s proceedings on our own motion. According to the respondent, the vacatur of his 1997 Maryland conviction for receipt of stolen credit cards is such an exceptional circumstance. We disagree.
 
In cases where an alien was ordered removed, or denied relief from removal, on the basis of a criminal conviction, a timely motion demonstrating that the conviction in question was vacated will generally be granted in the exercise of discretion if the movant demonstrates that the vacatur was accomplished for reasons other than rehabilitation or the amelioration of immigration hardships. Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). Furthermore, as we have recognized in some of our unpublished cases, the vacatur of a criminal conviction can sometimes constitute an exceptional circumstance sufficient to justify invocation of our sua sponte reopening authority.
 
However, when a motion to reopen is filed long after the relevant removal order has become final, long after the statutory deadline for seeking reopening has passed and, indeed, long after the movant has in fact been physically removed from the United States (thereby consummating the removal proceedings in every legal sense), we believe the imperative of finality forbids reopening except upon a showing that enforcement of the removal order would constitute a gross miscarriage of justice. Cf. Matter of Roman, 19 I&N Dec. 855, 856-57 (BIA 1988) (holding that an alien may not collaterally attack a prior removal order unless he can show that the prior order resulted in a gross miscarriage of justice). Under our precedents, enforcement of a removal order constitutes a gross miscarriage of justice only if the order clearly could not have withstood judicial scrutiny under the law in effect at the time of its issuance or execution. Matter of Farinas, 12 I&N Dec. 467,471-72 (BIA 1967) (finding gross miscarriage of justice where alien’s deportation order, which was valid when entered, became invalid by virtue of controlling circuit precedent issued prior to the execution of the order); Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730, 731-32 (BIA 1966) (finding gross miscarriage of justice where alien’s deportation order was clearly not in accord with the law as interpreted at the time of issuance).
 
*4 The respondent’s removal order was entered in October 2003, and was executed in July 2005. On both of those dates, the respondent’s 1997 Maryland conviction for receipt of stolen credit cards was in full effect for immigration purposes and constituted a valid factual predicate for his removal. And while we acknowledge the respondent’s assertion that the conviction has since been vacated, the evidence reflects that the respondent did not even request such a vacatur until August 2005, several weeks after his removal had been effectuated. Where, as here, an alien has for no apparent reason failed to institute proceedings to vacate his conviction prior to his removal, but has instead “sle¿ptº on his rights ¿until afterº deportation has been accomplished,” we do not find that enforcement of the prior final order of removal constitutes a gross miscarriage of justice. Matter of C-, 8 I&N Dec. 611, 614 (BIA 1960) (finding no gross miscarriage of justice despite vacatur of conviction underlying exclusion order where the order was proper under the law in effect at the time of execution and where proceedings to vacate the conviction were not commenced until after order had been executed); see also Hernandez-Almanza v. INS, 547 F.2d 100, 103 (9th Cir. 1976) (same).
 
While we need not decide the question here, it is conceivable that a different result might have been appropriate had the respondent’s motion demonstrated that his conviction was the subject of a collateral attack prior to his removal, or that the vacatur resulted from the court’s consideration of exonerating evidence that had not been reasonably available until after the removal order was executed. Even then, however, the situation would be substantially complicated because the respondent’s physical removal from the United States in July 2005 had the effect of vitiating his former lawful permanent resident (“LPR”) status. Matter of Lok, 18 I&N Dec. 101, 106 (BIA 1981); Matter of Mosqueda, 14 I&N Dec. 55, 56-57 (R.C. 1972). A decision of this Board granting the respondent’s motion would not restore him to his prior LPR status, moreover, because such an order is merely an interlocutory measure authorizing the submission of new evidence; it does not abrogate the existing removal order or confer lawful immigration status on the movant. Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 354 (BIA 1998). Consequently, even were we to grant the respondent’s motion he could not return to this country except upon compliance with the DHS’ documentary and “admission” requirements, matters wholly out of our control, at least in the first instance. As the DHS notes in its brief, however, such admission would not be available to the respondent, absent a waiver, because his 2005 removal precludes him from seeking admission for a period of 10 years. Section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii)(I).
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
*5 In conclusion, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied because it is time-barred under section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act. Furthermore, this Board will decline to reopen the proceedings on our motion because the respondent has not demonstrated that the vacatur of his 1997 conviction, which occurred solely on the basis of proceedings commenced after execution of his lawful removal order, is an “exceptional circumstance” sufficient to warrant such an extraordinary remedy. The following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º -In the United States in violation of law
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was previously before the Board on June 15, 2007, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to provide her reasons for denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. Pursuant to our remand, the Immigration Judge issued a decision on September 5, 2007, setting forth the reasons for denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. In that decision, the Immigration Judge indicated that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely. The Immigration Judge also indicated, inter alia, that the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and was not eligible for adjustment of status based on his failure to the depart the United States during the voluntary departure period. On December 3, 2007, in lieu of a brief, the respondent submitted a letter indicating that he would “rely on the record ¿.º” Although we find this statement vague, we shall refer to the respondent’s previous brief on appeal, submitted on September 28, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. A motion to reopen before the Immigration Court, with exceptions not pertinent here, must be filed within 90 days after a final order of removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). As observed by the Immigration Judge, she rendered a final order of removal on April 19, 2006. However, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge did not receive the respondent’s motion to reopen until July 25, 2006, over 90 days past the filing deadline. In addition, the respondent does not argue that he qualifies for an exception to the filing deadline under the regulations or that equitable tolling applies in the case at bar.¿FN1º Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated therein that the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.¿FN2º See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725, 727 (6th Cir. 2007) (stating: “An alien who fails to comply with Lozada’s requirements forfeits ¿his orº her ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.”) (citations omitted). Because we have disposed of this case on untimeliness grounds and, alternatively, on Matter of Lozada requirements, we need not and will not reach the respondent’s remaining arguments. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Although the respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the merits hearing, he does not claim on appeal that he was delayed in filing a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge due to his former counsel’s deception, fraud, error, or other forms of ineffective assistance of counsel.

2

Before making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien generally must comply with procedural requirements established by the Board in Matter of Lozada, supra. In Matter of Lozada, the Board held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2) (A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated April 24, 2007. In that decision the Immigration Judge granted the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for adjustment of status that was denied prior to the initiation of these proceedings on October 25, 2002, based on a finding that the respondent’s conviction for Misprision of a Felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 4 created “reason to believe” that the respondent “is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance … (Exh. 1).” See section 212(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 11182(a)(2)(C)(i). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent does not allege any error on the part of the Immigration Judge. Instead, the respondent claims that his two prior counsels acted ineffectively by virtue of their failure to effectively oppose the DHS’s motion to pretermit the application for adjustment of status and to object to the admission of a presentence report as hearsay that the DHS submitted in support of the motion to pretermit on May 19, 2003 (Exh. 4).
 
We note as an initial matter that the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel drawn out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Among other things, a properly presented claim for ineffective assistance of counsel must “be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent’s ineffective assistance claim is unsupported by such an affidavit and does not specifically indicate the parameters of the agreements the respondent claims to have entered into with the prior representatives.
 
Moreover, in examining the actual substance of the ineffective assistance claim, we conclude that the respondent shows no prejudice because the Immigration Judge’s rulings are correct as a matter of law. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (“To show a deprivation of due process caused by ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must show that counsel’s ineffective performance prejudiced her.”) (citation omitted); Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (recognizing that when the alien presents no plausible grounds for relief from inadmissibility, there is no prejudice from representative’s failure to file a brief). First, although some of the evidence in the record of proceeding might have been inadmissible for purposes of establishing the respondent’s removability based on the Misprision of a Felony conviction, all of the evidence in the record of proceeding is admissible for the purpose of establishing the respondent’s inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act and consequent ineligibility for adjustment of status (Exhs. 3, 4). See Lopez-Molina v. Ashcroft, 368 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir. 2004). Second, hearsay evidence is generally admissible in removal proceedings. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra., at 823-24 (9th Cir. 2003) (recognizing due process is not violated by determination that there is a reason to believe alien was a drug trafficker based on hearsay evidence); Matter of Wadud, 19 I&N Dec. 182, 188 (BIA 1984) (“Under the circumstances in this case, we conclude that it is appropriate to consider the sentencing memorandum in determining whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted.”).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).¿FN1º See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

In its opposition to the respondent’s appeal, the DHS asserts that the respondent has failed to post the required voluntary departure bond (The DHS’s Br. at 2, n.1). Inasmuch as arguments in briefs are generally not considered evidence as, for example, a sworn statement to the same effect would be evidence, we have no actual evidence at this time on the basis of which to revoke the respondent’s privilege of voluntarily departing the United States. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188 n. 6 (1984) (“Counsel’s unsupported assertions in respondent’s brief do not establish that respondent could satisfy the “‘continuous physical presence” requirement.”’). However, by the terms of the voluntary departure order, the respondent will have lost this privilege automatically by operation of law if he has, as alleged by the DHS, failed to comply with the terms imposed by the Immigration Judge.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Toni Messina, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Suriname who has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 3, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered deported in absentia on November 8, 2007. The respondent failed to file a timely brief in support of his appeal and no brief was received from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).¿FN1º The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent contends on his Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in ordering him deported in absentia because his counsel was ineffective for appearing late for immigration court and for possibly providing the respondent with the wrong hearing date.¿FN2º We have held that to satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support his claim by a detailed affidavit, inform counsel of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Here, the respondent has failed to satisfy any of the Lozada requirements. See Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2nd Cir. 2005) (holding that strict adherence to the Lozada requirements is not compulsory if an alien demonstrates “substantial compliance”). As the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is the only issue raised on appeal and because the respondent failed to comply with Lozada, we find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On January 22, 2008, the respondent’s counsel filed a Notice of Appeal that was missing page three and was unaccompanied by a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Board of Immigration Appeals (Form EOIR-27). The respondent was therefore considered pro se. We sent a briefing schedule to the respondent on February 4, 2008, granting him until February 25, 2008, to submit a brief. The respondent’s attorney submitted a Form EOIR-27 on February 13, 2008; however, she did not file a request for a briefing schedule extension until July 21, 2008, almost 5 months after the expiration of the briefing schedule. That request was denied on July 22, 2008. We note that counsel stated in her briefing schedule extension request that she was alternatively withdrawing her request to submit a brief

We review findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, but we may review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii) (2008); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).

APPLICATION: Reopening; cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act
 
*1 On January 31, 2008, the Board dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the respondent’s appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge, as the respondent had requested only voluntary departure and waived his right to appeal. We accordingly returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.
 
The Board does not normally have jurisdiction over motions filed in cases where the Board never assumed initial jurisdiction. See Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998); Matter of Madineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). However, the Board may consider a motion challenging an earlier determination that we lacked jurisdiction over the alien’s appeal. See Matter of Lopez, supra. The respondent alleges in his motion that he did not voluntarily waive his right to appeal, and that such waiver was instead the result of ineffective assistance provided by his former counsel. As the respondent now raises issues relating to our prior determination that we lacked jurisdiction over his appeal due to his waiver of his appeal rights, we will address the arguments set forth in his motion.
 
In order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), affd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and establish that he was prejudiced by counsel’s ineffective assistance. See, e.g., Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We find that the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the Lozada requirements. Specifically, Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that “before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond.” See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. This requirement is not a mere formality, but rather serves the dual functions of discouraging baseless allegations and providing attorneys “whose integrity or competence is being impugned, ¿the opportunityº to present ¿theirº version of events,” if they choose to do so. Id. Moreover, providing notice to the attorney whose actions are being challenged, and allowing him sufficient time to respond, is a central element in this Board’s capacity to adjudicate ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra, at 598-99. The respondent’s motion contains no indication that his former attorney has been apprised of the serious allegations that the respondent has levied against him. The respondent has thus failed to comply with this vital Lozada requirement.
 
*2 We do not find that waiver of this crucial element is appropriate, as “the facts underlying the ¿respondent’sº claim ¿areº not ‘plain on the face of the administrative record.”’ See Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra, at 597 (citation omitted). In particular, while the respondent claims that former counsel rendered defective services by accepting voluntary departure on his behalf and waiving his appeal rights rather than filing an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § I229b(b)(1), the respondent’s motion does not reveal that he was prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal at the time of his final removal hearing on March 29, 2007. Indeed, all of the documentation that the respondent has now presented in relation to the hardship requirement set forth at section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act postdates his final removal hearing. See Respondent’s Motion at Tab D. It thus is not “plain on the face of the administrative record” that the respondent’s acceptance of voluntary departure and waiver of his appeal rights were the result of ineffective assistance of counsel rather than appropriate legal strategy. See Tr. at 7-9. Furthermore, as the respondent has not shown that he was eligible for any relief other than voluntary departure at his final removal hearing, he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s actions.
 
In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish that his waiver of his right to appeal was inoperative. We thus find no error in our January 31, 2008, determination that we lacked jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal. As such, we now conclude that we likewise lack jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas H. Kim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nicole F. Kelly
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION; Cancellation of removal
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision of November 14, 2007, finding his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b) to have been abandoned. The appeal will be sustained and the record remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance from his former counsel in these proceedings because his former counsel failed to appear for his merits hearing. The respondent also argues that his former counsel did not answer calls to prepare his cancellation of removal application prior to the hearing. During the hearing, the respondent testified that although his attorney failed to file his application for cancellation of removal, and failed to appear for the hearing, he “wanted to go forward and try to stop the removal” (Tr. at 6). The respondent contends that counsel’s ineffective assistance prejudiced his case because he was unable to present evidence that his removal would cause hardship to his family (Respondent’s brief at 2). The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for establishing attorney negligence and prior counsel has not responded to the allegation. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also exhs. 21, 23. Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand these proceedings based on the respondent’s charges that set forth a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. On remand, the respondent will be given the opportunity to present additional evidence relevant to his application.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and for the entry of a new decision consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) º -Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(l)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated February 28, 2008, finding the respondent removable under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and NationalityAct, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(l)(C)(i), and ordering him removed to Nigeria. Theappeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and other issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(h).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding him removable under section 237(a)(l)(C)(i) of the Act for failure to maintain the conditions of his nonimmigrant student status because at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, he was already back in school and was working on his reinstatement. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that, in the case of an alien who has been admitted to the United States, the alien is deportable. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a). No decision of deportability shall be valid unless it is based on reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act.
 
An F-1 student is admitted for the duration of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(5). Duration of status is defined as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of studies at an educational institution approved by the DHS for attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized practical training following completion of studies, plus 60 days to prepare for departure from the United States. Id. A student is considered to be maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward completing a course of studies. Id.
 
In this case, the respondent’s status was changed to that of an F-1 student after he was admitted to the United States on September 24, 1996, as a J-2 nonimmigrant exchange visitor. At the September 6, 2007, hearing, the respondent, through counsel, conceded that he was not in status as an F-1 student, had not been a full-time student during the Fall 2002 semester, and had failed to attend Monmouth University since 2003 (Tr. at 31, 38-39). We agree with the Immigration Judge that these concessions, as well as letters from the university (Exh. 3; Tr. at 39), establish by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent was not pursuing a full course of studies, was in violation of his nonimmigrant student status, and is removable under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 The respondent argues that his status is in the process of being reinstated and that he is currently attending the university. A student’s status may be reinstated by filing a Form I-539 if the respondent demonstrates that he has not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing unless exceptional circumstances prevented him from timely filing. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16). However, the respondent has been out of status since at least 2003, and he has not shown that such status has been reinstated or that he is even eligible to have his status reinstated. Additionally, we do not find that a remand is warranted to consider a letter from a school official from Monmouth University where the respondent did not comply with the regulatory requirements for reopening and the school official indicates that she has not proceeded with an F-1 student status reinstatement.
 
The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge should have continued the proceedings when his attorney requested permission to withdraw from representing the respondent a day before the February 28, 2008, hearing and did not appear for the hearing. The Immigration Judge may grant a motion for a continuance for good cause shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. We find that the Immigration Judge correctly found no good cause for a continuance where the respondent had been in removal proceedings for 4 years, the case had been continued a number of times after the Board’s May 10, 2006, decision remanding the proceedings to the Immigration Court, the record established the respondent’s removability under the lodged charge, and the respondent did not have pending any application for relief from removal. We note that the respondent has not complied with the conditions set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec.637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1stCir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
With respect to the respondent’s arguments regarding his eligibility for an adjustment of status, the record reflects that the visa petition filed on the respondent’s behalf by his United States citizen wife was denied by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on July 11, 2005. There is no evidence that such decision has been appealed. Because the respondent has no approved visa petition, he is not eligible for an adjustment of status.
 
The respondent also makes arguments regarding the charge of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. We point out that the Immigration Judge did not find the respondent removable under that section of the Act. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stacy Tolchin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lily C. Hsu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In our January 18, 2005, decision, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal and agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was convicted of an aggravated felony on April 29, 2003. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, filed a motion to reopen on July 24, 2008. The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is untimely. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2). The DHS does not challenge the respondent’s assertion that despite his removal the Board has jurisdiction of the motion to reopen because it arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
 
The respondent asserts that reopening is warranted due to ineffective assistance provided by his former attorney, Gary Finn, Esquire. Equitable tolling of the time limit for a motion to reopen is available to an alien who has filed with the Board an otherwise untimely motion in which he or she raises allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien is prevented from timely filing of the motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 111 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002), and cases cited therein. The respondent claims that his former attorney on appeal should have contested the Immigration Judge’s finding that one of his firearms convictions was a crime involving moral turpitude, an argument which he believes could have resulted in his being found statutorily eligible for adjustment of status without a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act. The respondent married his United States citizen wife in February 2005, shortly after the Board’s decision. He claims that his former attorney was aware that he had a long term relationship with a United States citizen with whom he has a United States citizen child and advised him while his appeal was pending that marriage to her would not help his case.
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the threshold requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent’s former attorney has not responded to the allegations in the motion. However, we observe that in representing the respondent on appeal, Mr. Finn, in addition to filing a brief on appeal filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to withdraw as the attorney of record, serving a copy on the respondent, which asserts that the respondent had not paid legal fees as required under the contract and had failed to maintain adequate communications with Mr. Finn. These assertions are inconsistent with the respondent’s assertions in his statement in support of the motion.
 
*2 Separate and apart from the inconsistencies between the statement of the respondent and the information previously provided by his former counsel, the respondent, through current counsel, argues that the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a crime involving moral turpitude (Respondent’s Reply to Government’s Opposition at 2). However, the Immigration Judge did not find that the respondent’s conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm was a crime involving moral turpitude. Rather, the Immigration Judge found that the conviction as a felon in possession of a firearm was for an aggravated felony and that the separate conviction for knowingly permitting another to discharge a firearm from his vehicle was a crime involving moral turpitude. See IJ. at 3-4. Moreover, to the extent that the respondent argues in the alternative that conviction for knowingly permitting another to discharge a firearm from his vehicle is not a crime involving moral turpitude, we note that the Ninth Circuit case law cited in support of that proposition was issued after our January 18, 2005, decision. Under the circumstances, we cannot conclude that the former attorney’s failure to contest that portion of the Immigration Judge’s decision constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, as opposed to a tactical decision on the part of the respondent’s former attorney.
 
Further, we agree with DHS that the respondent, as a lawful permanent resident convicted of an aggravated felony, is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 212(h) of the Act. Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610 (BIA 1996). Furthermore, an alien seeking reopening for adjustment of status must make a prima facie showing that he is eligible as a matter of law for the relief sought upon reopening and that such relief would likely be granted in the exercise of discretion. Matter of Rodriguez-Vera, 17 I & N Dec.105 (BIA 1979). This respondent’s criminal history includes a conviction for an aggravated felony, which alone is considered sufficient to preclude him from a section 212(h) waiver as a lawful permanent resident. Even if statutory eligibility for adjustment of status were otherwise shown, the respondent has not shown that his lengthy residence in the United States and family ties would have been sufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for a favorable exercise of discretion. Consequently, we would not find that the respondent was prejudiced by his former counsel’s tactical decision assuming arguendo that it affected his statutory eligibility for future relief, and equitable tolling of the period for filing motions to reopen is not warranted. We also decline to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Toufighi v. Mukasey, 510 F.3d 1059, 1063, fn.8 (9th Cir. 2007) (court lacks jurisdiction to review Board’s decision to not reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority).
*3 Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Earl Ian Laidlow, Esquire
*1 Notice:
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
 
This case was last before the Board on September 18, 2007, when we affirmed an Immigration Judge’s July 5, 2005, decision that the respondent did not warrant a discretionary grant of cancellation of his removal to his native country of Jamaica under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S. C. § 1229b(a). In his July 5, 2005, decision, the Immigration Judge had also found that the respondent would be ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994). On June 9, 2008, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent asserts that he is entitled to reopening based on the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, Andrew Crumbie, during the course of the respondent’s appeal.¿FN1º Specifically, the respondent claims that Crumbie failed to raise on appeal certain alleged deficiencies in the Immigration Judge’s July 5, 2005, balancing of the equities in deciding whether the respondent warranted cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. The respondent further claims that Crumbie delayed notifying him of our September 18, 2007, final decision until April 14, 2008, and thereby deprived him of the opportunity to file a timely motion to reopen or reconsider before the Board, or a petition for review of our September 18, 2007, decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Finally, the respondent generally claims that Crumbie deprived him of a meaningful opportunity for review of the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding his eligibility for section 212(c) relief.
 
Even if we deem the respondent’s motion timely, he still is ineligible for reopening of these proceedings. Initially, to the extent the respondent claims that Crumbie was ineffective in failing to assert his eligibility for section 212(c) relief, the respondent has failed to comply substantially with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as he has failed to offer any evidence of the nature of his agreement with Crumbie regarding the handling of that issue, that he notified Crumbie of his alleged failure to argue his section 212(c) eligibility, and that he filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities concerning Crumbie’s handling of that issue. Accordingly, the respondent’s claim that he is entitled to reopening based on Crumbie’s decision not to pursue section 212(c) relief fails. See Zheng v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements in his motion to reopen before the Board forfeits his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim).
 
*2 Moreover, although the respondent has substantially met Lozada’s requirements with respect to his claims that Crumbie mishandled his appeal of the denial of cancellation of removal and failed to apprise him of our adverse decision early enough for him to seek timely further review, he has failed to demonstrate that he merits reopening on those grounds. The respondent has not demonstrated that he sustained prejudice from these alleged errors. See Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2007). Specifically, even when we consider the respondent’s business ties to the United States along with his other favorable equities of record, they are still not outweighed by the serious adverse factors in this case that were duly noted by the Immigration Judge, including the respondent’s criminal convictions, his repeated lies about his criminal history during the naturalization process, and his ambivalent testimony concerning his accountability for his crimes — a factor that is relevant to the issue of rehabilitation (I.J. at 2-4, 9-12; Tr. at 49-60, 63-65, 72, 79-81, 89; Exhs. 11, 12). The fact that the respondent was pro se during the naturalization process does not mitigate the seriousness of his decision to lie to immigration officials about his criminal history during that process. Further, contrary to the respondent’s contention, any challenge by Crumbie to the Immigration Judge’s consideration of his drug arrest (that did not result in a conviction) as a negative discretionary factor would have been meritless. See, e.g., Matter of Texeira, 21 I&N Dec. 316, 321 (BIA 1996) (explaining that evidence of misconduct contained in police reports is not admissible to prove a charge of deportability that is predicated on “convicted” conduct only, but that such evidence is admissible in the context of adjudicating an application for discretionary relief). In sum, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that Crumbie’s alleged erroneous handling of his cancellation claim on appeal and improper late notification of our September 18, 2007, decision affected the outcome of this case.
 
Finally, and based on the foregoing, we also find that sua sponte reopening of these proceedings is unwarranted. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Footnotes

1

We note that the respondent also argues, in passing, a separate basis for reopening these proceedings — to wit, that he now has a newborn child who would suffer hardship upon the respondent’s repatriation to Jamaica, and that such hardship militates in favor of a discretionary grant of cancellation of removal (Motion to Reopen at 22). -However, the respondent has failed to support his motion to reopen with any evidence of the existence of this child or of what hardship this child would suffer upon the respondent’s repatriation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen must be supported by new, material evidence). Accordingly, the respondent does not warrant reopening on that basis.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert B. Jobe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lesley L. Novotny
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2008, denial of her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on April 14, 1994. The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she failed to appear at the hearing set for April 14, 1994, due to a lack of proper service of the Order to Show Cause (OSC) and no notice of the hearing. She contends that she was only 15 years old at the time of her entry into the United States when she was served with the OSC. She asserts that, as she was placed in her adult brother’s custody upon release from detention, he should have been served with the OSC or with written notice of her hearing, which was not done. The respondent cites to Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 1150, (9th Cir. 2004) in support of her argument. However, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the case at bar is distinguishable from Flores-Chavez, supra, because the record reflects that the respondent in this case was represented by counsel who received notice of all relevant hearings in accordance with the regulations. We find no authority for the proposition that notice is required to be provided to the respondent’s adult brother in addition to notice to her counsel of record. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R § 1292.5(a); Garcia v. INS, 222 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir. 2000)(notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien). While the respondent, in a footnote in her motion, mentioned a possible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to her former attorney’s representation, as noted by the Immigration Judge, she has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), or otherwise shown that there was ineffective assistance of counsel which prevented her from attending her hearing.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul Haley, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand; cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely pro se appeal of an Immigration Judge’s September 9, 2008, order deeming his application for cancellation of removal abandoned, and ordering him removed to his native country of Poland. On appeal the respondent contends the Immigration Judge erred by proceeding with the hearing although his attorney had failed to appear (Notice of Appeal). He essentially maintains the Immigration Judge should have continued proceedings. While the appeal was pending the respondent, through counsel, submitted a “motion to reopen” proceedings in which he reported that his counsel had filed a motion to continue proceedings with the Immigration Judge which the counsel “mistakenly believed” had been granted. As such, respondent’s counsel did not appear for the scheduled hearing. The respondent avers he has a “valid basis” for the filing of an application for cancellation of removal, and asks that proceedings be reopened.
 
The record reflects that the respondent appeared with counsel at a July 22, 2008, hearing. At that time the Immigration Judge granted a continuance to September 9, 2008 (Tr. at 2). The Immigration Judge directed counsel to appear at the rescheduled hearing with various documents, including certified docket sheets regarding the respondent’s criminal convictions (Tr. at 2-5). On September 8, 2008, the day before the scheduled hearing, respondent’s counsel submitted a motion to continue proceedings, wherein counsel asked for a continuance “in order to assemble the information and documents required by the honorable Court.” The next day, when the hearing reconvened, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as insufficient cause was presented for a continuance (Tr. at 8). Respondent’s counsel failed to appear, nor did he contact the respondent (Tr. at 8). The respondent reported that he met with counsel two or three weeks before the hearing to complete his application for relief, but that the same could not be submitted as it was with counsel (Tr. at 9, 16).
 
We initially note that the respondent’s motion is correctly characterized as one seeking remand, not reopening, given its procedural posture. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Although the respondent does not present arguments in this regard, we find that the case before us presents a per se example of ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel admits in the motion that he deliberately did not appear at the scheduled hearing as he for some unstated reason “believed” that a motion which he had filed only the day before had been granted. Counsel does not explain the basis for his belief, nor does he state why he did not contact the respondent and inform him of the court’s alleged granting of the motion. Moreover, counsel does not explain why the respondent was unable to reach him despite apparent repeated attempts to do so. Counsel’s failure to appear and submit the requested documents resulted in the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal being deemed abandoned by the Immigration Judge. Given this unusual record, which includes counsel’s noted admissions, we find that the record supports a finding that the respondent was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel which clearly resulted in prejudice to him. See Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2001) (where mitigating factors are present, strict compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), is not necessary); see also Tai v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2005); Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147 (1st Cir. 2004).¿FN1º As such, we find that a remand is warranted.
 
*2 Therefore, the respondent’s motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent an opportunity to present his application for cancellation of removal, and to pursue any other relief for which he may be eligible.¿FN2º

IN RE: JOSE LUIS BAEZ-AREVALO
File; AXXX XX8 127 - Tacoma, WA
December 2, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John C. Odell
Senior Attorney
*1 An Immigration Judge issued a final order of removal against the respondent, who is from Mexico, on October 7, 2008. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38. The appeal was filed late, on November 10, 2008. The respondent filed with his appeal a “Motion To Reopen Or Alternate Motion To Reissue the Order of the Court.” The respondent urges the Board to accept the appeal out of time. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the respondent’s request that the appeal be accepted despite being untimely.
 
The respondent argues that his former attorney, Kaaren Barr, would not file the appeal until paid a fee to do so, as well as payment for an immigration bond, and did not specifically tell the respondent that he could file the appeal on his own. The respondent also states that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, on October 30, 2008, issued an Order to Show Cause against Barr as to why she should not be sanctioned based on actions “in many of the 236 cases in which she has appeared before the court to date.” In Re Kaaren Barr, Case No. 08-80164. Barr has not yet been sanctioned by the Ninth Circuit, and may request a hearing.
 
In any event, a respondent claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s actions. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 2008 WL 4925056 (9th Cir. Nov. 19, 2008)(“prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. The petitioner does not need to show that she would win on her claims absent her attorneys’ deficient performance. She need only show plausible grounds for relief” (citations omitted)).
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, based on his admissions, as one present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. The Immigration Judge further found that the respondent had made no application for relief from removal. The respondent argues that he should have been able to seek cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1)(Respondent’s Mot., at p. 3). Yet the respondent fails to specifically describe the relatives he claims to have that would qualify him for such relief. Section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act; DHS Opp. Indeed, the Record of Deportable/Inadmissibie Alien, Form I-213, prepared for the respondent, indicates that he is single with no children, and his parents are in Mexico. DHS Opp. The DHS also states that “¿theº ¿rºespondent confirmed that he has no qualifying relatives during his master calendar hearing on October 7, 2008.” Therefore, in the absence of a showing of plausible grounds for relief, the respondent fails to adequately demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the performance of counsel, and the appeal will be dismissed as untimely filed.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31 (1999).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Benjamin V. Chen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anibal D. Martinez
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on May 30, 2008, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s September 26, 2007, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered February 12, 2007.
 
On August 28, 2008, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings. The motion is number barred. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) (providing an exception only to the time, but not to the numerical, restrictions on motions in removal proceedings). However, due to the circumstances presented in this case, and to resolve any issue regarding jurisdiction in this case, we will adjudicate the instant motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent’s first motion to reopen (which was also premised on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Attorney Jisheng Li), was denied because the respondent failed to provide her own affidavit as required by our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Mr. Li, who represented the respondent with her first motion to reopen and on appeal, admitted that he advised the respondent not to attend her removal hearing. However, in filing the motion to reopen and an appeal brief on the respondent’s behalf, he simply argued that his affidavit was sufficient to meet the Lozada requirements. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen filed with the Immigration Court on July 2, 2007.
 
The respondent is now represented by new counsel. The instant motion is supported by her own detailed affidavit. She confirms that Mr. Li advised her not to appear for her removal hearing. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment F at 4. The respondent’s brother-in-law, who was with the respondent and Mr. Li, states the same. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment G at 2. Reasonable reliance on professional immigration advice may constitute an exceptional circumstance for a nonappearance. See Gatvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798 (5th Cir. 2007); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I & N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). The respondent has complied with the Lozada requirements and established that Mr. Li’s conduct prejudiced her case.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be granted. On remand, the Immigration Judge can determine whether the respondent has established exceptional circumstances for her failure to file for asylum within one year of her arrival in the United States. See section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2), (5).
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen these removal proceedings, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision. The respondent’s motion to change venue will be granted. The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a change in venue from San Antonio, Texas, to Honolulu, Hawaii, is granted.

IN RE: TIAN YIN LIN, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY CONG NGOC LAI, PETITIONER
File: AXXX XX2 181 - Los Angeles, CA
November 28, 2008
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Luisito L. Lopez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret M. Jambor
Associate Regional Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
*1 The petitioner appeals from the May 7, 2008, decision of the Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship and Immigration Services (“DHS”), denying the petition filed on behalf of the beneficiary as the step-child of a United States citizen. The appeal will be dismissed as the petitioner did not meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his marriage to the beneficiary’s mother is bona fide.
 
In response to a Notice of Intent to Deny, the petitioner submitted documentary evidence to establish a shared life together with the beneficiary’s mother. However, such evidence must be considered in conjunction with the material discrepancies between the statements of the petitioner and the beneficiary’s mother at an interviews with the DHS and the results of an investigation into the petitioner’s marriage by the DHS. The inconsistencies revealed by the DHS investigation, which are set forth in the February 12, 2008, Notice of Intent to Deny the petition, as well as in the February 29, 2008, Notice of Intent to Deny the instant petition, provided serious reasons for believing that the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary’s mother was not bona fide.
 
The petitioner and the beneficiary’s mother did not know the names of each other’s siblings, and the beneficiary’s mother did not know how much her husband earns, even after 4 years of marriage. Further, an investigation conducted by the DHS showed the petitioner and the beneficiary’s mother did not appear to have been together in their home as they claimed, a roommate had not seen the petitioner at the house in a long time, the petitioner and the beneficiary’s mother changed their stories about when they left the house, and finally, the beneficiary’s mother’s was evasive when interviewed at work about her arrival there, even being evasive about her time card.
 
In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefits sought. See Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. See Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989).¿FN1º Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that it was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws.¿FN2º See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). However, we note that the failure to produce affirmative evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the marriage is a fraudulent marriage. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B), (D) with 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(l)(ii).
 
*2 In light of the doubts raised about the validity of the marriage, we must agree that the weight of the documentary evidence submitted by the petitioner does not overcome the doubts in order to meet his burden of establishing the marriage is bona fide. When the bona fides of a marriage are in question, evidence which might ordinarily be sufficient to meet the petitioner’s burden of proof in this matter, is insufficient in this case because of the substantial evidence in the record that weighs against a finding that the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary’s mother is bona fide.
 
On appeal, the petitioner asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceedings is a denial of due process if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). Methods of case presentation are within counsel’s professional judgment and are afforded great deference. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 688-89. Strategic decisions, such as whether to call a particular witness at the hearing, rest upon the sound professional judgment of the lawyer. Such appropriately informed strategic decisions are virtually unchallengeable. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 690.
 
The District Director found that statements by counsel made in rebuttal to the NOID were not evidence as there were not personal affidavits. However, even if we accept the statements of counsel as true, we are not persuaded by the explanations for the lack of knowledge about each other’s lives or the attempts to create doubt about the discrepancies material to the bona fides of the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary’s mother which were revealed by the investigation of the DHS. Thus, the petitioner was not prevented from reasonably presenting his case.
 
The petitioner is not precluded from filing a new petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is fully supported by consistent evidence that the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary’s mother is bona fide. Nevertheless, the petitioner’s motion to remand is denied and the appeal is dismissed because the petitioner did not meet his burden of proving the bona fides of his marriage to the beneficiary’s mother by a preponderance of the evidence.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The “clear and convincing” standard applies to a marriage entered into by an alien during removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1154(g), 1255(e); 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(l)(iii). As the beneficiary was not in removal proceedings when the parties married, that standard is inapplicable here.

2

Evidence to establish the bona fides of a marriage includes proof of joint ownership of property, proof of joint tenancy of a common residence, proof of commingling of financial resources, birth certificates of children born of the petitioner and the beneficiary, and affidavits of others having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(l)(iii)(B).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ian E. Silverberg, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to Reissue
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on December 28, 2007, when we summarily affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent relief from removal. The respondent now moves for reissuance of this Board’s prior decision due to counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance in failing to timely file a petition for review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Department of Homeland Security has filed no opposition or other response to this motion, and the motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion will be granted.
 
The motion includes some evidence of compliance with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that counsel has admitted that his office erred by filing the petition for review with this Board rather than the Ninth Circuit, and that such petition was subsequently re-filed with the Ninth Circuit but was untimely. Counsel has submitted a copy of his letter “self-reporting” his actions to the State Bar of Nevada. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We emphasize that any such ineffective assistance is based on counsel’s representation before the Ninth Circuit, and does not implicate any ineffective assistance in the administrative proceedings before the Immigration Judge or the Board. Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit has explained that when an alien is prevented from filing an appeal in immigration proceedings due to counsel’s error, and is thereby deprived of appellate proceedings entirely, such error mandates a presumption of prejudice inasmuch as the adversary process itself has been rendered presumptively unreliable. See Dearinger v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (9th Cir. 2000) (upholding a district court decision ordering the Board to reissue its decision where counsel filed a petition for review 1 day late). In light of the above, we will grant the motion to reissue.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s decision dated December 28, 2007, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

File: AXXX XX8 117 - Baltimore, MD

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph M. Kum, Esquire
*1 In a decision dated April 23, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ordered him removed from the United States to Tanzania. The respondent, a native and citizen of Tanzania, has appealed from that decision. On appeal, the respondent has filed a motion to remand in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion to remand. The motion will be granted and the proceedings remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends the Immigration Judge erred in failing to continue the proceedings on April 23, 2007, because his attorney was not present. See Notice of Appeal. Newly retained counsel alleges that former counsel provided ineffective representation by failing to appear at the respondent’s hearing on April 23, 2007, and also failed to file an immediate relative petition on behalf of the respondent based upon his marriage to a United States citizen on December 7, 2004.
 
We find that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006). The respondent submitted an affidavit discussing his agreements with former counsel, dated May 10, 2005, and October 19, 2006, and the ways in which he believes former counsel failed to provide effective representation during his removal hearing and in connection with his pursuit of adjustment of status. The respondent also filed a complaint with the District of Columbia Bar Association and sent notification to his former attorney. We find that the respondent has demonstrated that his application for relief was prejudiced by the actions or inaction of his former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (requiring an alien to demonstrate not only ineffective assistance but also prejudice that occurred as a result). The respondent has submitted evidence that he is a beneficiary of an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative and has attached numerous documents in support of that petition, evidencing that his marriage is bona fide. He consequently appears prima facie eligible for adjustment of status (should the I-130 petition ultimately be approved). Accordingly, the motion to remand to pursue his application for adjustment of status is granted.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s July 18, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear at a July 23, 2004, hearing.
 
On appeal and in his motion, the respondent contends that he failed to appear for his hearing on July 23, 2004, due to ineffective assistance of counsel. He states that his former attorney of record, Theodore Clapp, advised the respondent not to appear for his hearing as he would be taken into custody at the hearing. The respondent claims that Mr. Clapp failed to inform him that he may be eligible for relief from deportation. The respondent further explained that Mr. Clapp incorrectly filed an appeal with the Board, and then did not inform him that the Board dismissed the appeal. The respondent contends that Mr. Clapp subsequently resigned from the practice of law. The respondent also requested sua sponte reopening of his case.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order, pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, supra. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had substantially complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada (I.J. at 4).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s decision to follow his former counsel’s advice instead of the Immigration Court’s mandate does not constitute “exceptional circumstances” beyond his control within the meaning of section 240(e) of the Act (I.J. at 4-5). See, e.g., Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943, 946-47 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
*2 We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to act with due diligence such that equitable tolling was warranted in his late filed motion (I.J. at 5). The respondent failed to provide a persuasive explanation for why he waited until July 10, 2008 — nearly 4 years after the in absentia order of removal — to file his motion before the Immigration Judge. Despite knowing he was in deportation proceedings, and that an in absentia removal order had been entered in his case, the respondent failed to act with due diligence in checking the status of his appeal. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cr. 2003) (recognizing equitable tolling on motion to reopen during periods when alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien “acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding due diligence since new counsel promptly retained and motion to reopen filed after aliens learned conclusively that they had been misled by a non-attorney).
 
We concur in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening of the respondent’s case (I. J. at 5-6). See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). In sum, we do not find that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondents, natives and citizens of Brazil, appeal the Immigration Judge’s, January 30, 2007, denial of their request for a continuance. The appeal is dismissed.
 
Between November 9, 2004, and January 30, 2007, the respondents appeared at seven separate hearings and conceded removability, but never filed an application for relief, as instructed by two separate Immigration Judges (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 1 -38). In the Notice of Appeal, the respondents assert that the Immigration Judge currently presiding over the case erred by failing to grant them a further continuance when they were represented by a notorious immigration attorney who failed to safeguard their interests. In their appellate brief, they further aver that in 2001, they applied for a “religious visa,” and their former attorney has the documentation necessary for them to seek permanent resident status.
 
It is the respondents’ burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal in these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The regulations further provide that if an application or supportive documentation is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.31(c); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992) (“The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them.”); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 1979). To date, the respondents have not filed an application for relief or explained their prima facie eligibility for any type of relief. Construing their appeal as a request to seek adjustment of status, they have identified no available immigrant visa through which they may seek to immigrate. See section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255; 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1, et seq. Furthermore, to the extent they are claiming prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, they have failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005) (observing that in addition to substantial, if not exact, compliance with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must also show prejudice). Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held that the failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to the deprivation of a liberty interest. Mejia-Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146-49 (11th Cir. 1999); Garcia v. Attorney General of the United States, 329 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir. 2003). Therefore, we find no reversible error in the denial of an additional continuance and the holding that the respondents have abandoned any application for relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, appeals the Immigration Judge’s August 22, 2008, decision denying his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s finding that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal due to his conviction of an aggravated felony.¿FN1º We are not convinced by the respondent’s assertion that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony because his crime was not a “crime of violence.” Regardless of whether it is a crime of violence, the crime of which the respondent was convicted, a violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d), unambiguously falls within the definition of an “aggravated felony” as defined in section 101(a)(43)(E)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(E)(iii),¿FN2º and we will give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).
 
We also see no evidence in the record to support the respondent’s assertion that his attorney “conspired with the Immigration Judge and Government Attorney under the color of State law in violation Sixth Amendment ¿sicº of the United States Constitution” (Brief at 3). To the extent that the respondent is making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that he has failed to comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Finally, we see no merit to the respondent’s argument of lack of jurisdiction where it appears that the respondent mistakenly inserted information regarding another respondent’s case into his brief as the brief refers to another respondent’s name and a drug offense rather than a firearm offense (Brief at 3).
 
*2 Accordingly, we enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alec J. Niziolek
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal under section 240A(a); remand
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 10, 2008, decision determining that the respondent had abandoned his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel and requests an opportunity to properly present his claim and application(s) for relief from removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a motion for summary affirmance. The DHS’ motion will be denied. The respondent’s request to remand the record will be granted and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The record reveals that the respondent’s prior counsel initially failed to timely file an application for cancellation of removal, claiming computer errors and problems. See Tr. at 23-33. The respondent’s prior counsel was given a 2-month continuance and given another opportunity to properly prepare any applications for relief and he failed to timely file any such applications. A Declaration and Motion to Accept Late Filing were submitted to the Immigration Court, more than 1 week after the filing deadline, by the respondent’s prior counsel. The respondent’s prior counsel indicated that he had misread his notes and made mistakes and these errors resulted in the delayed filing. He also argued that the respondent should not be punished for employing him or punished for his (the attorney’s) conduct. The respondent has submitted evidence that he filed a formal complaint with the State Bar of Arizona pertaining to the conduct of his prior counsel. We find that ineffective assistance appears to be obvious from the face of the record in this case. See Hernandez-Mendoza v. Gonzales, 537 F.3d 976, 978-979 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding that failure to file a waiver application by the given filing deadline constituted prejudicial ineffective assistance that was obvious from the face of the record). Therefore, we find that a remand is warranted in order to allow the respondent an opportunity to pursue any relief available to him.
 
ORDER: Accordingly, the motion for summary affirmance, filed by the DHS is denied. The respondent’s motion to remand the record is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

Carmen A. Leal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The lead respondent (AXXX XXX XXX), and his wife (AXXX XXX XXX) and minor son (AXXX XXX XXX), the co-respondents, have appealed the Immigration Judge’s May 11, 2007, decision denying their motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind removal order. The respondents had previously been ordered removed in absentia based on their failure to appear at a December 4, 2006, hearing. The appeal will be sustained; the December 4, 2006, removal orders for all of the respondents will be rescinded; and the removal proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
We find that the respondents have shown exceptional circumstances for their failure to appear at the December 4, 2006, hearing. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), provides, in pertinent part, that an in absentia order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the removal order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. In this case, the respondents’ former counsel, Mr. Fred A. Kowalski, failed to notify the respondents of their December 4, 2006, hearing (see, e.g., I.J. at 7-9; Group Exh. 10A (Motion to Reopen), Tab B; Group Exh. 14A (Affidavits and Letter), Tabs A-C). Instead, in a letter dated November 15, 2006, Mr. Kowalski’s office erroneously indicated that a hearing had not been scheduled yet (see I.J. at 7-9; Group Exh. 14A, Tabs A-C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (holding that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)).¿FN1º We also find that the respondents have substantially complied with the Matter of Lozada procedural requirements. In doing so, we acknowledge that the exact scope and terms of the respondents’ agreement with Mr. Kowalski is somewhat unclear and that Mr. Kowalski was not the counsel of record during the respondents’ hearings before the Immigration Judge. However, the record indicates that it was understandable for the respondents to view Mr. Kowalski as their attorney in these proceedings because of the following actions of Mr. Kowalski’s office: entering into an agreement with the lead respondent regarding representation and the preparation of paperwork for a bond hearing; collecting a fee for these services; preparing paperwork for the bond hearing; entering into an agreement with local counsel¿FN2º to actually represent the respondents at the hearing; and continuing to communicate with the respondents and ultimately erroneously informing the lead respondent that the Immigration Court had yet to schedule a hearing date.¿FN3º
 
*2 Based on the totality of the circumstances, we find that the respondents have established exceptional circumstances for their failure to appear at the December 4, 2006, hearing. As a result, the respondents’ appeal will be sustained and the proceedings will be reopened and remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the respondents shall be provided with the opportunity to apply for a change of venue and for any applicable form of relief. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The December 4, 2006, removal orders for all of the respondents are rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The removal proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to Reopen
 
*1 This record was last before us on December 19, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen. On July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the record to the Board for consideration of whether the respondent “‘voluntarily’ failed to depart” in light of the Board’s decision in Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007). See Atamian v. Mukasey, No. 04-74711, filed July 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Board’s December 19, 2005, decision is vacated and the respondent’s appeal considered anew. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On March 11, 2004, the respondent appeared with attorney Seth Reszko, who appeared on behalf of attorney Rita Mahdessian. The respondent was granted voluntary departure until July 9, 2004, and waived appeal. The respondent, through attorney Rita Mahdessian, appealed the March 11, 2004, decision, and on August 20, 2004, this Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 
The respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider on September 17, 2004, claiming that his waiver of appeal was not knowing and intelligent, and claiming that his former attorney, Rita Mahdessian, ineffectively represented him. The motion to reconsider was denied by the Board on October 28, 2004, because the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), with regard to attorney Seth Reszko, who had actually appeared on his behalf on March 11, 2004. See BIA Decision of October 28, 2004, at 1 (“Reszko has not been informed of the charges, so his version of events has not been sought. This is particularly significant, where the pursuit of a lengthy voluntary departure period appears to have been a reasonable strategic action on the part of counsel in this case”), citing Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998). See also Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 92 (BIA 2007) (“¿Tºhe voluntary departure grant involves a quid pro quo arrangement between an alien and the ¿gºovernment …. In return for departing within the time afforded for voluntary departure, an alien avoids certain adverse consequences of a removal order”).
 
On November 15, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, asserting that the regulatory time bar for motions to reopen should be equitably tolled, because he did not know of Rita Mahdessian’s ineffective assistance of counsel until August 20, 2004, when the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He asserted that Ms. Mahdessian ineffectively represented him by advising him not to voluntarily depart pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order, and by filing a dilatory and frivolous appeal on his behalf, even though she was aware that he had waived appeal. He also noted his appeal was not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction until after his voluntary departure period had expired.
 
*2 On June 9, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, noting in relevant part that the respondent had been previously advised that he was required to depart by July 9, 2004, and that he had waived appeal. On appeal, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge gave him too much credit for understanding immigration law. The fact that he had waived appeal based on his attorney’s assurance that everything would be taken care of, and that he failed to depart based on his attorney’s assurances that a valid appeal had been filed, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel from two separate attorneys.
 
The record reflects that, at the time of the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2004, decision, the only relief for which the respondent was eligible was voluntary departure until July 9, 2004 (Tr. at 31). Although the respondent had potential eligibility for lawful permanent residence through his employer, he did not have that eligibility at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, there is no indication that attorney Seth Reszko, who represented him at that hearing, ineffectively represented him, or that he was prejudiced by any action of Mr. Reszko. The respondent applied for and received the only relief for which he was eligible at that time. Moreover, the respondent received the extraordinary relief of 120 days of voluntary departure in exchange for the agreement to waive appeal. As the respondent has not established that he would have been eligible for any other form of relief had he been permitted to appeal, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent had not established prejudice based on any action taken on his behalf by attorney Seth Reszko.
 
Turning to the respondent’s claim that attorney Rita Mahdessian ineffectively represented him by advising him not to voluntarily depart, and by filing a dilatory and frivolous appeal on his behalf, we find that he has essentially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, with regard to that claim. Moreover, the motion was filed within 90 days after August 20, 2004, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we would find that the respondent merits equitable tolling of the motions deadline based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Despite this finding, however, we decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte because the respondent is ineligible for any form of relief from removal based on his failure to depart prior to July 9, 2004, the date authorized for voluntary departure. See section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act. The Board lacks authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or other general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for his failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure. Moreover, the respondent does not qualify for the “voluntariness exception” to section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, because he was fully aware of the voluntary departure order and was physically able to depart within the time granted. Cf. Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007) (“An alien has not voluntarily failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(l) of the Act when the alien, through no fault of his or her own, was unaware of the voluntary departure order or was physically unable to depart within the time granted”). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on June 18, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996) and denied his motion to remand. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen¿FN1º in order to apply for adjustment of status pursuant to an approved immediate relative petition filed by his United States citizen daughter. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion does not meet the regulatory requirements for motions to reopen because he seeks reopening for the purpose of applying for discretionary relief for which he had an opportunity to apply at his hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s contention that these requirements should not apply to him because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends that his former counsel’s representation was deficient because she opted to forego a continuance to wait for the adjudication of an immediate relative petition in favor of a sooner opportunity to apply for an inadmissibility waiver. This appears to have been a strategic decision, and the respondent’s subsequent dissatisfaction with it is not grounds to reopen his removal proceedings (Tr. at 42). See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that the result would have been different if his counsel had accepted the continuance to wait for the adjudication of the immediate relative petition and subsequently apply for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s waiver of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion, which this Board reviewed de novo and affirmed. The respondent has not shown how the bases for the discretionary denial of the waiver would not have similarly applied to the exercise of discretion in the adjudication of his application for adjustment of status. Accordingly, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s representation. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We will therefore deny the motion.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jose A. Rivera-Ortiz
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In a decision on April 19, 2006, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as an alien who remained longer than permitted but found that the charge of removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act was not sustained. She also deemed the respondent’s application for adjustment of status abandoned due to her failure to file required supporting documents. On May 12, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent was not removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act. On May 17, 2006, the respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s finding that her application for adjustment of status was abandoned. Thereafter, the DHS withdrew its appeal and ultimately filed a response to the respondent’s appeal. In a decision on March 5, 2007, the Board dismissed “the appeal” based on the DHS’s withdrawal of its appeal without addressing the respondent’s appeal and reinstated a period of voluntary departure. The Board should not have issued a decision addressing the withdrawal of the appeal of DHS without addressing the pending appeal of the respondent. Under the circumstances, the Board will reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) and vacate our October 3, 2007, decision.
 
The appeals of the DHS and the respondent are again pending before the Board. The DHS has advised this Board that it no longer desires to pursue its appeal on the merits. We grant the DHS’s request to withdraw the appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4.
 
The record reveals that the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition filed by her United States citizen husband (Exh. 4). The respondent requests that the case be remanded to the Immigration Court as she believes that some supporting documentation was submitted to the Immigration Court but misfiled. She asserts that she requested that her appointment for fingerpints be rescheduled as she received the letter informing her of the appointment date after it had passed, but has had no response.
 
The respondent, who is pro se on appeal but was represented by counsel below, has not submitted copies of any documents which she claims were submitted in support of the application for adjustment of status but misfiled. She also has not submitted the letter (and envelope) with the appointment for fingerprints she claims she received late. She has not provided information from a messenger service showing that the packet of materials was sent by her former attorney. She also has not alleged that the absence of any supporting documentation in the file was due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 The regulations provide that if an application or supportive documentation is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992) (“The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them”). Failure to file necessary documentation or to meet security and biometric requirements also “constitutes abandonment of the application” unless the applicant demonstrates “good cause” for such failure. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(c).
 
At a hearing on January 19, 2006, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent until March 17, 2006, to provide evidence that the Form I-45 was mailed to Mesa, Texas, and scheduled the hearing on adjustment of status for April 18, 2006, instructing the respondent that all supporting evidence and witnesses would be necessary at that time (Tr. at 81-83). At the hearing in April 2006, counsel for the respondent indicated that some of the documents were submitted with a packet via messenger and that the appointment for fingerprints was received after the date had passed (Tr. at 100-105). The Immigration Judge expressed willingness to consider copies, but none were provided. The DHS also indicated that it had received no copies. By failing to timely file the supporting materials, the respondent waived the right to apply for adjustment of status before the Immigration Court.
 
Therefore, we find no error by the Immigration Judge in determining that the respondent had abandoned her adjustment application. The respondent’s motion for remand is denied. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: Proceedings are reopened under its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(a), and our October 3, 2007, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The DHS’s motion to withdraw its appeal is granted, and that appeal is no longer before us.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for remand is denied, and the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*3 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN RE: PETR POKORNY
File: AXXX XX1 078 - Buffalo, NY
November 7, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jennifer Oltarsh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on July 24, 2000, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen, but the Immigration Judge denied it on October 9, 2002. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of that decision on October 22, 2003. The instant motion to reopen was filed on June 27, 2008. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues in his motion that his former counsel was negligent in these proceedings by filing on his behalf a defective motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. He further argues that former counsel was derelict in his representation of him on appeal. He requests that these proceedings be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion was filed more than 90 days after the Board rendered its earlier decision. The motion is therefore untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Board may equitably toll the 90-day period to seek reopening if attorney negligence prevented an alien from complying with the deadline. An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence. Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267, 268 (2d Cir. 2006); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 127, 134-35. (2d Cir. 2000) (any equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf). See also Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2nd Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent indicates that he filed a complaint against his former counsel with the New York Bar Association in April 2003. Such demonstrates that the respondent was aware even prior to the Board’s rendering of its prior decision that his former counsel may have been negligent in his representation. It was thus incumbent on the respondent to stay informed of his immigration status and file a motion with the Board alleging ineffective assistance of counsel within 90 days of our prior order. The respondent did not do so until nearly five years had elapsed. His failure to do so indicates his lack of diligence shown in this matter. We will not equitably toll the period for seeking reopening. It was not proper for the respondent to wait until after the New York Bar Association adjudicated his complaint against his former counsel before seeking reopening with the Board. We further note that the respondent has provided no proof that he notified the Department of Homeland Security or the Immigration Court of his address when he moved prior to his hearing in 2000.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX1 649 - Miami, FL
November 7, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicomedes Suriel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle M. Odio
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent’s case was last before this Board on August 15, 2006, when we denied her motion to reconsider our denial of her motion to reopen. More than 2 years later, on September 22, 2008, she submitted the instant motion to reopen her removal proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. She also requests a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion exceeds both the time and number limitations for motions to reopen, and it is denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Jamaica. She previously sought reopening in 2005 based on her claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel in 1999, her divorce in 1999 from her prior husband who withdrew the visa petition filed on her behalf and accused her of entering their marriage for immigration fraud, her marriage in 2000, and a new visa petition filed on her behalf in 2000. We denied her motion as untimely. We found that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in whose jurisdiction the respondent’s case arises, stated that the motion to reopen period is “mandatory and jurisdictional.” See Abdi v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1149-50 (11th Cir. 2005); Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999). The respondent now seeks reopening based on ineffective assistance of former counsel whom she claims failed to advise her during her proceedings before the Immigration Judge that she was eligible under for cancellation of removal as a battered spouse in her former, allegedly fraudulent, marriage. See 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii). She states that ineffective assistance of counsel “creates extraordinary circumstances requiring relief from the negative immigration consequences resulting from inadequate representation.” See Motion at 5. She declares that both of her petitions for review before the Eleventh Circuit were denied, as was her petition for review before the United States Supreme Court.
 
An alien may file only one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i). There is an exception to the number limit for motions to reopen for applicants who qualify for relief from removal as a battered spouse. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iv). The respondent has not demonstrated that the exception applies to this motion. Moreover, as we previously stated, the time limit for motions to reopen in the jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit is “mandatory and jurisdictional.” See Abdi v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra; Anin v. Reno, supra. This Board could only reopen proceedings under its discretionary sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a). Such action is taken only in “exceptional situations,” which have not been demonstrated here. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (“the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). The respondent has failed to present new, previously unavailable evidence, or to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, her motion is denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.

File: AXXX XX3 175 - El Centro, CA
November 6, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on June 9, 2008, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2008, decision finding the respondent removable as an alien convicted of aggravated felonies as defined in sections 101(a)(43)(B) (drug trafficking) and (G) (theft offense, including receiving stolen property) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(B), (G), and ineligible for any form of relief from removal.
 
On September 18, 2008, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, filed a motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent claims that his former counsel, Mr. Joseph Mbacho, failed to properly represent him on appeal before the Immigration Judge and this Board. See Respondent’s Motion, Respondent’s letter to Mr. Mbacho. The respondent alleges that he discovered Mr. Mbacho’s ineffective assistance after seeking judicial review of our decision. See Respondent’s Motion at 4. We find that the respondent has exercised due diligence in pursuing his case. Therefore, we will consider the respondent’s motion on our own authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (“¿Tºhe Board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.”)
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent asserts that Mr. Mbacho failed to challenge the Immigration Judge’s finding that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, that he failed to employ the modified categorical approach, and that he failed to present the hardship the respondent would suffer if removed to Mexico due to his disabilities. See Respondent’s Motion at 4.
 
*2 We now consider whether the respondent has successfully presented an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. To successfully raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent must show that (1) counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence; and, (2) he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance, that is, that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged in the Notice to Appear that the respondent was convicted on April 19, 2001, in the Superior Court of California, County of Tulare, for the offense of possession for sale of methamphetamine, in violation of CAL. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 11378, and was removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony defined at section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act (Exh. 1). During the proceedings, the DHS alleged that the respondent was convicted on July 3, 2003, in the Superior Court of California, County of Tulare, for the offense of receiving stolen property in violation of CAL. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 496d(a), and was removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act.
 
The respondent, by and through counsel, admitted that he was convicted as alleged and conceded that he was removable as charged (Tr. at 14-18). The record also contains evidence proffered by the DHS regarding the respondent’s criminal convictions (Exhs. 2 and 3).¿FN1º The Immigration Judge acknowledged the respondent’s admissions and found him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal (I.J. at 4-6). On appeal, Mr. Mbacho argued that certain portions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, (“IIRIRA”) are unconstitutional.
 
We find that the respondent has not shown that Mr. Mbacho failed to perform with sufficient competence. The respondent does not assert that Mr. Mbacho’s legal strategy was unreasonable at the time of his removal hearing. The respondent does not claim that Mr. Mbacho made such admissions and concessions on his behalf without his permission. In addition, the record reveals that the Immigration Judge asked the respondent directly if he was convicted as alleged and the respondent answered in the affirmative each time (Tr. at 14-18). The respondent has not challenged or sought to retract his admissions and concessions.
 
In the appeal brief, Mr. Mbacho conceded that this Board has no authority to consider constitutional challenges to the laws we administer. See generally Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 30 (BLA 1989). But, by raising the argument, he preserved the issue for further review. Given the respondent’s admissions and concessions, he is statutorily barred from cancellation of removal. Therefore, there was no reason for Mr. Mbacho to develop an argument regarding the hardship he and his family would suffer if he was removed from the United States. The respondent has not specified any appellate argument that Mr. Macho failed to make.
 
*3 In sum, the respondent has simply failed to show that Mr. Mbacho’s representation was defective. Because the respondent has failed to show that Mr. Mbacho failed to perform with sufficient competence, he cannot successfully raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as untimely filed.

Because the respondent admitted the factual allegations and conceded his deportability under section 237 of the Act, it was unnecessary for the DHS to present a record of conviction or other documents admissible as evidence in proving a criminal conviction. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41, 1240.10(c).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board to terminate the removal proceedings. The motion will be denied, but the proceedings will be reopened on our own motion.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. The respondent entered the United States as an immigrant in August of 1988. The respondent was convicted on December 5, 1990, in a New York criminal court of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The respondent was convicted on August 25, 1997, in a Rhode Island criminal court of possession of a controlled substance (cocaine). In a November 19, 1998, decision the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and determined that he was not eligible for any relief from removal. In a May 26, 1999, decision the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on August 20, 2001, which the Board denied in a July 15, 2002, decision. The respondent filed the present motion on October 8, 2008.
 
We treat the respondent’s motion to terminate as a motion to reopen and terminate proceedings. The respondent’s motion is untimely and number barred.
 
We will, however, reopen proceedings on our own motion. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). We find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation. The respondent provides evidence that in an August 21, 2008, decision the criminal court vacated his August 25, 1997, conviction based on the ineffective assistance of counsel which he received. Under Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621, 624 (BIA 2003) (if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the alien no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A)), vacating the respondent’s conviction is given effect for immigration purposes.
 
The respondent remains removable based upon his December 5, 1990, controlled substance trafficking conviction.¿FN1º Assuming (for reopening purposes only, given the evidentiary deficiency in the record) the respondent pled guilty or nolo contendere to this offense, he is now eligible to apply for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995). See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(1) (an eligible alien (even in removal proceedings) may apply for section 212(c) relief, without regard to the amendment made by section 440(d) of AEDPA, with respect to a conviction if the alien pleaded guilty or nolo contendere and the alien’s plea agreement was made before April 24, 1996).¿FN2º
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to terminate is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Proceedings are ordered reopened on our own motion, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Morocco and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has filed a timely motion to reopen our August 29, 2008, final administrative removal order. The respondent alleges that he is entitled to reopening due to ineffective assistance of counsel by his former attorney, Ronald Denis. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
The respondent has not demonstrated substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Dakane v. United States Attorney Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (requiring an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel to show substantial compliance with Lozada). Although the respondent has demonstrated that he filed a generalized complaint against Denis with the Florida State Bar, he has not submitted an affidavit or similar evidence detailing the agreement that was entered into with Denis with respect to the actions to be taken in this case. Moreover, the respondent has not offered any evidence that he has advised Denis of his allegations and given him an opportunity to respond.
 
Further, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Denis’ alleged misconduct. See Dakane, supra, at 1274. In that regard, the respondent has not offered any evidence that would indicate that Denis could have obtained a vacatur of the 2007 cocaine conviction in the Palm Beach County, Florida, Circuit Court that renders the respondent removable before the Immigration Judge rendered his May 28, 2008, adverse decision in this case. The respondent retained Denis less than a month before the Immigration Judge rendered his decision. We further note that Denis did attempt to obtain a continuance of the appellate proceedings before the Board to pursue a collateral attack. And to the extent that the respondent challenges Denis’ failure to file a collateral attack after we issued our final decision, we take no cognizance of any ineffective assistance of counsel that occurs outside of our administrative proceedings. See generally Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973-75 (9th Cir. 2004) (persuasive authority rejecting ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims based on actions of counsel that caused an alien to be placed in removal proceedings), amended by 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005). Finally, any presumed prejudice that the respondent sustained from Denis’ decision to file a briefing waiver rather than an actual brief during his administrative appeal is rebutted due to the respondent’s failure to demonstrate or even address in his motion to reopen how Denis’ failure to file a brief would have changed our final removal order. See, Dakane, supra, at 1275. For the foregoing reasons, the motion to reopen is denied.¿FN1º

As a final matter, we note that the respondent has also appended to his motion to reopen an application for suspension of deportation under former section 244 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254 (1994). The respondent may not seek such relief, which was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (effective April 1, 1997). Moreover, the respondent does not presently appear to qualify for any other forms of relief from removal.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas J. Tarigo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria N. Bjornerud
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Lebanon files this appeal from the denial of his motion to reopen. In a decision dated August 15, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied reopening on the ground that the respondent failed to provide proof of his marriage to a United States citizen or an approved spousal visa petition (Form I-130) to pursue adjustment of status.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge additionally found that there was not any evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel, as claimed. The appeal will be dismissed. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent asserts on appeal that his case should have been reopened on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Brief on Appeal at 2. Specifically, the respondent states that his prior attorney, Mr. Clifford Levenson, failed to advise him and his wife that they could pursue adjustment of status. He now resubmits, among other things, a letter dated July 31, 2008, from his present counsel of record to attorney Levenson, informing him of the possibility that the respondent might file a State Bar complaint against him (Tab D). He also submits proof that on September 26, 2008, he married Ms. Ruthie Sakran, and an I-130 was filed on his behalf on October 7, 2008.
 
We find no error below by the Immigration Judge. First, according to the record, the respondent never presented evidence of his marriage to Ms. Sakran in support of his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge’s finding here was correct. On appeal, moreover, the respondent concedes that he did not actually marry Ms. Sakran until September 26, 2008, or over a month after the Immigration Judge denied his motion to reopen (Tab B). In evidence now put forth on appeal and in support of a remand, it is clear that the I-130 was not filed on behalf of the respondent until October 7, 2008, too. In sum, there was no marriage or I-130 to show prima facie eligibility for reopening.
 
Second, with respect to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we agree with the Immigration Judge that there was no evidentiary basis for it. The respondent failed to prove substantial compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent only submitted a copy of a letter from his present attorney, suggesting that a State Bar complaint might be filed against him. The attorney’s letter is insufficient under Matter of Lozada, supra, to prevail on a due process challenge. The respondent, moreover, has not demonstrated that he was actually prejudiced in light of the fact that he was not married to Ms. Sakran when he was represented by attorney Levenson. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.
 
*2 Apart from his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent is also seeking to remand the record based on evidence that he is now married to Ms. Sakran and an I-130 has been filed on his behalf. As the respondent has failed to offer evidence tending to establish the bona fides of his marriage, the motion to remand is denied. Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(l)(iii)(B) (2008).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of Status
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s April 4, 2007, decision denying her motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On June 16, 2006, the Immigration Judge found the respondent to be ineligible for adjustment of status. A copy of the memorandum of the decision was printed at the hearing and given to the respondent, and the respondent reserved appeal (Tr. at 12). At that time, the respondent was advised that any appeal would be due on July 17, 2006 (Tr. at 15). The respondent did not appeal.
 
On January 11, 2007, the respondent, through her attorney,¿FN1º filed a motion to reopen stating that the Immigration Judge’s order “was not communicated to Respondent or her attorney until the order was presented in chambers to the undersigned attorney on the 13th day of September 2006” (See Motion to Reopen received on January 11, 2007). The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely. The Immigration Judge further found that, even if the respondent had not learned of the June 16,2006, decision until September 13,2006, the respondent had failed to explain why she did not timely file her motion within 90 days after September 13, 2006 (I.J. Decision of April 4, 2007, at 6).
 
On appeal, the respondent again claims that she was not timely advised of the Immigration Judge’s June 16, 2006, decision. She further states that on September 13, 2006, the day she discovered that a decision had been rendered in her case, she paid her attorney to file an appeal. However, her attorney failed to do so, and she did not discover this failure until January 11, 2007, the day she filed the motion to reopen.
 
Upon our review of the record, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely, and that she has failed to establish that she did not receive notice of the Immigration Judge’s decision. As noted above, the record reflects that the respondent was advised orally of the Immigration Judge’s decision, and that she was advised of the date on which her appeal was due (Tr. at 12-15).
 
To the extent the respondent is claiming that the filing deadline for the original appeal, or for the motion, should be tolled based on ineffective assistance of counsel, she has failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX0 357 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jude Nelson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On April 9, 1999, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed after he failed to appear at a scheduled hearing. On July 18, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen filed on July 11, 2008, seeking adjustment of status. The motion claimed that the respondent failed to appear as a consequence of the ineffective assistance of counsel in that he was advised not to show up for the hearing by his former attorney, Mr. Paul T. Layton. In support, the motion proffered, inter alia, an unsigned, undated affidavit from the respondent, and an application for cancellation of removal (Form EOIR-42A) (Motion at Items 38, 39). The Immigration Judge properly denied this motion because the only evidence of any ineffective assistance of counsel was the respondent’s self-serving, unsigned affidavit. Furthermore, the respondent had failed to comply with both the substantive and procedural requirements for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s appeal of this denied motion will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent again claims he was advised that he should not appear at court for this final hearing because he would be detained and deported. The motion includes an affidavit dated October 8, 2008, and signed by the respondent. There is no explanation as to why this affidavit was not signed when it was submitted to the Immigration Judge. Therefore, this is new evidence proffered on appeal that we are unable to consider. Notwithstanding, there is nothing in the affidavit that would convince us that the Immigration Judge’s decision was erroneous even had the content of the affidavit been considered. The affidavit merely states, in pertinent part, that the respondent was told by his attorney not to attend the April 9, 1999, hearing before the Immigration Judge. The affidavit also states that the respondent was specifically told by the attorney to come to court without his wallet and with a small bag of clothes to have something to wear when he was deported. These are conflicting statements with regard to having been advised not to appear at all. The respondent does not deny that he received notice from the Immigration Judge of the hearing, or that he would have been able to attend. Even were this evidence corroborated, given the internal inconsistencies in affidavit, the claim is not sufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Furthermore, the Immigration Judge correctly noted that the respondent had failed to comply with the procedural requirements for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The explanation on appeal is essentially that the respondent was not familiar enough with law to comply is simply disingenuous, as ignorance of the law does not explain the nearly 9 year delay in filing the motion to reopen.
 
*2 Where, as here, the alien does not deny having received notice of the hearing, or claim that he was in federal or state custody, an order of removal entered in absentia or as a consequence of failing to appear may be rescinded “…only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances…” Sections 240(b)(5) and (e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b) and (e)(1). Although aliens raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled, they first must establish that 1) their constitutional right to due process was violated by the counsel’s conduct; and 2) that they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). The motion before the Immigration Judge has not established a due process violation, and also has not explained why it took nearly 9 years to discover the purported ineffective assistance and file this motion. The motion does not establish the requisite due diligence or prejudice that would warrant tolling of the time limit. See Id; Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2 nd Cir. 2005), citing U.S. v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2nd Cir. 2001); Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
The appeal also argues that the respondent is eligible for a waiver under the former section 212 (c) of the Act (1996). As this issue was not raised before the Immigration Judge, we do not have jurisdiction to address it on appeal. Nevertheless, we note that the filing deadline for a special motion to seek section 212(c) relief for aliens subject to a final order of removal was April 26, 2005. 8 C.F.R. §1003.44(h).
 
Insofar as the appeal may be understood to argue that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the request to reopen sua sponte was an abuse of discretion, we disagree. The motion does not establish an exceptional situation warranting the exercise of the discretionary authority to reopen these proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The motion before the Immigration Judge failed to establish an exception to the time and limitation on motions to reopen and was properly denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Accordingly, respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert M. Bell, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on February 6, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider a prior denial of a motion to reopen. We concluded that the Immigration Judge properly deemed the respondent’s cancellation of removal application abandoned for failing to timely file it with the court. On May 5, 2008, the respondent filed another motion to reopen, based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, which is untimely and number-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the motion does not fall within any of the regulatory exceptions to the time limitation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). Therefore, the motion will be denied.
 
The respondent acknowledges that the only available method for the Board to reopen this matter is through the exercise of our limited authority to reopen sua sponte, and he requests that we do so (Motion, at 11). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). However, we have held that the Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations,” and we are not persuaded that such circumstances present themselves in this instant case. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).¿FN1º Specifically, the respondent argues that his first attorney provided ineffective assistance by conceding removability at the November 19, 2003, hearing. However, the record reflects that the attorney in question, Miguel Mendizabal, withdrew as counsel on June 20, 2005. Thereafter, the respondent hired attorney Ivan Mercado, who filed a motion to reopen, a motion to reconsider., and an appeal on the respondent’s behalf, never once contesting the concession of removability. Inexplicably, however, the respondent has indicated that he is not filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Mercado, despite the fact that he failed to timely challenge the removability concession. Thus, given the respondent’s 5-year delay in contesting his removability charge, we find sua sponte reopening on this ground is not warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent does not specifically request that the filing deadline be “equitably tolled,” but rather that we reopen on our own motion. We note, in this regard, that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in which this case arises, has held that the motion to reopen period is “mandatory and jurisdictional,” and not subject to equitable tolling, even where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised. Abdiv. U.S. Att’y Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999) (concerning time limitation for motions to reopen in absentia orders).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lorty Fevry, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; section 212(h) waiver
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Haiti and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. He appeals the Immigration Judge’s May 16, 2007, order of removal and holding that he abandoned his application for a waiver under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) (I.J. at 1-2). The respondent has identified no error in the decision, instead claiming that his former attorney Nashid Sabir, Esquire provided him ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondent’s appeal satisfies the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). To prevail on his claim; he must further establish that his counsel’s performance “was deficient to the point that it impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing,” such that he was not reasonably able to present his case. Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 371 F.3d 771, 774-75 (11th Cir. 2004). However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held that the failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to the deprivation of a liberty interest. Mejia-Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146-49 (11th Cir. 1999) (concluding that waiver relief is so speculative and so much a matter of grace that “an attorney’s deficient representation does not deprive an alien of due process if the deficient representation merely prevents the alien from being eligible for suspension of deportation”). The court has further held that aliens do not enjoy a constitutionally protected liberty interest in obtaining a waiver of excludability under section 212(h) of the Act, as this is a purely discretionary form of relief. Garcia v. Attorney General of the United States, 329 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
Here, the respondent does not challenge the finding of removability, which is supported by conviction documents in the record (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 7). Rather, he claims that his former attorney prejudiced him by failing to file his applications for a section 212(h) waiver and cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), by the March 5, 2007, deadline established by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 9). Read in conjunction with the transcript, the respondent’s affidavit and an April 24, 2007, letter from Mr. Sabir’s office seem to establish that he caused the respondent to miss the March 5, 2007, filing deadline (Tr. at 9-14). Nevertheless, since a section 212(h) waiver and cancellation of removal are discretionary forms of relief, the respondent cannot show that this ineffective assistance deprived him of a constitutionally protected liberty interest under controlling Eleventh Circuit law. See Mejia-Rodriguez, supra; Garcia, supra. The cases cited by the respondent in his brief, arising within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, are not binding in this proceeding. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 401 (BIA 1991).

CHARGE:

APPLICATION: Remand; special rule cancellation of removal
 
In a decision dated December 5, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, removable as charged and granted him voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). In the respondent’s appellate brief, he submitted a motion to remand based on suffering ineffective assistance of counsel as he alleges that his former attorney, due to a mistaken belief, failed to submit an application for special rule cancellation of removal pursuant to section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (“NACARA”), Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193 (November 19, 1997) amended by, Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (December 2, 1997). After the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) submitted its brief-while stating that the respondent did not receive ineffective assistance as he is ineligible for the relief sought - the respondent filed a supplemental brief on August 16, 2007, in support of his appeal and again alleged that a remand is warranted due to his former counsel’s ineffective representation. We will grant the motion to remand.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent has identified no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that his Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) was withdrawn by the DHS on January 31, 2006, due to his criminal convictions (I.J. at 2, 4-5; Exh. 2). Further, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for administrative closure based on his renewed application for TPS (I.J. at 4-5). Although the Act allows an alien to assert his or her right to TPS in removal proceedings, the respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s findings that the DHS opposed administrative closure of the case or that the respondent is statutorily ineligible for such relief (I. J. at 4-5; Tr. at 21-23; Respondent’s Br. at 3). See Matter of Barrientos, 24 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 2007). Specifically, the respondent cannot demonstrate eligibility for TPS as the Act and regulations clearly indicate that he is precluded from such relief based on his misdemeanor convictions for petty theft under section 490.1 of the California Penal Code and hit and run/property damage under section 20002(a) of the California Vehicle Code in 2003 and 2004, respectively (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 22-23, 41-43, 52; Exhs. 2, 4, 5). See section 244(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(2)(B)(i); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1244.4(a) (stating that “¿aºn alien is ineligible for ¿ TPSº if” he or she “¿hºas been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors”) (emphasis added).
 
*2 The respondent’s main argument on appeal is that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceedings below as his former counsel, despite the respondent’s pleas, did not recognize his potential eligibility for special rule cancellation of removal under NACARA and also failed to apply for asylum (Respondent’s Br. at 1-9). Specifically, it appears that the respondent sought to apply for NACARA special rule cancellation of removal as a “child” of a NACARA beneficiary, which he identifies as either his mother or father as both were allegedly granted such relief on June 27, 2003, when he was 19 years-old and unmarried (Respondent’s Br. at 2, 6). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.61(a)(4); section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1). The DHS points out that the respondent, as an alien seeking special rule cancellation of removal under NACARA, is subject to the inadmissibility provision under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act due to his criminal offenses (DHS’s Br. at 2-3). In particular, the DHS argues that the respondent cannot seek an exception under section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii), as both of his convictions, as noted above, are crimes involving moral turpitude and he, consequently, is not eligible for the first provision of NACARA’s special rule cancellation of removal (DHS’s Br. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.66(b)(1); Matter of Garcia-Hernandez, 23 I&N Dec. 590, 595 (BIA 2003); see generally Reyes-Morales v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 937, 944 (8th Cir. 2006) (“An alien with two convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude, by contrast, does not qualify for the exception and is per se inadmissible under § 1182(a)(2)(A)”).
 
In light of the information provided by the respondent, we find that he has demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).¿FN1º We also find that the respondent established prejudice as it appears that the failure to pursue an application for special rule cancellation of removal under NACARA was due to his counsel’s mistaken belief that he was not eligible for such relief (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8). See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638. Particularly, the transcript indicates that the respondent expressed a desire to his former counsel, Mr. Beam, to apply for special rule cancellation of removal under NACARA during the December 5, 2006 hearing, but counsel ultimately opted not to submit an application in this regard after deciding that the respondent did not qualify for such relief (Respondent’s Br. at 3-4; Tr. at 24-28).¿FN2º Although Mr. Beam did not identify during the hearing the basis for the respondent’s ineligibility for the relief sought, his letter to the respondent’s current counsel expressed his opinion that the respondent was “approximately 8 months short of having the requisite 7 years ¿ofº continuous physical presence needed for … NACARA” because the respondent entered the United States in August 1999 and was served with the Notice to Appear in January 2006. See Mr. Beam’s August 1, 2007, letter at 2-3. As noted by the respondent, Mr. Beam’s position here reflects a misunderstanding of the manner in which the physical presence requirement is calculated (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8). See Matter of Garcia, 24 I&N Dec. 179 (BIA 2007) (holding that an application for special rule cancellation of removal is a continuing one, so an applicant can continue to accrue physical presence until the issuance of a final administrative decision). As the respondent is not ineligible for NACARA special rule cancellation of removal as the child of a NACARA beneficiary, we find that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s ineffective assistance. See Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858-59 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
*3 With respect to the DHS’s argument that the respondent is statutorily barred for the relief sought, we first note that it is undisputed that the respondent’s petty theft conviction under section 490.1 of the California Penal Code constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude. See Juarez v. Mukasey, 530 F.3d 1020, 1022 (9th Cir. 2008); United States v. Esparza-Ponce, 193 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir. 1999) (“In addition to … our own cases, every other circuit that has addressed the question in the context of the immigration laws has concluded that petty theft is a crime involving moral turpitude for purposes of those laws.). However, we agree with the respondent that the DHS has not provided any case law showing that a violation under California Vehicle Code section 20002(a) — which prohibits drivers who damage property from fleeing the scene of the incident without first notifying the owner of the property - constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude (Respondent’s Supp. Br. at 1-2; DHS’s Br. at 3). Also, we are unaware of any legal authority that finds such an offense to constitute a crime involving moral turpitude, and moreover, we do not find that conduct under this section refers to actions which are inherently vile, base, or depraved (Tr. at 42-43). See Cerezo v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 1163 (9th Cir. 2008); Matter of Fualaau, 21 I&N Dec. 475, 477 (BIA 1996); Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 1159, 1167 (9th Cir. 2006).¿FN3º
 
Therefore, while not clearly established by the respondent, it appears that his conviction for petty theft may fall within the “petty offense” exception in section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act as he has committed only one crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Garcia-Hernandez, supra, at 595. In particular, the petty offense exception requires that (1) the maximum penalty possible for the crime of conviction or which the alien admits having committed did not exceed 1 year of imprisonment, and (2) the alien was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months. See section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act; see also Garcia-Lopez v. Ashcroft, 334 F.3d 840 (9th Cir. 2003). As the respondent’s maximum possible penalty and actual sentence for his petty theft conviction did not exceed these threshold levels, he appears to be eligible for the petty offense exception (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 22-23, 41-42; Exh. 4). As such, his petty theft offense does not render him inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act or automatically preclude him from having the requisite good moral character for his requested relief. See Matter of Garcia-Hernandez, supra, at 593-595; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.66(b)(1); section 101(f)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(3); but see section 101(f) of the Act (providing that a person still may be found to lack good moral character even if he does not fit within one of the enumerated categories).
 
*4 In sum, while we find that this matter should be remanded based on the respondent’s fulfillment of the above requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to make any determination regarding the respondent’s eligibility for relief. Specifically, additional proceedings are necessary for further fact-finding and analysis of the respondent’s application for special rule cancellation of removal consistent with section 203 of NACARA and the implementing regulations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating that the Board “will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals”). On remand, the respondent should be given an opportunity to submit additional evidence and testimony establishing his compliance with the statutory requirements for special rule cancellation of removal, and that he merits such relief in discretion (Respondent’s Br. at 6). The respondent should also be afforded an opportunity to apply for any other form of relief for which he may qualify. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be granted and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements under Matter of Lozada, supra, by providing (1) an affidavit that described his agreement with his former counsel, (2) evidence that he informed such counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance, and (3) a complaint that was filed against such counsel to the California State Bar (Respondent’s Br. at 5).

We note that Mr. Beam — when asked by the Immigration Judge why he, despite being given two continuances previously, had not prepared an application for special rule cancellation of removal under NACARA — answered by stating, “I thought I had discussed all the issues throughly with the client, but I had not come across the Nacara ….” (Tr. at 24-25).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yaw Akuoko, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mele Moreno
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision, dated July 19, 2007, finding him removable as charged, based on his record of conviction, and concluding he had abandoned any applications for relief from removal, including a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), for failure to timely file them, and ordering his removal to Nigeria. The respondent requests an opportunity to apply for section 212(c) relief and asserts that his failure to timely file such an application before the Immigration Judge was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.
 
A failure to request relief in accordance with a schedule set by the Immigration Judge constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to file for such relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (2008) (stating that if an application is not filed within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed abandoned). The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979).
 
However, under the particular circumstances presented in this case, and upon consideration of the Immigration Judge’s decision and the record as a whole, we are persuaded that the failure of the respondent’s former counsel to timely file an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act (Form I-191) by the court imposed deadline constituted ineffective assistance of counsel on its face. It is apparent that the respondent had sought to provide former counsel with all necessary documentation in support of the Form I-191 prior to the deadline and that former counsel’s failure to file by the deadline was the result of a mistaken assumption on his part that he nonetheless needed more time to get a federal tax clearance as well as school records for the respondent’s son (Tr. at 24). In our view, an exercise of reasonable diligence would have revealed to former counsel the necessity of either filing the Form I-191 by the deadline or, at a minimum, timely requesting leave of court for an extension of the deadline. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has determined that “an alien in civil deportation proceedings, while not entitled to a Sixth Amendment right to counsel, has the constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause right to a fundamentally fair hearing to effective assistance of counsel where counsel has been obtained.” Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Garcia v. Attorney General of U.S., 329 F.3d 121 7, 1223 (11 th Cir. 1999) (citing Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir. 1999) (alien must show that counsel’s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged the ‘fundamental fairness’ of the hearing.”).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the respondent is prima facie eligible for a section 212(c) waiver (Tr. at 14) pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), and therefore the failure of his former counsel to submit an application for such relief or, at a minimum, timely requesting leave of court for an extension of the deadline, was highly prejudicial to the respondent’s interests. See Dakane v. United States Attorney Gen., supra, at 1274 (“¿pºrejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.”); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, (BIA 2003) (respondent must show that he was prejudiced by prior counsel’s conduct). It appears that the respondent, though new counsel, is actively seeking to comply in good faith with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Therefore, we conclude that the preservation of the respondent’s due process right to a fair immigration hearing necessitates that the record be remanded to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent’s application for section 212(c) relief may be considered on the merits. We express no opinion at this time as to whether the respondent merits such relief in the exercise of discretion.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for farther proceedings in accordance with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joan O. Pinnock, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; fair hearing
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2008, decision denying her motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the motion.
 
On November 8, 2007, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia when she and her attorney failed to appear at a scheduled hearing. On May 2, 2008, through alternate counsel, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of removal. On May 22, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen and rescind, finding that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(1).
 
On June 23, 2008, the respondent, though the above-named attorney, filed a motion based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against her former attorneys. On July 8, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the motion because she deemed it to be an untimely motion to reconsider, because the respondent did not identify any error of law or fact in the Immigration Judge’s May 22, 2008, decision, and because the respondent failed to comply with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
On July 9, 2008, the respondent submitted additional documentation in support of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In a letter, dated July 11, 2008, the Immigration Judge informed the respondent’s attorney that the additional information was received after a decision had been rendered. The Immigration Judge also informed the attorney, however, to advise her if the respondent wished the supplemental information to be considered as a “second motion to reconsider.” On July 15, 2008, the respondent moved the Immigration Judge to reconsider her decision in light of the additional evidence in support of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and on July 17, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as number-barred, stating that “¿tºhe fact that the Respondent may have subsequently complied with these (Lozada) procedural requirements will not remedy this fundamental defect.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). This appeal then followed.
 
An order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrated that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.24(b)(4)(ii). Ineffective assistance of counsel may support a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances. Borges v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 398, 408 (3rd Cir. 2005). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (“Court of Appeals”), in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has held that the deadline for filing a motion to reopen in absentia orders of removal is subject to equitable tolling, and has suggested that ineffective assistance of counsel is a possible basis for this equitable tolling. Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2005). In Luntungan v. Atty. Gen. of U.S., 449 F.3d 551, 557 (3rd Cir. 2006), however, the Court of Appeals found that equitable tolling did not apply to permit an alien to toll the numerical restrictions on motions to reopen and rescind in absentia orders of removal where the alien had already had a fair chance to have the ineffective assistance of counsel claim heard in a previous motion.
 
*2 Given the particular circumstances of this case, we find that the respondent was not given a fair chance to have the ineffective assistance of counsel claim heard. Although the respondent’s motions, denied on June 23, 2008, and July 15, 2008, were both characterized as motions to reconsider, we find them to have been in the nature of motions to reopen because both were based on new evidence that the respondent sought to proffer in support of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Cerna, 19 I&N Dec. 399, 402, n.2 (BIA 1991). Even though the Immigration Judge specifically requested that the respondent’s attorney advise her whether the respondent wished to have the evidence considered as a “second motion to reconsider,” and even though the Immigration Judge acknowledged that the evidence pertained to the respondent’s compliance with the Lozada requirements, the Immigration Judge denied the “second motion to reconsider” as number-barred without considering the merits of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We find, therefore, that equitable tolling of the time and number restrictions imposed on motions to reopen in absentia orders of removal should be tolled in the instant case. Cf Luntungan v. Atty. Gen. of U.S., supra. Accordingly, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen in light of the additional evidence in support of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Guadagno, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 21, 2007, when we denied the respondent’s motions to reconsider our October 18, 2007, order denying his motion to reopen, and to reopen proceedings. The respondent sought review by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Court). On July 11, 2008, the Court effectively vacated our December 21, 2007, order, and remanded the case to us to reconsider the respondent’s motions to reconsider and reopen in light of Matter of Cruz-Garda, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999). The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response. The respondent’s motion to reconsider will be granted and the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
Deportation proceedings in this case were instituted against the respondent by the issuance and service of the charging document prior to June 13, 1992. Thus, the case is governed by the provisions of former section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Under former section 242(b) of the Act, and consistent with Matter of Cruz-Garvia, supra, the time and numerical limitations for filing of motions to reopen under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii) are inapplicable. Consequently, the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings, which was filed on September 21, 2007, and which claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, was not barred by time or numerical limitations. Our October 18, 2007, order denied, inter alia, the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely, also finding that no exception to a timely filing had been demonstrated. As such, to the extent our October 18, 2007, order denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely, it was erroneous.
 
Nonetheless, we find that the respondent’s September 21, 2007, motion to reopen proceedings (as well as his subsequent, November 16, 2007, motion to reopen) and to rescind the in absentia order of deportation which was entered against him on May 8, 1991, should be denied for lack of merit. Specifically, consistent with Matter of Cruz-Garvia, supra, a respondent seeking reopening of deportation proceedings and rescission of an in absentia order of deportation must demonstrate that his failure to appear at the hearing was due to a “reasonable cause.” We held, in Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, that a “reasonable cause” for failing to appear, if involving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, can be demonstrated if the respondent meets the requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Matter of Lozada, supra, has been followed by the Court in this jurisdiction. See Jian Yun Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
*2 In this case, the respondent contends that he failed to appear at his hearing on May 8, 1991, because his then-attorney informed him to come to his office rather than to the Immigration Court on the appointed date and time. The respondent followed his attorney’s directions and, because the attorney himself was late, the respondent and his attorney appeared in court late, after the Immigration Judge had already entered the in absentia order of deportation and had left the courtroom. However, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was considered, evaluated, and rejected by our February 12, 1992, order. The respondent submitted, since the February 12, 1992, order, an affidavit from his then counsel, dated November 12, 2007, confirming the truth of the content of the notice of appeal which he filed with us in May 1991, and, at the same time, stating that he did not have an independent recollection of the pertinent facts. The respondent also submitted his own affidavit indicating that the Immigration Judge did not want to see him when he arrived at the hearing on May 8, 1991, that his attorney did not inform him of his right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s May 8, 1991, order or of his right to file a motion to reopen, and that he did not sign the notice of appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 8, 1991, order. No other evidence has been submitted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, such as a State Bar complaint against the offending attorney or an explanation why such complaint could not be filed.
 
Overall, the evidence which has been submitted in support of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim consists of the aforementioned affidavits from the respondent and his former attorney, and a restatement of the respondent’s claim that his failure to appear in time for his hearing was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel (which, as indicated above, was considered and rejected by our February 12, 1992, order). However, as we noted in our February 12, 1992, order, and as it remains true to date, no affidavits have been submitted in support of the contention that the respondent was only an hour late for his hearing, and that such lateness was due to a “reasonable cause.” Thus, the evidence which has been submitted in support of the respondent’s motion is insufficient to demonstrate that the respondent failed to appear for his May 8, 1991, hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jian Yun Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 47; Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110-111 (2d Cir. 1993).
 
Finally, we note that the respondent suggested in his September 21, 2007, motion to reopen and reconsider that the Board lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 8, 1991, decision ordering him deported in absentia, and that he did not authorize his then-attorney to file a notice of appeal from that decision with the Board. The respondent suggested that the proper course of action was for him to file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge and, should the motion be denied, to appeal that decision to the Board. The respondent contends that the aforementioned deficiency was prejudicial and deprived him of his right to due process. However, consistent with Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, in proceedings under former section 242(b) of the Act, as is the case here, the Board had the authority to consider direct appeals from an Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of deportation. Id., at 645. Moreover, we find nothing in the record to support the respondent’s contention that he did not intend to file an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 8, 1991, order. In view of the foregoing, the following orders shall be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider the Board’s October 18, 2007, order is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s October 18, 2007, order is vacated to the extent it denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings is denied.

IN RE: TERRY WASHINGTON SMALL
File: AXXX XX8 108 - New York, NY
October 9, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peri B. Edelman, Esquire
*1 APPLICATION: Termination; voluntary departure
 
The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 25, 2006, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged and denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
The record establishes that the respondent is a lawful permanent resident of the United States who attempted to return to this country in 2004 after a trip abroad. The respondent was charged as seeking admission to the United States under section 101(a)(13)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(13)(C). Under that section a lawful permanent resident of the United States is not regarded as seeking admission into the United States for purposes of immigration law unless he falls within one of six categories. One of the six categories is aliens who have “committed an offense identified in section 212(a)(2), unless since such offense the alien has been granted relief under section 212(h) or 240A(a).” See section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act. Once an alien arriving in the United States as a returning lawful permanent resident demonstrates a colorable claim to lawful permanent resident status, the Department of Homeland Security bears the burden of establishing that one of the exceptions at section 101(a)(13)(C) of the Act applies to the alien. See Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. 749, 754 (BIA 1988) (relating to the government’s burden of proving abandonment of permanent resident status by the alien).
 
The respondent was charged in the Notice to Appear with having convictions dated June 5, 2002, for petty larceny in violation of N.Y. Penal Law § 155.25, and for reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law § 120.20. The respondent was further charged with being inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), for having been convicted of, or having committed, a crime involving moral turpitude.
 
After granting a number of continuances, the Immigration Judge denied a motion by the respondent’s counsel for another continuance so that the respondent could attempt to have his conviction or convictions vacated (Tr. at 41-42). The Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal and further found that any applications for relief had been abandoned. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Jamaica.
 
On appeal, the respondent correctly argues that no findings were made as to whether his crime involving moral turpitude falls within the petty offense exception found at section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). To benefit from the petty offense exception, the respondent must have been convicted of only one crime involving moral turpitude. Furthermore, the maximum penalty possible for the crime must not exceed imprisonment for 1 year, and the respondent must not have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months. See section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act.
 
*2 The respondent argues that his offense falls within the petty offense exception and that proceedings should, therefore, be terminated. He contends that he has been convicted of only one crime involving moral turpitude, petty larceny, and argues that his reckless endangerment offense is not a crime involving moral turpitude. He further states that the maximum penalty for petty larceny is less than 1 year.
 
The record before us contains no criminal records relating to the respondent. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge made no findings as to whether the respondent had just one crime involving moral turpitude or more than one. Under these circumstances, we are not able to affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent is subject to removal as charged. Accordingly, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and for the submission of evidence relevant to the respondent’s removability.¿FN1º
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the Immigration Judge’s decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s November 9, 2007, denial of his motion to reopen. We find it appropriate to remand this matter for further consideration of the respondent’s motion, and specifically for further fact-finding with regard to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and whether he has been prejudiced by counsel’s performance.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in September 1993. Current counsel has represented the respondent in these removal proceedings since May 2006 (Form EOIR-28, filed May 18, 2006). On July 3, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable on the initial charge (Exh. 1), but not on the subsequently lodged charge (Exh. 10), and found that he had abandoned any relief from removal for failure to file any application by the deadlines set by the Court. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the proceedings. In conjunction with the motion to reopen, counsel submitted an affidavit acknowledging that she missed the filing deadline for the respondent’s applications for relief from removal because she failed to calendar the re-set due date. She also acknowledged that she misplaced the respondent’s file for another two months before filing the motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen based on deficiencies in that motion, and did not reach the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). In particular, he found that the adjustment application was not accompanied by required proof of biometrics and affidavit of support, that the respondent’s statement was suspect because it was solely in the English language (whereas the respondent is Spanish-speaking), and that there was no prima facie showing of eligibility for any waivers of the respondent’s inadmissibility.
 
*2 Ineffective assistance of counsel in this case seems apparent from the record, and thus a failure to satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), would not necessarily preclude the respondent from pursuing this claim.¿FN1º Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000). Counsel acknowledges her failure to file the applications on time because she failed to calendar the new due date. The Immigration Judge also denied the motion entirely due to counsel’s failure to properly prepare and support the motion, in accordance with regulatory requirements. Moreover, we point out that counsel has continued to represent the respondent on appeal, and that she has failed to file a brief in support of the appeal, despite being granted an extension of the briefing deadline. The Board, however, has limited ability to engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The Immigration Judge in this case did not make any findings of fact regarding ineffective assistance of counsel or whether the respondent was prejudiced, including specific findings with regard to any convictions and whether such convictions render him inadmissible or otherwise ineligible for relief. Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand this matter for further consideration of the motion to reopen, and encourage the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to supplement his motion on remand. Accordingly, the record is remanded.

IN RE: ARSHAD MAHMOOD
File: AXXX XX3 241 - Baltimore, MD
October 3, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On June 16, 2008, the respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status based on his approved immigrant visa petition filed pursuant to section 203(b)(3)(A)(i) (skilled workers) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(3)(A)(i). Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our decision.
 
The respondent acknowledges that an immigrant visa is not immediately available. He asks this Board to reopen and remand the case to the Immigration Judge to hold the case in abeyance pending visa availability due to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he claims that had it not been for the ineffective assistance of prior counsel, Rubina Wadhwa, he would have filed his adjustment application when visas were available in July 2007. The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We will not reopen based on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the respondent was not represented before the Immigration Judge and this Board, by Ms. Wadhwa, but by Richard W. Moore, Jr. The Immigration Judge, not the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), had jurisdiction over the respondent’s adjustment application. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(I)(i) (in the case of an alien (other than an arriving alien) placed in removal proceedings, the Immigration Judge has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate an alien’s adjustment application). We recognize that Ms. Wadhwa incorrectly filed the respondent’s adjustment application with DHS, but she was not representing the respondent in removal proceedings. Mr. Moore, who represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge and this Board, was aware that the respondent was pursuing an employment based adjustment application (Tr. at 23-27; Moore letter to the Board dated August 27, 2007). If there is ineffective assistance on the part of Ms. Wadhwa, it did not fall within the ambit of these proceedings.
 
We will also deny the motion because the respondent has failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(a). First, an immigrant visa is not immediately available. According to the documentation provided, the respondent’s priority date is May 17, 2006. The current cut-off date for skilled workers is January 1, 2005. See Department of State Visa Bulletin for October 2008. Second, the respondent is statutorily barred from adjustment under section 245(c)(7) of the Act, as an alien who seeks adjustment of status under section 203(b) of the Act and is not in valid nonimmigrant status. Third, the respondent has not established his eligibility for adjustment under former section 245(i) of the Act.
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL & MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Defelice, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mele Moreno
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 6, 2008, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on May 12, 2005. The respondent has also filed a notice of motion to reopen with additional evidence. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
On appeal, the respondent acknowledges that he received the Notice to Appear, but he contends that he never received a notice of hearing indicating the date, place and time of the hearing. The respondent indicates that he is submitting a copy of an affidavit from his attorney at that time, John Eluwa.¿FN1º The respondent asserts that there is sufficient evidence to show that the notice of the hearing, even if mailed by the government, was never received by the respondent or Mr. Eluwu. He indicates that a visa petition has been filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse.
 
The respondent acknowledges receipt of the Notice to Appear, which was sent to the respondent on April 22, 2004, to his address in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Notice to Appear informed the respondent of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 of any change of address or telephone number during the course of his proceedings; he will be provided with a copy of this form; notices of hearing will be mailed to this address; if a Form EOIR-33 is not submitted and the respondent does not otherwise provide an address at which he may be reached during proceedings, then the Government is not required to provide respondent with written notice of his hearing. Exh. 1.
 
The record reflects that on September 29, 2004, a notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s address in Raleigh, North Carolina, setting forth the date of his hearing on May 12, 2005. Furthermore, on January 11, 2005, Elihu S. Massel, Esquire, filed a motion to change venue, a change of address form (Form EOIR-33) for the respondent, and a Notice of Entry or Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28). In the motion to change venue, Mr. Massel acknowledged that the respondent was scheduled for a master calendar hearing on May 12, 2005, at 9:00 a.m., in Atlanta, Georgia, but the respondent sought a change of venue to Newark, New Jersey, since he was residing with his family in New Jersey. On May 11, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to change venue. The respondent failed to appear for the hearing on May 32, 2005, and he was ordered removed in absentia.
 
The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). In his affidavit submitted with the motion to reopen, the respondent avers that he did not know that his hearing was scheduled for May 12, 2005. He indicates that his New York attorney was seeking to transfer the case to Newark, New Jersey, where he was living. The respondent states that it was not until after May 12, 2005, that Mr. Massel advised him that his request to change venue had never been granted. As correctly noted by the Immigration Judge, the notice of hearing was sent to the respondent on September 29, 2004, more than three months before the change of address form was filed with the Atlanta Immigration Court on January 11, 2005. If the respondent moved prior to September 29, 2004, he does not explain why he did not submit a change of address to the Immigration Court earlier. The notice of hearing was correctly sent to the most recent address he had provided. See Dominguez v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002). Moreover, the motion to change venue filed by Mr. Massel acknowledges that the hearing was scheduled for May 12, 2005, at 9:00 a.m. in Atlanta, Georgia. The respondent has not explained how Mr. Massel was aware of the court date, yet he himself was not aware of it. The respondent fails to state exactly when Mr. Massel advised him that his request to change venue had not been granted, and he does not indicate what steps he took, if any, to determine the status of his removal proceedings prior to filing the motion to reopen in June 2008.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear at the hearing, nor has he complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Matter of Lozada, supra, requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 514 F.3d 1224 (llth Cir. 2008) (aliens satisfied the procedural requirements and substantively alleged their attorney told them not to attend the hearing). The filing of a motion to change venue does not excuse the appearance at court, and the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. An attorney’s failure to advise a client that a change of venue motion had not been granted and that he must appear for the hearing is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with Lozada.
 
On appeal, the respondent also filed a notice of motion to reopen. The respondent has submitted additional evidence with the motion and with his appellate brief, but he has provided no persuasive explanation why such evidence was not previously available to him. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). The record supports the finding that the respondent had notice of his hearing, and he has not alleged or established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion to reopen is denied.

Mr. Eluwu states that he represented the respondent and his ex-wife regarding an alien relative immigrant visa and an application for adjustment of status, and that the Notice to Appear was the only notice received by the respondent. He acknowledges that the respondent never retained him to represent him in the removal proceeding, and their attorney-client relationship terminated after service of the Notice to Appear.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated April 08, 2008. On April 8, 2008, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of motions to reopen after an in absentia order of removal. In so doing, we found it unnecessary to address whether the respondent was the victim of attorney negligence in the untimely filing of the initial motion to reopen, noting that even had the motion been timely filed the respondent was unable to establish that an exceptional circumstance prevented his appearance at the hearing.
 
On July 25, 2008, we denied as untimely filed the respondent’s first motion to reconsider our decision. On August 13, 2008, the respondent filed the current motion to reconsider our decision on the merits, to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded.
 
The respondent’s current motion to reconsider of our April 8, 2008, decision is untimely as it was not filed within 30 days of the decision’s issuance and is barred as a second motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondent concedes that his motions to reconsider have been untimely filed, but requests that the current motion be considered on the merits as he is a pro se detained alien who believes he was the victim of prior ineffective assistance of counsel and did not intend to miss his appearance before the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied as untimely and number barred. Separate and apart from our denial of the motion as untimely and number barred, had we considered the current motion to reconsider on the merits, we would have found no legal or factual defect in our decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). In our decision on the merits, we agreed with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s assertion that he wrote an incorrect court date in his calendar did not establish exceptional circumstances to reopen the in absentia order. There was no need to address, and thus no error in the Board’s failure to address, equitable tolling of the time limit on motions to reopen where, as here, had the motion to reopen been timely filed by the respondent’s attorney, the respondent could not establish that reopening was warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jerry A. Beatmann
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before this Board on August 1, 2008, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen. On August 18, 2008, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our August 1, 2008, decision. The respondent requests reconsideration of our denial of his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1), a motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. The respondent claims that we erred in denying his motion to reopen which was based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent contends that he complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We agree. However, our prior decision did not deny the respondent’s motion to reopen based on his failure to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Our prior decision found that the respondent failed to make a prima facie showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). The respondent contends that we inappropriately required that the Alabama State Bar take appropriate action against his prior counsel to find ineffective assistance. We disagree. We did not require that the Alabama State Bar take disciplinary action against the respondent’s prior attorney. We observed that the fact that Alabama State Bar did not find that the respondent’s prior attorney engaged in misconduct appeared to negate the respondent’s claim that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance.¿FN1º In other words, the respondent did not show that his prior counsel’s conduct was deficient.
 
Furthermore, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also requires that the respondent establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his prior counsel’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. The respondent contends that he suffered prejudice due to his prior attorney’s misconduct because he was unable to present his case. Specifically, the respondent contends that his prior attorney erred in conceding at the hearing that the respondent was removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). Section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act provides that an alien who has been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude is removable from the United States. Section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act renders the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act (barring aliens convicted of an offense under section 237(a)(2) of the Act from eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act).
 
*2 The respondent is unable to establish that he was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s concession of removability because he has not made a prima facie showing on appeal that he was not removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. In 1999, the respondent was convicted of trafficking in counterfeit goods in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2320 and given 3 years’ probation (Exh. 3). In 2006, the respondent was again convicted of one count of fraud and false statements in connection with filing and preparing false tax returns and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment (Exh. 2). The respondent contends that this conviction is not a crime involving moral turpitude. However, he cites no case law to support his argument. We are not persuaded that the respondent’s convictions are not crimes involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Kochlani, 24 I&N Dec. 128 (BIA 2007) (the offense of trafficking in counterfeit goods or services in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2320 (2000) is a crime involving moral turpitude); see generally Matter of B-, 5 I&N Dec. 649 (BIA 1954) (a conviction for unlawfully attempting to evade payment of taxes imposed by the Canadian Excise Tax Act is a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude). Therefore, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s concession of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. Based on the foregoing, we find no error of fact or law in our prior decision denying his motion to reopen and will deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
June Y.I. Ito
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 A final order was issued by the Board in this case on June 18, 2008. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that his previous counsel erred in failing to apply on his behalf for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). The respondent, a native and citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia, has been convicted of crimes rendering him removable from the United States. The respondent argues that he need not apply for adjustment of status in conjunction with his waiver request. See Matter of Abosi, 24 I&N Dec. 204 (BIA 2007). Nonetheless, we find no error on the part of previous counsel or in the decision of the Immigration Judge, as a waiver of inadmissibility under 212(h) of the Act is not available to the respondent.
 
Section 212(h) of the Act is available to “an immigrant who is the spouse, parent son or daughter of a citizen … or lawful permanent resident.” Section 212(h)(1)(B)of the Act (emphasis added). The respondent wishes to use this waiver of inadmissibility in conjunction with his status under the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985, between the United States and Micronesia. See Compact of Free Association Act of 1985, Title II, § 201, P.L. 99-239, 99 Stat. 1770 (1986)(hereafter “the Compact of Free Association” or “the Compact”). The pertinent provisions of the Compact of Free Association state:
Any ¿citizen of Micronesiaº may enter into, lawfully engage in occupation, and establish residence as a nonimmigrant in the United States and its territories and possessions without regard to paragraphs (14), (20) and (26) of section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(14), (20), and (26) (requiring valid labor certification, an immigrant visa, or a nonimmigrant visa for entry)….
 
Section 141(a) of the Compact (emphasis added).
 
The Compact further provides that:
¿Sºection 141(a) does not confer on a citizen of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia the right to establish the residence necessary for naturalization under the Immigration and Nationality Act, or to petition for benefits for alien relatives under that Act. Section 141(a), however, shall not prevent a citizen of the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia from otherwise acquiring such rights or lawful permanent resident alien status in the United States.
 
*2 Section 141(c) of the Compact.
 
We find that, as section 141(a) of the Compact of Free Association is limited to nonimmigrants and section 212(h) of the Act is only available to immigrants, the respondent does not qualify for the requested relief. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence E. Rushton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 29, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 7, 2006. On July 29, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent alleges that her former counsel failed to raise, in the appeal to the Board, the Immigration’s Judge’s discretionary denial of a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), or the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of voluntary departure. The respondent alleges in her motion that she was unaware that these issues were not raised before the Board. The respondent also alleges that her former attorney failed to cite to controlling case law regarding the respondent’s application for a waiver under section 212(k) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(k).
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final decision in this matter. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Furthermore, the respondent has not established that her motion falls within any exception to the general filing requirements for motions to reopen. Although the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel in her motion, she has failed to establish that the time period for filing motions to reopen should be equitably tolled. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the circuit in which this case originates, has not specifically found that equitable tolling may apply to motions to reopen based upon claims of ineffective assistance in immigration cases. However, even assuming that the respondent could benefit from the equitable tolling doctrine, the respondent would have to establish that she exercised due diligence in learning of the alleged ineffective assistance and presenting her claim. See generally Pacheco v. Rice, 966 F.2d 904, 906-07 (5th Cir. 1992) (noting in a Title VII case, that equitable tolling imposes a “requirement of diligent inquiry” on the party seeking this sort of relief).
 
The respondent has not established that she exercised the required due diligence. The respondent has submitted only a copy of her statement to the Texas Bar, as part of a grievance, in which she alleged that her former attorney did not keep her informed of the progress of her case, including if and when her appeal was filed or the details of the decision (Mot. at 9). In his response to her allegations, the respondent’s former attorney stated:
*2 Finally, Ms. Mushtaq’s allegations that she was not informed on the status of her case are patently false. She had numerous consultations during the course of my representation at George R. Willy, P.C. Once the BIA dismissed her appeal, she retained the firm to file a petition for review. She was provided a copy of all decisions and correspondence from the government and from the courts.¿FN1º
 
The respondent has not filed any statement disputing the facts as set out in her former attorney’s response. Moreover, the respondent has made no allegations about her efforts to keep informed about her case so as to establish due diligence in learning of any ineffective representation. Accordingly, she has not established that the time period for filing her motion to reopen should be tolled.
 
Additionally, we observe that the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance relate to her applications for waivers under sections 212(k) and 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act and her application for voluntary departure. Each of these is a discretionary form of relief. Under the controlling law of the Fifth Circuit, an alien does not have a due process right to effective assistance of counsel in obtaining discretionary relief. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
Finally, we find no basis for reopening this matter sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board’s discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases in which exceptional circumstances are demonstrated).
 
For these reasons, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary Elizabeth Delli-Pizzi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David H. Burke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an October 9, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia deportation order that was entered on July 12, 1991, under former section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (which applies when service, or attempted service, of the notice of hearing, is made prior to June 13, 1992). See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
As we noted in our June 11, 2007, remand order, although the respondent’s motion was filed 13 years after the entry of the in absentia order, there is no time limit to file a motion for purposes of rescinding an in absentia order under former section 242(b) of the Act. Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999); Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998). Therefore, the DHS’s arguments on appeal regarding equitable tolling and the lack of due diligence are not relevant to our consideration of the respondent’s case.
 
Furthermore, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, except as noted herein. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent argues that his former attorney never notified him of the July 9, 1991, hearing date, even though the attorney was aware of his address (Tab 2, Respondent’s affidavit).
 
Although the respondent filed a bar complaint against the former attorney and notified the attorney of the allegations, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s affidavit does not satisfy the standard established in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). That case requires that the respondent submit an affidavit “setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” However, the respondent’s affidavit states only that the attorney “clearly had my address in Chicago when he received the notices from the Court. He had filed a Motion for Bond Redetermination on my behalf, and listed my address in Chicago on those forms” (Aff. at 1). That motion was filed on May 29, 1991, and listed the respondent’s address as “2514 4th Central Park Avenue” in Chicago. However, upon his release from custody on June 5, 1991. only 7 days later, the respondent’s address is listed as “4826 N. Merrimac” on all of the bond paperwork, the same as the obligor (Tab B). Thus, at the time that the Notice of Hearing was issued on June 13, 1991, the most recent address in the record for the respondent was different from the one which he claims was correct. However, the respondent’s affidavit fails to provide any details as to when he gave the attorney his address, how long he resided there, or why a different address was listed on official documentation only a week later. The respondent argues that it is not his burden to provide such details. However, it is his burden to submit sufficient evidence from which we can determine that counsel was ineffective in failing to notify him of the hearing. Although the respondent’s current attorney argues that there is no evidence that the respondent personally provided the “Merrimac” address, and that even if he did, no notice was ever received at that address (Br. at 12), the respondent himself has never made any such assertions. See Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998) (statements made by counsel in a brief or motion are not considered evidence and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight).
 
*2 The respondent also argues that it was improper for the Immigration Judge to accept DHS’s representation that the Central Park address provided by the respondent does not exist. However, the respondent has never denied or disproved that assertion. Morever, even if the Immigration Judge erred in this regard, such error was harmless, as we still uphold the finding that the affidavit was deficient under Matter of Lozada, supra. Furthermore, because we uphold the Immigration Judge’s finding that the evidentiary requirements of Lozada have not been met, we need not address the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by former counsel’s actions.
 
Moreover, we find no merit to the argument that the superceding Order to Show Cause (OSC) was not served on the respondent (Br. at 14), as the document itself reflects on its face that it was served on the respondent on May 24, 1991 (Form I-221S, “OSC”, Exh. 1). We also reject the respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction over his motion because he did not “reopen” proceedings upon remand (Br. at 12-13). Reopening was not necessary, as our June 11, 2007, order vacated our prior decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. Finally, given our disposition of this case, the respondent’s challenge to the denial of his motion to change venue is moot. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: DION RHOAN MCPHERSON
File: AXXX XX6 600 - Buffalo, NY
September 18, 2008
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joan O. Pinnock, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam N. Greenway
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated June 17, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for his failure to appear for a hearing on June 18, 1992. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondent states that he has been a lawful permanent resident since November 14, 1986. The respondent contends that he failed to appear for his hearing due to exceptional circumstances, as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel and because he was recovering from a gunshot wound at the time. He claims that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent indicates that he was not aware of the deportation order against him until he was arrested by the Department of Homeland Security. He has submitted an affidavit on appeal.
 
Initially, we note that the deportation proceedings were conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). Pursuant to Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993), section 242(b) applies “where an in absentia order is made in exclusion proceedings, or in deportation proceedings following service or attempted service of the notice of a hearing, for which the alien failed to appear, made prior to June 13, 1992, the effective date for the procedures specified in section 242B of the Act.” As service of the hearing notice in the instant matter occurred prior to June 13, 1992, section 242(b) of the Act is applicable in this case. Consequently, the Immigration Judge incorrectly applied the “exceptional circumstances” standard for the respondent’s failure to appear. See I.J. Dec. dated June 17, 2008, at 3-4. The applicable standard is “reasonable cause.”
 
We find that the respondent’s motion to reopen was timely filed. We have determined that the applicable regulations do not contain any time or numerical limitations on aliens who wish to file a motion to reopen to vacate an underlying order of deportation entered pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. See Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155, 1157 (BIA 1999); 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii). We reached the same result in the context of exclusion proceedings. See Matter of N-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 590 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998) (discussing the timeliness of motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Act).
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent contended in his motion that he never received any notice from his former attorney, and he assumed that his attorney handled his case and that no further appearance was necessary. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute “reasonable cause” where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). However, the respondent has not complied with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
As previously discussed, section 242(b) applies when service, or attempted service of the notice of hearing, is made prior to June 13, 1992. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, supra. The applicable notice of hearing is dated March 25, 1992. Therefore, the respondent need only establish “reasonable cause” for his failure to appear. See Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, at 1158 (the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) applies only to deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(Supp. II 1990)). The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The Supplementary Information to this regulation explained that the Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but that it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500, 501 (BIA 2008); 67 Fed. Reg. At 54,888-89 (Supplementary Information). Therefore, in light of the Immigration Judge’s failure to apply the correct standard of “reasonable cause,” we find that a remand to the Immigration Judge is warranted for a specific finding on this issue. See Matter of Peugnet, 20 I&N Dec. 233 (BIA 1991); Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. § 242.1(c)(1990). Accordingly, the record will be remanded.
 
*3 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald O’Hare
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit challenging the Board’s November 9, 2006, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of relief. In reviewing the respondent’s petition, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the Immigration Judge, and this Board, erred in essentially finding that the respondent had terminated or abandoned her course of studies pursuant to section 214(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1184(m), and was, therefore, inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(G), and ineligible for adjustment of status. As such, the court granted the respondent’s petition for review, and remanded the case for further consideration. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has expressed its nonopposition to a remand of the proceedings.
 
In light of the Board’s limited fact-finding authority, we find it appropriate to remand the record for further proceedings to provide the Immigration Judge an opportunity to consider the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status in light of the Tenth Circuit’s noted findings.¿FN1º On remand, both parties should be afforded an opportunity to submit relevant evidence and argument. If deemed necessary, the Immigration Judge may hold further proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

Melissa N. Henke, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
George W. Maugans
Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. Alleging ineffective assistance of his former counsel, the respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2007, decision finding the respondent removable as charged and ordering the respondent removed to Mexico, and requests a remand. The respondent has complied with the guidelines described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1stCir. 1988), and asserts that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance both during the respondent’s bond proceeding and during the respondent’s February 9, 2007, removal hearing. The record is remanded.¿FN1 º
 
As an initial matter, with respect to the issue relating to the bond proceeding, we note that bond proceedings are required by regulation to be separate and apart from removal proceedings. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.19(d); see also Matter of P-C-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 432(BIA 1991); Matter of Balderas, 20 I&N Dec. 389 (BIA 1991). As a result, we will not consider the issues relating to the respondent’s bond proceedings in this appeal from the removal order.
 
Turning to the merits of the appeal, the respondent contends that his former attorney was ineffective because she admitted the allegations and conceded to the charge of removability contained in the Notice to Appear when she planned to and did eventually argue that such evidence should be suppressed as a product of the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) egregious conduct pursuant to the exclusionary rule (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 2; Exh. 1). In addition, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge improperly relied on documents that were submitted only in connection with his bond proceedings. In the alternative, the respondent appears to assert that, if the records were indeed submitted in connection with his removal hearing, such submission further demonstrates his former counsel’s deficient performance.
 
The record reveals that at the respondent’s February 9, 2007, removal hearing, the Immigration Judge believed that the respondent’s case “was involved in a suppression type case.” (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 2). However, no motion to suppress had been filed in the respondent’s case at that time. Instead, as the Immigration Judge noted, the record reveals that on February 7, 2007, two days prior to the respondent’s removal hearing, documents evidencing the respondent’s alienage and manner of entry into this country, which had previously been filed in connection with the respondent’s bond hearing, had been re-filed with the Immigration Court (I.J. at 2; Exh. 3). The record further reveals that when the Immigration Judge informed the parties that he had received such documents, the respondent’s former counsel did not object or indicate in any way that she did not file such documents in connection with the respondent’s removal hearing. Rather, the respondent’s former counsel admitted the allegations and conceded to the charge of removability (Tr. at 2).¿FN2º A motion to suppress was ultimately filed on February 22, 2007 (Exh. 4). On April 11, 2007, noting that the respondent had already conceded to the charge of removability and that the record contains independent evidence of the respondent’s alienage and manner of entry that had been submitted by the respondent’s counsel, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to suppress, found the respondent removable as charged, and ordered the respondent removed to Mexico (I.J, at 2-3; Tr. at 7-15).
 
*2 At the outset, we find that, for the reasons identified by the Immigration Judge, the Immigration Judge committed no error in relying on both the respondent’s concession to the charge of removability and the documents supplied by respondent’s former counsel in finding the respondent removable as charged at the February 9, 2007, hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”); see also see also Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (recognizing that the exclusionary rule has no application where the government learned of the evidence from an independent source) (citations omitted). However, notwithstanding the propriety of the Immigration Judge’s actions, it is clear that the respondent’s former attorney’s actions prejudiced the respondent. See Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); but see Afanwi v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 788, 796-799 (4th Cir. 2008) (finding no constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment to effective assistance of retained counsel in a removal proceeding). Even the Immigration Judge recognized as much (Tr. at 8-9,13-15). Under the circumstances, we find that a remand is appropriate for further proceedings on the issue of the respondent’s removability.

The respondent’s appellate fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3)(2008). However, his request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). Likewise, as we find this matter inappropriate for three member review, the respondent’s request for such review is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(6).

The transcript of those proceedings in no way supports the respondent’s claim on appeal that his former counsel informed the Immigration Judge that she “was not prepared, that she had not consulted with her client, and that to require her to continue with the hearing at that time would force her to provide ineffective assistance of counsel.” (Resp. Br. at 7). Nor does it support the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge “pushed” the respondent’s former counsel to admit or deny the allegations in the Notice to Appear. Indeed, the respondent’s former counsel indicated that the respondent received the Notice to Appear and understood the nature of the proceedings and his rights (Tr. at 2).

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º-Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Ivory Coast, was admitted for permanent residence in New York on a conditional basis on July 20, 2001, based upon her marriage to Vincent Amiah (I.J. at 1; Notice to Appear at 1). The respondent’s status was subsequently terminated because the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) determined that her marriage was not entered into in good faith; and she was placed in removal proceedings (id.). On September 24, 2007, the respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 31, 2007, decision, affirming the denial of the respondent’s I-751 petition for review of conditions. While this appeal was pending, the respondent filed a motion to reopen,¿FN1º based on the alleged ineffective assistance of her prior counsel in not applying for cancellation of removal on her behalf. DHS opposes both the appeal and the motion. For the reasons set out below, the appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s appeal is summarily dismissed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1 (d)(2)(i)(A), (E), and 1003.3(b). The respondent has failed to provide statements in the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) that meaningfully apprise the Board of the specific factual or legal reasons underlying the challenges to the Immigration Judge’s August 31, 2007, decision. See Matter of Lodge, 19 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 1987); Matter of Valencia, 19 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1986). For questions of law, supporting authority must be cited, and for questions of fact, the specific facts contested must be identified. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003. 1(d)(2)(i)(A), 1003.3(b); see Valencia, supra, at 355-56. However, in the Notice of Appeal, the respondent fails to cite supporting legal authority or identify specific contested facts. Moreover, the respondent checked the block on the Notice of Appeal indicating that a separate written brief or statement would be filed in support of the appeal. This block is immediately followed by a clear warning that the appeal may be subject to summary dismissal if the appellant indicates that such a brief or statement will be filed and, within the time set for filing, fails to file the brief or statement and does not reasonably explain such failure. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). The respondent was granted the opportunity to submit a brief or statement in support of the appeal. However, the record indicates that the respondent did not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain the failure to do so, within the time set for filing. Accordingly, the appeal is summarily dismissed under the provisions noted above and we next address the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 A motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that an alien suffered prejudice. Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). “Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” Id. (citations omitted). However, as pointed out by DHS (DHS Opp. Mot. Br. at 7-8), the respondent cannot establish prejudice because she claims that her previous attorney erred in not pursuing cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, a purely discretionary form of relief. See Majia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1148-49 (11th Cir. 1999) (finding that an alien cannot demonstrate prejudice based on ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to a purely discretionary form of relief, such as suspension of deportation); Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney General, 321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir. 2003) (stating that cancellation of removal is a discretionary form of relief).
 
Moreover, we also agree with DHS that the respondent is not prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal because she lacks the requisite good moral character, see section 240A(b)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(B), based on her fraudulent marriage for immigration purposes (see I.J. at 6; DHS Opp. Mot. Br. at 12-14). See, e.g., Fisher v. INS, 79 F.3d 955, 965 (9th Cir. 1996) (finding that alien lacked good moral character because of sham marriage).¿FN2º In fact, the respondent’s former counsel seems to indicate that he did not pursue cancellation of removal, in part, for this very reason (see former counsel’s response letter, dated June 5, 2008, at 2-3). See Henyard v. McDonough, 459 F.3d 1217, 1244 (11th Cir. 2006) (stating that counsel’s strategic decisions cannot support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed.

We shall treat the respondent’s motion to reopen as a motion to remand because we had not yet rendered a final decision at the time the respondent filed her motion. However, a motion to remand is generally subject to the same requirements as a motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1), (c)(4); see also Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976, 978 (BIA 1999) (indicating that a motion to reopen filed during the pendency of an appeal may be styled as a motion to remand; however, in substance it remains a motion to reopen); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992).

We acknowledge that Fisher, supra, does not have precedential value, as the case at bar arises with the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989) (stating that the Board follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). However, we find this case instructive and we are unaware of published cases addressing this issue in the Eleventh Circuit.

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **
 
U.S. Department of Justice
Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ROSANNA ZICCA
File: AXXX XX9 162 - Chicago, IL
September 12, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark S. Kocol, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jessica Galassi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on March 2, 2004, at which time we affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 28, 2003. The respondent has moved to reopen the proceedings due to allegations of ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The motion will be granted; the Board’s March 2, 2004, order, will be vacated; and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings, and the entry of a new decision.
 
In a detailed brief supported by substantial documentation, the respondent has presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding Thomas Royce, her previous counsel.¿FN1º The motion fully complies with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 191 & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (copy of grievance complaint filed with the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, and their response indicating that they have initiated an inquiry into the matter; affidavit of respondent including, inter alia, a description of the work to be performed; and notification to prior counsel and his response thereto). The respondent has demonstrated that the actions of prior counsel effectively precluded her from presenting her claims for relief, and foreclosed the prospect of effectively pursuing an appellate challenge.¿FN2º Taken together, the evidence presents “egregious circumstances” and demonstrates that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of the actions of prior counsel, and warrants reopening of the proceedings. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Sanchez v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 641, 650 (7th Cir. 2007) (having found that counsel was ineffective, and that the record before the Immigration Judge (and thus the record that went to the BIA) was woefully incomplete, the court concluded that further proceedings are necessary so that the proper authorities can evaluate the legal claims and exercise their discretion on the basis of a presentation that is fair to the alien).
 
The Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to “exceptional circumstances.” See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). The Board has found that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to “exceptional circumstances.” See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). According to the respondent’s motion, prior counsel in this matter: (1) failed to prepare and timely file a promised application for cancellation of removal on behalf of the respondent despite having been granted an extension of the filing deadline by the Immigration Judge on several occasions; (2) failed to explain the import of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her application for cancellation of removal, as abandoned, directing her to provide him with a completed application and supporting documents, which she did, telling her that everything was going to be fine; (3) failed to advise and disclose to the respondent that he was filing an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to the Board, and noting that she did not sign the appeal forms submitted to the Board, despite the fact the appeal form contains what purports to be her “signature;” (4) failed to notify the respondent that he filed a brief in support of the appeal; (5) advising the respondent, in response to a “bag and baggage” letter she had received and faxed to him, not to report as directed by the DHS, indicating that everything was going to be alright and that he would file a habeas corpus petition with the federal court; (6) while her former counsel did file a habeas corpus petition with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, he never provided the respondent with a copy of the filing; (7) failed to advise and inform the respondent upon receiving a decision from the federal court denying habeas corpus petition for lack of prosecution; (8) failed to communicate any further with the respondent, and based on his previous representations, leading her to believe that everything was alright and that she was awaiting a rescheduling of her hearing.
 
*2 We note that included in the motion is her former counsel’s response, essentially confirming the respondent’s allegations. We consider, moreover, the respondent has presented evidence that her former counsel was suspended from practice for misconduct by the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, on 3 separate occasions, most recently on September 20, 2006, and there is no indication he has since been reinstated. Consequently, when considered in conjunction with the failures cited above, which include lying and failing to disclose critical and material facts to the respondent, we find that these rise to the level of “exceptional circumstances,” warranting a grant of the reopening of the proceedings, as a matter of discretion. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations); Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Ekimian v. INS, 303 F.3d 1153, 1156-60 (9th Cir. 2002) (acknowledging Board’s authority to reopen sua sponte is within its unfettered discretion).
 
We are not persuaded by the DHS’s arguments in opposition to the respondent’s motion. The DHS does not contest the respondent’s claim that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and does not dispute that the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s actions. Instead, the DHS argues the respondent’s motion should be dismissed as untimely and does not warrant “equitable tolling.” See Yuan Gao v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 376, 377 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting that the doctrine of “equitable tolling” creates a defense to statutes of limitations and other nonjurisdictional filing deadlines for cases in which, despite due diligence, the plaintiff cannot sue within the statutory deadline); see also Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488, 490 (7th Cir. 2005)(finding the 90-day deadline is a statute of limitations and therefore subject to equitable tolling).
 
However, the Seventh Circuit has determined that “the test for equitable tolling, both generally and in the immigration context, is not the length of the delay in filing the complaint or other pleading; it is whether the claimant could reasonably have been expected to have filed earlier.” See Pervaiz v. Gonzales, supra, at 490 (7th Cir. 2005); Williams v. Sims, 390 F.3d 958, 960 (7th Cir.2004); Shropshear v. Corporation Counsel, 275 F.3d 593, 595 (7 th Cir. 2001). In light of the issues raised in her motion and the letter in response to her allegations submitted by her former counsel,¿FN3º we consider that it was not unreasonable for the respondent not to have filed her motion earlier premised on her reliance on her former counsel’s continued reassurances; and that only upon her detention by DHS, did she become fully aware of the grievous consequences of her former counsel’s egregious conduct, and then acted diligently in submitting the instant motion, and has raised a prima facie claim for relief from removal. See Gaberov v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 590 (7th Cir. 2008) (court found that equitable tolling of the motions deadline was warranted despite the motion being filed 4 years late); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006) (alien must show that his situation warrants equitable tolling, which, in turn, requires a showing of due diligence); see also Pervaiz v. Gonzales, supra.
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion will be granted.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s March 2, 2004, order, is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has determined that “there is no constitutional ineffective-assistance doctrine” in removal proceedings, noting that aliens are entitled to due process, not “a right to good lawyering.” Magala v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 523, 525 (7th Cir. 2005). Nonetheless, the court found that ineffective assistance can constitute a valid ground for reopening. See Stroe v. I.N.S., 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988)).

2

We note, in this regard, the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case, wherein the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, as abandoned, for failure to timely submit the application for the requested relief, despite being afforded numerous opportunities to do so.

3

We consider, in this regard, that her former counsel admits that “in the process of handling ¿herº immigration matters … ¿heº reassured her on various occasions to such an extent that she did not understand how grave the consequences were for her (from the court as well as the INS),” and that the “quiet period with INS that extended from the time ¿heº submitted the habeas petition (it was dismissed on March 14, 2005, due to lack of prosecution which ¿heº failed to notify ¿herº of as well) may have caused her to believe that she was back in control of her case.” Her former counsel posits that this was reasonable on her part due to his failure to communicate otherwise with her.
