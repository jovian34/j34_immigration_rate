MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark Lee, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On February 29, 2012, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the June 25, 2010, decision in which the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had abandoned her application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), for failure to file the application in a timely manner. On June 5, 2012, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen in which she alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of her former attorney. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She has also offered evidence in support of an application for adjustment of status that reveals her prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status as the parent of a United States citizen at the time of the removal hearing. Upon consideration of the evidence before us, it appears that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of her former attorney’s handling of her case. Id. at 640.
 
Although the respondent’s motion is untimely by 6 days, in light of the particular circumstances present in this case, the Board will exercise its sua sponte authority and grant this unopposed motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the proceedings will be reopened and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, and for other action as may be deemed appropriate.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriel J. Marous, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On April 20, 2012, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent subject to removal, denying his request for a continuance, and ordering him removed from the United States. On May 14, 2012, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. He later supplemented the motion with additional evidence. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a reply to the motion and the motion is therefore deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3).1 The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge and on appeal to the Board and who also filed the visa petitions (Form I-130) for the respondent’s adult United States citizen son on behalf of the respondent. The respondent asserts that the former attorney mishandled the visa petition process, and that because of his former attorney’s errors, the petitions were denied, leading to the respondent’s inability to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent has submitted documents that he states would have supported the visa petitions. The respondent has also submitted evidence showing that his adult United States citizen daughter has recently filed a visa petition on his behalf. The respondent seeks adjustment of status, in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility, based on the pending visa petition.
 
Given the lack of opposition to reopening from the DHS, the timeliness of the motion, and the previously unavailable evidence that the respondent’s United States citizen daughter filed a Form I-130 on the respondent’s behalf after the respondent’s last hearing in this matter, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988).2 In light of our decision in this matter, we need not address whether the respondent has established that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Panzer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Vera Hochberg
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Jamaica. An in absentia order of removal was first entered against him on December 8, 2011. On December 21, 2011, the respondent filed a motion seeking to rescind the court’s order. The motion to reopen was denied, and a motion for reconsideration followed on January 3, 2012. On January 4, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied reconsideration. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s statement that he wanted his day in court and did not understand the last decision. Given the respondent’s statements, the Immigration Judge denied reconsideration. We agree with the denial. We acknowledge that when the respondent filed his last motion, he submitted a hand-written statement on his own because his attorney was out of the country. Nonetheless, his motion failed to address the issues in the Immigration Judge’s decision with which he took issue. The federal regulations provide that a motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). See also Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). As the respondent’s statements did not meet this standard, the respondent did not establish a sufficient basis to justify reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
We acknowledge that on appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge applied the wrong factors in evaluating the merits of his motion to reopen and he believes an in absentia order of removal was entered prematurely without affording him an opportunity to present any evidence (Br. at 2). These contentions relate to the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen-- arguments which more properly should have been advanced in the motion for reconsideration and not on appeal now. To the extent that the respondent also submits affidavits from family and friends and a letter written to his former attorney of record, Ms. Sharon Brown, to establish that he was not properly advised by Ms. Brown, these documents, again, should have been introduced earlier.1 We conclude that the respondent failed to establish a legal or factual basis for reconsideration by the Immigration Judge and specifically, as to the merits of the appeal, we agree with the government that this appeal is not an opportunity for the respondent to file new evidence or advance contentions that should have been made at a prior stage (DHS Br. at 3).
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Benjamin T. Wiesinger, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorely R. Fernandez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The pending motion to reopen, which seeks to reopen and rescind the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2005, decision ordering the respondent removed in absentia, is both untimely filed and number barred and has not been shown to satisfy any exception to the filing requirements imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7).
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable filing deadline based on the respondent’s alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel(s) claim. The respondent contends that former counsel(s) failed to properly pursue her alleged lack of notice of her hearing claim based on her assertion that the address listed on the Notice to Appear does not correctly reflect the address that she provided and, as a result, the notice of hearing was sent to the wrong address. However, the respondent’s claim is undermined by her husband’s affidavit wherein he indicates that the Notice to Appear reflects the address that was provided by the respondent (Submission of Respondent’s Additional Evidence dated December 15, 2011, at 4). Despite the respondent’s assertion that first former counsel forged her signature on the March 3, 2010, dated affidavit that was submitted along with her first motion to reopen that was filed before the Immigration Judge on April 15, 2010, she does not claim that subsequent counsel forged her husband’s signature. Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertion alone sufficient to demonstrate that the notice of hearing was sent to the wrong address. The respondent therefore has not sufficiently shown patent error or prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor has she substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against each of her former counsels. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Finally, the respondent, who does not dispute personal service of the Notice to Appear, has not provided a coherent and persuasive explanation for why she waited almost five years to file a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. Nor has she demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority.
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the fact that her motion is both untimely filed and number barred. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Venezuela. The Board dismissed his appeal on March 21, 2011, and denied a motion to reopen on April 25, 2012. The current motion was untimely filed on September 14, 2012, and is barred by numerical limitations on motions. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks to have the Board reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a). This action is taken only in “exceptional situations.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). This is not such an exceptional situation.
 
The respondent again makes a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge. We already considered the respondent’s claims against former counsel in our April 25, 2012, decision. His main claim against this attorney is that he failed to timely apply for withholding of removal before the Immigration Judge. As we stated in previously denying reopening, the respondent fails to show prejudice concerning this claim, DeZavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004), as he has not set forth any kind of persecution claim.
 
The respondent also now suggests that former counsel did not tell the Immigration Judge that he planned to marry and possibly seek adjustment of status on this basis. According to the respondent, he married on July 26, 2011. He also contends that his wife is asthmatic and will suffer hardship if he is removed. This is no basis for reopening of these proceedings, where there is nothing to suggest that the respondent’s wife has even filed a visa petition on his behalf.
 
The pending motion is, therefore denied, and the motion to change venue is denied as moot.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Brett Pouncey, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorraine L. Griffin
Assistant District Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision issued July 3, 2012, which found the respondent removable and denied his request for a continuance and for voluntary departure. The respondent has not filed a brief on appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response to the appeal requesting summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision; however, we do not find that summary affirmance would be appropriate in this case. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The factual findings of the Immigration Judge are reviewed to determine whether they are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). All other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges, including legal and discretionary determinations and applications of law to fact, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find no clear error in the factual findings of the Immigration Judge in this case. Upon de novo review of the questions of law, discretion, and judgment presented, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance and voluntary departure.
 
In particular, the respondent foiled to establish good cause for a continuance in his case, where a request for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion had already been denied by DHS, the respondent was believed to be affiliated with a gang, and his conviction had not been vacated and remained valid for immigration purposes (I.J. at 1-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355 (BIA 1983). Moreover, the respondent has failed to show prejudice in his case. To date he has not presented any evidence that he has been granted prosecutorial discretion or deferred action by DHS, that he is not affiliated with a gang, or that his conviction has been vacated.1
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that he was denied due process. The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the telephonic connection at the last hearing was poor (I.J. at 2-3), but following mailing of a transcript of all hearings to counsel for the respondent, he has not filed a brief or made any further arguments in this regard.2 The respondent received a full and fair hearing in this case (I.J. at 1-9; Tr. at 1-14).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly noted that the respondent chose not to pursue pre-conclusion voluntary departure because he was not willing to waive appeal, and then properly denied post-conclusion voluntary departure due to the respondent’s conviction within 5 years (I.J. at 8). See sections 240B(a) and (b), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a) and (b); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(b) and (c).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Leslie Snyder, Esquire
 
CHARGES:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)] - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of South Africa who adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident on March 16, 1999. On December 3, 2002, the respondent was placed in removal proceedings by the issuance of a Notice to Appear based on his convictions for burglary of an occupied dwelling and grand theft in the third degree under Fla. Stat. §§ 810.02(3)(a) and 812.014(2)(c), respectively. On February 11, 2005, an Immigration Judge entered an order of removal in absentia.
 
On April 19, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In the motion, the respondent argued that based on Matter of Alyazji, 25 I&N Dec. 397 (BIA 2011), he was not removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) for a crime involving moral turpitude because he committed the theft and burglary offenses more than 5 years after his 1990 admission. He also argued that he should be permitted to re-enter the United States as a lawful permanent resident because the Notice to Appear was improvidently issued. The Department of Homeland Security opposed the motion to reopen as untimely.
 
On May 17, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Relying on 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) and Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Immigration Judge concluded that she did not have jurisdiction to reopen the respondent’s in absentia order of removal because the respondent departed the United States. The respondent now appeals. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2012). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)(2012). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
*2 After the Immigration Judge issued her order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, decided Jian Le Lin v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 681 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir. 2012), in which the court disagreed with our holding in Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, supra. The court held that the regulatory departure bar, which prohibits the filing of a motion to reopen by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States, conflicts with the statutory right of an alien to file one motion to reopen. Jian Le Lin v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra, at 1239-41. See also section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d), 1003.23(b). Thus, under the controlling authority of the Eleventh Circuit, the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion to reopen, notwithstanding the respondent’s departure from the United States. Jian Le Lin v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989) (holding that the Board generally must follow circuit court precedent in cases arising in the circuit).
 
Nonetheless, we will affirm the denial of the motion to reopen on alternative grounds. A motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). A motion to reopen in an absentia removal order pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the hearing. Id.
 
The Immigration Judge entered the respondent’s in absentia removal order on February 11, 2005; the respondent filed his motion to reopen on April 19, 2011. The motion to reopen was untimely because the respondent filed it more than 180 days after the entry of the removal order. Further, the respondent does not allege, or establish, that his failure to appear was due to extraordinary circumstances as that term is defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). He also does not claim that he did not have notice of the February 11, 2005, hearing. Id. Indeed, the respondent’s motion to reopen indicates that his attorney appeared at the February 11, 2005, hearing although the respondent had already departed the United States (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2; Exh. 4). Based on the record before us, we conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia order of removal was untimely.
 
*3 The respondent states in his motion and on appeal that he relied on erroneous advice of counsel and departed the United States (Respondent’s Br. at 7; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2). To the extent that this statement may be construed as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
For these reasons we affirm the denial of the motion to reopen, albeit for reasons different from the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: BARBARA ROBINSON
File: AXXX XX2 823 - Buffalo, NY
October 5, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed an untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). She seeks equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance of one of her former counsel, Daniel Aidif, who did not file a motion to reopen prior to expiration of the time within which she had to voluntarily depart.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005). However, the respondent has not demonstrated a basis for equitable tolling as she has not shown prejudice. Vartelas v. Holder, 620 F.3d 108, 115 (2d Cir. 2010). That is, an alien claiming that she received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that counsel’s “performance was so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.” Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 485 (2d Cir. 2010)(citations omitted); Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent has not made this showing. The Immigration Judge entered the final administrative order in this case on August 5, 2003. The respondent did not enter into a contract with Mr. Aidif until November 17, 2003, which was after expiration of the 90 day period within which to file a timely motion to reopen. Therefore, Mr. Aidif could not have filed a timely motion to reopen or otherwise complied with Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002).
 
Further, the respondent has the burden to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence during the “entire” time she seeks to have tolled, which “includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). See also Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2007)(alien must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006)(“[N]o matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”).
 
*2 The respondent has not provided a sufficient explanation as to why she waited until 2012 to file the present motion regarding Mr. Aidif. The respondent has filed six previous motions, but she has not specifically alleged ineffective assistance as to Mr. Aidif, or otherwise satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, prior to this motion, even though the representation about which she complains occurred in 2003. Therefore, due diligence has not been demonstrated.1
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen shall be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We note that, hand-written on a Form EOIR-27 submitted with the present motion, the respondent also states that her “most recent lawyer, Andrew Rappeport,” did not present the new evidence in connection with a motion filed in 2011. However, no further explanation of this claim has been made, nor is there any evidence of Lozada compliance in connection with any claim against this attorney.

File: AXXX XX3 133 - Miami, FL
October 5, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karen M. Iezzi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before us on July 18, 2012, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered in his proceedings on January 15, 2008, and denied his subsequent motion to reopen. On August 17, 2012, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay will denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (providing that a motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority”); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Here, the respondent asserts that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s determination that his motion to reopen was time and number-barred (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 4-6). Specifically, the respondent asserts that his failure to appear for his hearing was due to both lack of notice and exceptional circumstances, i.e. ineffective assistance of a notario and thus, the time and number limits should be equitably tolled (Id.).
 
First, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this matter arises, does not recognize equitable tolling of the time period for the filing of motions to reopen where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has been made, but has held that the time period for filing motions to reopen is mandatory and jurisdictional. Ali Abdi v. U.S. Attorney General, 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005); Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999). Moreover, we are not persuaded by the cases the respondent’s relies upon outside of this jurisdiction, or the arguments relating to an unpublished decision from the Eleventh Circuit. Thus, the respondent’s motion convinces of us no error in our determination that his motion to reopen was both time and number-barred. To the extent the respondent raises additional issues regarding the Immigration Judge’s and Board’s decision, those issues should have been raised on appeal or in his subsequent motion to reopen. See O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied” and “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) (citation omitted). While the respondent may disagree with our prior decision, the motion does not provide any basis to conclude error in the Board’s ultimate decision. Accordingly, the motion and stay will be denied.1
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Al Kola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brendan Curran
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 19, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal convictions.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).2 The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a writ of habeas corpus to vacate it. The respondent has offered evidence of that with the appeal. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent continuances from March 2, 2012, until June 19, 2012, to allow the respondent to collaterally attack the conviction. The Immigration Judge declined to grant further continuance, noting that the writ was not filed until June 13, 2012.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).3 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
*2 While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel.

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerardo S. Gutierrez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lynn K. Hollander
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 6, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent alleged in his motion to reopen that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel or submit sufficient documentation supporting his claim that he is eligible to pursue cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (requiring that a motion to reopen be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents). Furthermore, we find no merit to the respondent’s arguments on appeal, where there is no evidence that a motion for a continuance was denied or that the respondent was ordered removed in absentia. In addition, the respondent has not presented any evidence demonstrating that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he is inadmissible to the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c) (placing the burden on the alien to establish that he is clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted to the United States). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: GUILLERMO ANTONIO CORTES FERNANDEZ A.K.A. GUERNO HERNANDEZ CORTEZ
File: AXXX XX0 965 - Los Angeles, CA
October 2, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James F. Kajtoch, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final order of removal in this matter was entered on June 3, 2010, when this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent not eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). On August 6, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion is untimely.
 
The respondent asserts, however, that his motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and a claim that equitable tolling applies. A motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. Prejudice results when the inadequate performance may have affected the outcome of the case. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785 (9th Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent has submitted evidence that after the Board’s decision was issued on June 3, 2010, he entered into an agreement with Michael J. Hernandez for the filing of a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Mot. at 1-3; Mot. Exh. A). The respondent has submitted a receipt showing that he paid the amount required for the filing (Mot. Exh. A). The respondent states that Mr. Hernandez advised him that the case would take a long time (Mot. at 2-3). The respondent reports that Mr. Hernandez did not file anything on the respondent’s behalf and that he was suspended from the practice of law by the Florida Bar at the time he entered into the agreement with the respondent to file the petition for review (Mot. at 2-3; Mot. Exh. B). The respondent also states that he now believes the attorney should have filed a motion to reconsider with the Board. The respondent reports that he has obtained the services of a criminal attorney, who specializes in post-conviction relief, to assist him with his criminal conviction, and that once the conviction is addressed, the respondent will be eligible for relief from removal. The respondent has submitted a copy of a visa petition (Form I-130) and evidence that his wife is a United States citizen (Mot. Exh. D).
 
*2 Accepting the respondent’s allegations concerning his former attorney, Michael J. Hernandez, it is extremely unfortunate that the respondent was apparently cheated out of a substantial amount of money. However, the respondent has not made any allegation that the result in his case might have been different if Mr. Hernandez had filed the promised petition for review, or in the alternative filed a motion to reconsider with the Board. It was determined during proceedings that the respondent was not eligible for the relief he sought, based on his controlled substance conviction. The respondent makes no challenge to the findings of the Board or the Immigration Judge. Thus, even though the Board may consider, as a matter of discretion, claims of ineffective assistance based on conduct that occurred after the final order of removal was entered, the respondent has not shown that this is a case that warrants reopening. See Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009).
 
To the extent the respondent speculates that his criminal conviction might be vacated in the future, this is not related to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and is not a basis for reopening. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992) (providing that motions to reopen must establish prima facie eligibility for relief).
 
Finally, the respondent has submitted a supplemental filing with evidence concerning his work-place injury on April 19, 2006. He states that the injury was the subject of a workers compensation claim. He also makes references to a “U Visa” application in relationship to the claim, but he does not explain how any such application would be a basis for reopening or how it would constitute an exception to the 90-day filing requirement.
 
The respondent has not established that his untimely motion to reopen should be granted, and the motion will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of the motion is moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George P. Mann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 6, 2011, when we affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 12, 2010, which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings.1 On January 4, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider our decision. The motion to reconsider will be granted and the appeal is dismissed. The request for refund of the motion fee is denied. The request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Iraq, seeks reconsideration by the Board of its December 6, 2011, decision. He alleges we erred in stating he did not submit an appellate brief and, with his motion to reconsider, he has provided a copy of a brief he submitted to the Board concerning his previous appeal. The brief is date stamped indicating that it was received timely by the Board, but it was not associated with the respondent’s record of proceeding. In our previous decision, we stated that no brief had been submitted, but we considered the arguments raised by the respondent previously in his motions to reopen and to reconsider filed with the Immigration Judge (BIA, Dec. 6, 2011, at 2).
 
A motion to reconsider is “a request that the Board reexamine its previous decision in light of additional arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.” Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Id. The motion must specify the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Thus, given that the respondent’s appellate brief was overlooked, we grant his motion to reconsider.
 
In his brief, the respondent argues that the previous order of removal entered in absentia should be rescinded. He argues that he has presented exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear as he was ineffectively served by previous counsel and suffered a panic attack concerning his appearance in Immigration Court. He also argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal and asylum based on changed country conditions in his native Iraq. After considering the arguments raised in the brief, we will again dismiss the appeal.
 
*2 We have reconsidered our December 6, 2011, decision based on the respondent’s appellate brief. We conclude that he has essentially presented the same arguments raised in his previous motions that we considered at the time of our previous decision. As we found previously, he has failed to support his arguments concerning any ineffective assistance of counsel during the earlier proceedings nor has he complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangley & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). Further, we continue to find that the respondent has failed to show that any anxiety or panic attacks he suffered due to his fear of removal present exceptional circumstances that excuse his failure to appear for his hearing. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998); see also Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 411 (6th Cir. 2003) (respondent bears burden of proof to show exceptional circumstances). The respondent’s perfunctory statements concerning his panic attacks, with no detail concerning the severity or evidence of treatment, fail to support his burden of showing exceptional circumstances. See Matter of J-P-, supra. As we are dismissing the appeal from the denial of the motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order and the respondent is currently not in the United States, he has not shown any eligibility for relief and the appeal will be dismissed. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose M. Guerrero, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 15, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by not finding that her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). According to the evidence in the record, the respondent relied on the advice of her counsel’s office that she did not need to appear for her scheduled hearing. Hence, we find that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, which prevented the respondent from attending her scheduled hearing before the Immigration Judge.
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has demonstrated that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with a hearing regarding her removability from the United States and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

Irwin J. Berowitz, Esquire1
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Georgia, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 4, 2012, denying his motion to reopen these removal proceedings which concluded with the respondent being ordered removed in absentia on August 31, 2011. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand.
 
The Department of Homeland Security has informed this Board that, on July 25, 2012, the respondent was removed from the United States. Given that the respondent was not subject to a stay of removal at that time, we conclude that the respondent’s removal from the United States resulted in the withdrawal of his appeal, and the initial decision of the Immigration Judge to deny the respondent’s motion is accordingly final to the same extent as though no appeal had been taken. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4; cf. section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(b)(5)(C) (providing that the filing of a motion to reopen, in some circumstances, shall stay the removal of the alien “pending disposition of the motion by the [I]mmigration [J]udge”); Matter of Diaz-Garcia, 25 I&N Dec. 794 (BIA 2012). The respondent’s removal also results in a withdrawal of his untimely and number-barred motion to remand. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d); Desai v. U.S. Att’y Gen., -- F.3d. --, No. 11-3229, 2012 WL 3570718 (3d Cir Aug. 21, 2012); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000).
 
Assuming, arguendo, that the respondent’s removal did not result in a withdrawal of his appeal and his motion to remand, we would affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision and deny the motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely as it was filed on April 17, 2012, approximately 230 days after he was ordered removed. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent’s motion to remand is also untimely and number-barred. See Matter of Oparah, supra. While the respondent does argue that his prior counsel was ineffective, he does not argue that the applicable time and number limits governing motions to reopen should be tolled on the basis of equitable grounds. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2005). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not, by itself, permit an alien to file a motion to reopen at any time and without regard to the number limits. In his untimely and number-barred motion to remand, the respondent does not pursue his claim that he did not receive notice of his removal hearing on August 31, 2011. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii). Instead, he acknowledges that, on June 10, 2011, he appeared before an Immigration Judge and that the Immigration Judge rescheduled these proceedings to August 31, 2011 (Respondent’s Affidavit at ¶ 13). Even if conditions in Georgia have changed since the respondent entered this country in 1999, he does not allege that conditions have materially changed since he was ordered removed in August 2011. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. We also conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation which would warrant sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Additionally, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that reopened proceedings are warranted as a matter of discretion. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988). The respondent, by his own admissions, was using controlled substances while his proceedings were pending before the Immigration Judge (Respondent’s Affidavit at ¶ 12). Even though the respondent, an alien who has not complied with the terms of his 1999 admission as a nonimmigrant, has referred to adjustment of status, cancellation of removal, asylum, and withholding of removal, the respondent has not presented persuasive evidence to establish that he is actually eligible for those forms of relief from removal. Considering that the respondent has already been removed from this country and the speculative likelihood that the respondent would be granted relief from removal, we also conclude that reopening is not warranted as a matter of discretion. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal and motion to remand are deemed withdrawn as a result of his removal from the United States and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Ines Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was most recently before us on June 19, 2012, when this Board denied the respondent’s previous untimely motion to reopen his removal proceedings. This motion was filed on July 17, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent characterizes this motion as a motion to reconsider the Board’s previous decision. A motion to reconsider is one which identifies a material error of fact or law in the decision for which reconsideration is being requested. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion does not identify any errors of fact or law in the prior decision. Instead, the motion seeks to introduce additional evidence in support of the respondent’s prior motion, which sought reopening based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, this motion is actually in the style of the respondent’s second, untimely motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent’s prior motion was denied because the untimeliness of the motion was not related to the ineffective assistance, because the respondent had not shown due diligence, because the respondent had not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and because the respondent had not included the documents which his prior attorney should ostensibly have submitted at the trial level. This motion is accompanied by the respondent’s affidavit and the evidence which he claims should have been submitted to the Immigration Judge. The affidavit generally states that the respondent “contacted [his] attorney at the time afterwards” and was “assured” that “he would have this matter reopened” (Motion, Tab A). He further states that after his prior attorney was “convicted” the respondent “saw many attorneys who told [him] that there was no possibility of re-opening” the case (Id). The respondent’s affidavit does not provide clear details regarding what transpired between the time of his final hearing on April 1, 2005, and the filing of his first motion with the Board on February 8, 2012.
 
These general, vague allegations do not persuade us that equitable tolling of the time and number limits is warranted. Alzaarir v. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011). As noted in the Board’s prior decision, the respondent was aware at the trial level that his attorney neglected to submit pertinent documents, and the respondent raised allegations of ineffective assistance through new counsel during the course of his appeal. The respondent has not meaningfully explained why he was unable to make a timely motion to reopen, or comply with Lozada’s procedural requirements during the course of his appeal. His claim that he “saw many attorneys” who refused to file a motion is undercut by his ability to gain new counsel for his appeal who filed a motion to remand which alleged ineffective assistance. We again conclude the respondent has not established that the ineffective assistance is tied to the untimeliness or number-barred nature of this motion, and that the respondent has not established due diligence. This motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicolas Chavez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 18, 2012, when we issued two separate decisions in these proceedings. First, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2011, decision as untimely and denied his motion to remand. Then, in a separate decision, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 5, 2012, decision denying his motion to reconsider. On July 17, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and reopen.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion is both a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent seeks reopening based on statements in his brief and previous motions and challenges the decisions of the Board and the Immigration Judge. Consequently, we shall treat the respondent’s motion as both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. The respondent’s motion is precluded by regulation, as a party “may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The motion therefore will be denied as barred by regulation. Additionally, even if we reached the merits of the motion, it essentially reiterates the arguments previously raised in the respondent’s motions and on appeal with regard to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of O-S-G-, supra (discussing regulatory requirement that a motion to reconsider specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
As a motion to reopen, it is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s final order of removal dated November 22, 2011. Sections 240(c)(7)(C)(i), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, a motion seeking reopening to reapply for adjustment of status does not fall within any exception to the time limitations on motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3) (setting forth exceptions to the time and number limits); see Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
*2 The respondent continues to assert that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and thus the time and numerical limitations on his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not squarely stated whether an alien has a constitutional right to effective counsel or whether equitable tolling would apply to motions raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it has nevertheless stated that an alien’s right to due process is violated when the representation he receives was so deficient it impinges on the fairness of the proceedings and the alien, as a result, suffers substantial prejudice. See Guitierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).
 
In support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent again submits the corroboratory evidence from his previous appeal and motions and also submits additional evidence of his compliance with the requirements laid out in Matter of Loazada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 2000). We note that among this evidence is a letter from the Texas Board of Disciplinary Appeals indicating that it dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the State Bar of Texas’s dismissal of his complaint against Mr. Michael Canton (see Motion to Reopen, Tab 4). The Texas’s State Bar determined that the conduct alleged by the respondent was not a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct (Id). Moreover, the additional evidence submitted by the respondent with this motion was considered by the Immigration Judge in his January 5, 2012, decision, wherein he determined that it would not have changed the outcome of the respondent’s case (see Decision of the Immigration Judge, dated January 5, 2012, at 3). As the respondent has not established prejudice as it relates to his applications for relief, he has not shown that equitable tolling of the time and number limitations is warranted.2
 
Furthermore, the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen his proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). While the respondent continues to argue that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not established prejudice from his prior counsel’s actions or inactions nor has he established prima facie eligibility for any relief given the Immigration Judge’s previous discretionary denial. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

We note that the respondent is not seeking reconsideration of the Board’s decision declining jurisdiction over his untimely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2011, decision.

Regarding equitable tolling in the immigration context, the Fifth Circuit has held that the Board’s exercise of such authority is akin to our exercise of authority in reopening a matter sua sponte, such that the Circuit Court does not have the jurisdiction to review alleged errors in the application of the doctrine. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas Jalaie, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board in 2005 when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying a previous motion to reopen these proceedings, in which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia in 2001. The respondent has filed another untimely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence that is material to the respondent’s claims. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Because the respondent has not submitted evidence with the motion, it will be denied for not complying with the regulatory requirements for motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Even if we considered the merits of the motion, it would be denied, as a motion to reopen is not an opportunity to repeat previously rejected arguments. See INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). Nor has the respondent meaningfully raised ineffective assistance of counsel, where he has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), or shown prejudice.
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation warranting the exercise of our discretion to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lena Golovnin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This is the respondent’s fifth motion before the Board and it will be denied as untimely and number barred. This case was last before the Board on February 29, 2012, when we denied the respondent’s untimely and number barred motion to reopen these removal proceedings. The final administrative order in these proceedings was entered on July 22, 2003, almost a decade ago. With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order, and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until June 15, 2012, and its supplemental filings on July 9 and September 12, 2012. The motion to reopen and its supplements are filed years out of time and are number-barred. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the time his appeal was dismissed by the Board in 2003. He asserts counsel failed to file a timely petition for review of our decision or a timely motion to reopen these proceedings. The respondent therefore claims he is entitled to equitable tolling of the filing deadline for a motion to reopen. However, even if the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel as required in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not demonstrated due diligence in his filing of the instant motion or his prior motions. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). The respondent has not explained his actions in waiting more than 9 years after the issuance of the final order, or even 3 years after his first untimely motion to reopen was denied by this Board, to file the ineffective assistance claim. Moreover, the respondent has not shown how he was prejudiced by prior counsel’s actions. The respondent has not established that he was not removable as charged, that he would be eligible to pursue adjustment of status in these proceedings, or that he did not have a fair hearing on his application for asylum, withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. In short, he has not shown that the outcome of these proceedings would be different but for the actions of prior counsel.
 
*2 The respondent also has not presented any evidence of changed country conditions in order to except him from the time and number restrictions in filing his motion to reopen.
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation that warrants our reopening sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and number-barred.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board when we returned the record to the Immigration Court, because we found that the respondent waived appeal through counsel. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering the respondent removed to Guyana became the final administrative order. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider our decision and reopen proceedings.1 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
A party seeking reconsideration requests that the Board’s original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent has not identified errors of fact or law in our prior decision. Instead, the respondent repeats the arguments he previously made to the Board. Compare Respondent’s Motion with Respondent’s Notice of Appeal, attached statement. We considered these arguments and found them unpersuasive before concluding that the respondent waived appeal through counsel. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal ....”). As we explained, ineffective assistance is not clear from the record, and the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for raising such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Nor, for reasons set forth, did his filing reflect circumstances that warranted review of the Immigration Judge’s decision by certification. Thus, while the respondent may disagree with our decision, he has presented no arguments that convince us of a factual or legal error, or an appellate argument that we overlooked.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will also be denied. Notwithstanding the respondent’s recent partial compliance with Matter of Lozada - filing a complaint with prior counsel’s state bar - the respondent has still not shown that counsel’s alleged deficient performance resulted in prejudice. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that an alien must show prejudice when he advances an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and that “[p]rejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different”). Neither the respondent’s present or previous filing included proffered evidence reflecting prima facie evidence of United States citizenship. Additionally, the respondent has presented no evidence that his criminal conviction underlying these proceedings has been overturned or that a state court has otherwise found ineffective assistance by the respondent’s defense counsel of the type in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). Finally, the respondent has not alleged or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for relief from removal.
 
*2 The respondent has submitted a photocopy of a portion of a detention center computer-based mailing log and submits that his notice of appeal would have been timely but for unspecified administrative errors within the detention center’s mailing system. However, even if the respondent had timely filed the Notice of Appeal, it would not impact our conclusion that he waived appeal through counsel. A respondent who waives appeal cannot thereafter file an appeal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) (final sentence), 1003.39.
 
Finally, we do not find an adequate basis for reconsidering our previous decision or reopening the case sua sponte. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Olu Jaiyebo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 1, 2011, denying his motion to reopen. An Immigration Judge previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on February 8, 2011. On appeal, the respondent maintains that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances, and he asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that reopening is warranted because he failed to appear for his hearing due to exceptional circumstances. See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). Upon de novo review, we find that the respondent’s contentions that he misunderstood his attorney’s directions regarding his obligation to appear at the hearing do not constitute exceptional circumstances within the meaning of section 240(e)(1) of the Act, when the respondent has not set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. To the extent the respondent contends that he did not appear because he was relying on a pending motion to continue that was not received by the Immigration Court until the day after his hearing, we note that parties are obligated to appear for a scheduled hearing unless and until the Immigration Judge expressly grants a request for a continuance. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (the filing of a motion for a continuance does not excuse an alien from failing to appear); Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988).
 
Furthermore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening of his proceedings is warranted. The respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation so as to justify a discretionary grant of his untimely motion to reopen and the extraordinary remedy of reopening his removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g., Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). While we recognize that the respondent is married to a United States citizen, the two visa petitions she has filed on his behalf have been denied. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

*1 The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed a June 6, 2012, decision, in which an Immigration Judge denied her motion to reopen. Both the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), as well as amicus curiae, have filed briefs concerning the appeal, which will be dismissed.1
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i),(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent adjusted to lawful permanent resident status on July 3, 1991. She was convicted in Kansas on May 3, 2002, of theft, and on March 20, 2003, of giving a worthless check. She was convicted on October 21, 2005, of possession of methamphetamine, a felony under Kansas law.
 
On October 21, 2005, she was charged with being subject to removal under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as having been convicted of an aggravated felony relating to trafficking in a controlled substance; under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, for having been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of misconduct, and under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, for having been convicted of a violation relating to a controlled substance.
 
The respondent on November 1, 2005, signed a “Stipulated Request For Issuance of Final Order Of Removal, Waiver of Appearance and Hearing.” Consequently, on November 8, 2005, an Immigration Judge issued a decision finding that the respondent had waived a hearing before an Immigration Judge, admitted the truthfulness of the allegations and the charges in the Notice to Appear, conceded that she was ineligible for relief from removal, and requested a removal order. The Immigration Judge thus ordered the respondent removed to Mexico.
 
The respondent was removed to Mexico on November 10, 2005, and returned to the United States on November 27, 2005. A DHS official reinstated the previous removal order under section 241(a)(5) of the Act in Kansas on September 23, 2010, and she was again removed to Mexico, where she remains.
 
On October 17, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit dismissed the respondent’s petition for review concerning the September 23, 2010, reinstatement order. Cordova-Soto v. Holder, 659 F.3d 1029 (10th Cir. 2011).2
 
*2 The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court on January 24, 2012, concerning the November 8, 2005, removal order. She argued that the 2005 removal order should be reopened and rescinded, as the stipulation she signed was not knowing and intelligent. That is, according to the respondent, she was advised that she was not eligible for relief from removal, when later, in 2006, persons in her situation became eligible to seek cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. Gonzales-Gomez v. Achim, 441 F.3d 532 (7th Cir. 2006)(drug offense that was classified as a felony under state law, but only a misdemeanor under the Controlled Substances Act, did not constitute an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act).
 
The Immigration Judge held on June 6, 2012, that there were “multiple grounds” for denying the motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge correctly found that the motion was untimely filed, I.J. at 3, as the motion was filed more than six years after the final administrative order of November 8, 2005. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1)(motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the entry of a final order of removal); DHS Br. at 4-5.3 The motion to reopen fit no exception to untimely motions under section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act. The arguments against the stipulated order of removal belatedly raised by the respondent, Respondent’s Br. at 18, and amicus, could have been presented in a timely motion to reopen.
 
Moreover, there was no basis for “equitable tolling” of the motions deadline, compare Respondent’s Br. at 18-20, where there was no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presented, or other reason to show that the respondent was unaware of the status of her case, which could possibly excuse the lateness of the motion. El-Gazawy v. Holder, ___ F.3d ___, 2012 WL 3517596 (7th Cir. 2012)(“equitable tolling requires a court to consider whether a reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have been aware of the possibility that he had suffered an injury”)(citation omitted).
 
The Immigration Judge also properly concluded that the respondent failed to establish exceptional circumstances which would warrant sua sponte reopening under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). I.J. at 3-4; Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent’s appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.4
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

A courtesy copy of this decision will be sent to attorney Jennifer Lee Koh, who filed a brief on behalf of amicus curiae.

2

The court found that it lacked jurisdiction to review the underlying 2005 removal order, as the respondent did not file a petition for review concerning that order within 30 days. Cordova-Soto v. Holder, supra, at 1031-32.

3

The respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge “made no specific holding as to timeliness” concerning the motion, Respondent’s Br. at 17, is incorrect, where the Immigration Judge indeed stated that “. . . the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than six years after entry of a final administrative order...” I.J. at 3.

4

The respondent requests that this appeal be assigned for review by a three-member panel of the Board. Respondent’s Br. at 2. The request is denied. The case does not present one of the circumstances listed in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(6) that warrant review by a three-member panel.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Terry Smart, Jr., Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 9, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that he has demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear, due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we find it appropriate to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge conducted a full evidentiary hearing on March 27, 2000. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Immigration Judge provided the respondent with 30 days to submit additional documentation in support of his applications for relief from removal and stated that he would set a new court date to go over the additional evidence (Tr. at 101). On April 28, 2000, the Immigration Judge held a hearing; however, neither the respondent nor his counsel were present (Tr. at 103). The respondent also did not submit any additional evidence within the 30 day period allowed by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 103).
 
It is unclear from the record whether the respondent or his counsel of record was informed of the date and time of the April 28, 2000, hearing. The record contains a notice of hearing dated March 27, 2000, providing that the respondent was scheduled for a hearing on April 28, 2000, at 9 a.m. However, the certificate of service is blank and the transcript of the respondent’s March 27, 2000, hearing does not indicate that the Immigration Judge necessarily intended to hold a subsequent hearing, if the respondent did not submit additional evidence within the 30 day period. Even if the Immigration Judge intended to hold a hearing on April 28, 2000, he did not orally advise the respondent or his counsel of the time of the hearing. Under these circumstances, we will reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with an opportunity to appear for a hearing. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

Mirta J. Woodall
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 An Immigration Judge has certified the case to the Board under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). The record will again be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Poland, was ordered removed in absentia on February 18, 2004. An Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen on August 24, 2011. The Immigration Judge concluded that the removal hearing notice was sent to the respondent’s attorney of record, Robert E. Coughlon, Jr., and the respondent did not present a sufficient claim concerning any ineffective assistance of counsel provided by Coughlon.
 
The respondent filed a timely appeal with the Board concerning the Immigration Judge’s August 24, 2011, decision. The Board issued a decision on December 9, 2011. We set out the respondent’s claim on appeal that he did not receive proper notice of his removal hearing, inasmuch as it was mailed to Coughlon, whom the respondent maintained he did not retain to represent him in removal proceedings. We went on to remand the case to the Immigration Court, as the record was incomplete. That is, we stated in the December 9, 2011, decision:
According to the Immigration Judge’s decision, the record contains a Notice of Entry of Appearance before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) on behalf of the respondent by attorney Robert Coughlon, Jr. (I.J. at 2). However, a review of the record prepared for this Board does not contain this document. Given the respondent’s arguments regarding his representation before the Immigration Court by Robert Coughlon, Jr., we find it necessary to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to ensure that the Board has a complete record of the respondent’s proceedings before the Immigration Court.
 
 
According to the record, an Immigration Judge scheduled a master calendar hearing concerning the respondent for June 6, 2012. It appears that a very short hearing was held that day, which related to the respondent and other individuals.
 
The Immigration Judge certified the record back to the Board on June 8, 2012. He attached a summary order dated June 6, 2012. The summary order says that the case was remanded by the Board to “reconsider motion to reopen”, which was not the directive in the Board’s December 9, 2011, decision. The Immigration Judge does not address the actual substance of the Board’s December 9, 2011, remand order, which in fact concerned an incomplete record. We therefore will again remand the record to the Immigration Court, so that the Immigration Judge may consider, and address, the fact that the record is incomplete.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion and our decision of December 9, 2011.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
N. Jude Menes, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia D. Goodman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 22, 2010 decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent filed his motion with the Immigration Judge on December 2, 2010 while claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the time of the Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2010 pre-conclusion voluntary departure grant under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We hold that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. In particular, while the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge improperly focused on the untimely nature of his motion in light of his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance (i.e., which may toll the filing deadline for his motion), we find that his claim for reopening should be denied as he failed to show any prejudice given that he is not currently eligible for any form of relief (Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Br. at 1). See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988) (an applicant seeking reopening must establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought).
 
The respondent maintains that his former counsel failed to appear in court for his master calendar hearing--which allegedly led to the respondent accepting voluntary departure despite lacking full understanding of its implications--and that such counsel falsely promised various forms of immigration relief, actions which ultimately deprived the respondent of “an opportunity to present the bona fides of his valid and legitimate marriage to a U.S. citizen” (Respondent’s Br. at 4-6, 10-11). Even accepting the respondent’s contention that he substantively complied with the procedural requirements described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not established prejudice from the actions of his prior counsel as he has not provided any evidence showing that the outcome of his case might have been different if such counsel acted with sufficient competence. See U.S. v. Herrera, 412 F.3d 577, 580 (5th Cir. 2005) (noting that in order to prove prejudice, an applicant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different) (internal citations omitted). In particular, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that had his counsel been effective, the respondent would have presented evidence demonstrating that his marriage was legitimate as he has not addressed, much less reconciled, the fact that the DHS previously issued an intent to deny his wife’s petition for alien relative (Form I-130) that was filed on his behalf upon concluding that their marriage was not bona fide and that it was entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws (Exh. 2; Respondent’s Br. at 8, 11). See, e.g., Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009); Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). While the respondent further states that he and his wife remain married and that another I-130 petition that was filed on his behalf is pending with the DHS, we are not inclined to remand the matter for additional proceedings to await adjudication of such a petition based on the particular facts of this case (Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). See generally Morgan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a continuance for adjudication of a second visa petition when the first I-130 filed by the same petitioner was denied by the USCIS for failure to establish a bona fide marriage).
 
*2 To the extent the respondent contends that his former counsel misrepresented his eligibility for asylum, the respondent has not presented any intelligible argument suggesting that he may be able to demonstrate eligibility for asylum or any other form of relief (Respondent’s Br. at 8). See, e.g., Matter of Almanza, 24 I&N Dec. 771 (BIA 2009) (the burden is on the respondent to establish eligibility for relief). As we see no evidence before us indicating that a remand of the proceedings might lead to a different result in this matter, the respondent’s charges of ineffective assistance of counsel do not undermine the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability or underlying decision.
 
Further, while the respondent has filed supplemental evidence on appeal, we may not accept these documents into the record as we are precluded from engaging in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003-1(d)(3)(iv). Even considering such information, the respondent has not identified any specific evidence which, if presented, would have affected the proceeding below, nor has he illustrated how the Immigration Judge’s decision remains incomplete or defective. As such, the respondent has not established that a remand is warranted for any reason. See Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031 (BIA 1999). We also find that the circumstances presented by the respondent are not “exceptional” as to justify a sua sponte reopening of the matter (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). To the extent that the respondent seeks a stay of removal, he has not shown why the execution of his removal order should be stayed and we accordingly deny his request in this regard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f). Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of China, was ordered removed in absentia on March 8, 2004. On January 15, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on June 26, 2009. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that his motion was untimely and did not warrant sua sponte reopening. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
Upon review, we find that in light of the circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance with respect to the respondent’s application for adjustment of status which resulted in the issuance of the Notice to Appear and the respondent being placed into proceedings as well as his direction to the respondent not to appear at his March 8, 2004, hearing, we will allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing. We note that the respondent acted diligently upon discovering his former counsel’s deficient performance. In reaching this conclusion, we further note that he respondent is the beneficiary of an approved I-130.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Morris M. Wu, Esquire
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of China. He has appealed from the decision of an Immigration Judge, mailed on June 11, 2012, denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings, conducted in absentia on February 14, 2000. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not filed a brief concerning the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i),(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent argued in his motion to reopen that an “exceptional circumstance” prevented his appearance at his removal hearing. That is, he claimed that counsel gave him an incorrect removal hearing date of February 15, 2000, and he learned on that date that he had been ordered removed in absentia the day before.
 
Even assuming that the respondent’s attorney provided an incorrect hearing date, and that such advice could be considered an “exceptional circumstance” for failing to appear, the respondent did not file his motion to reopen within the 180 day period provided for seeking reopening of an in absentia order based on “exceptional circumstances.” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. §1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); I.J. at 2.1
 
Nor did the respondent demonstrate that he acted with due diligence in seeking reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. I.J. at 2. According to the respondent’s affidavit, he was aware since February 15, 2000, that he had been ordered removed in absentia, but filed the motion to reopen over 12 years later.
 
We find, as did the Immigration Judge, that the respondent did not pursue reopening of these proceedings with due diligence. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131-32 (2d Cir. 2008); Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267, 268 (2d Cir. 2006); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); I.J. at 2. Under these circumstances, the 180-day deadline for seek reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not tolled. The motion to reopen was untimely filed. The Immigration Judge’s decision will, therefore, be affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent argues on appeal that he did not receive notice of the removal hearing. Rather, the respondent received proper notice of the hearing from the Immigration Court, as written notice of the hearing was provided to his counsel of record on September 23, 1999. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to a respondent. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). To the extent that the respondent blamed counsel for his failure to appear at the removal hearing, his claim was that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; I.J. at 2; Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996).

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a male native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision mailed on March 19, 2012, that denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) on July 7, 2003, listing the time and place of his hearing and the consequences of any failure to appear (Exh. 1). We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received proper notice pursuant to our decision in Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 185 (BIA 2001) (stating that the entry of an in absentia order is authorized when the alien has been given written notice of the removal hearing). Further, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal that he did not receive proper notice because he was a minor. The Form I-213 reflects that the respondent was 19 years old when the NTA was personally served (Exh. 2). Accordingly, additional notice provisions do not apply in this case. See Lopez-Dubon v. Holder, 609 F.3d 642 (5th Cir. 2010) (concluding that notice must be served on an adult only for aliens under 14 years of age); Matter of Cubor, 25 I&N Dec. 470 (BIA 2011) (holding that personal service of a charging document on a minor who is 14 years of age or older is effective service).
 
The respondent also argues that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances. In particular, the respondent claims that he hired a purported attorney to file a change of venue motion on his behalf and that this individual advised the respondent not to appear for his hearing in Harlingen, Texas. However, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is untimely as it was not filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Vaz Dos Reis v. Holder, 606 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that with respect to motions to reopen in absentia proceedings courts typically treat ineffective assistance of counsel claims as an exceptional circumstance). To the extent that the respondent requests equitable tolling of the riling deadline, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not held in a published decision that filing deadlines before this Board may be equitably tolled. Rather, in Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008), the court found that a request for equitable tolling was in effect a request that the Board exercise sua sponte authority over an untimely motion under at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and that the court lacks jurisdiction to review a decision by the Board not to exercise this authority.
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. The respondent was personally served with a NTA listing the time and place of his hearing. Moreover, the record reflects that he was provided oral notice in the Spanish language of his hearing date and the consequences of failing to appear (Exh. 1). He has also not established what efforts he took to determine the status of his removal proceeding after receiving the NTA more than 8 years before he filed his motion to reopen. Cf. Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 954 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding with respect to cases that commenced before 1992 that a motion to reopen could not be denied based on lack of due diligence). We decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David N. Shomloo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On July 19, 2012, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen in proceedings in which the Board dismissed his appeal on December 22, 2011. The Board granted his request for a stay of removal on July 24, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); see also Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278, 1283-84 (9th Cir. 2005). However, the respondent asks that the Board reissue our prior decision as he contends that he was afforded ineffective assistance by former counsel, Ms. Stevens (Motion at 4). Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). Specifically, he contends Ms. Stevens did not inform him of the Board’s adverse decision, which prevented him from filing a timely petition for review with the circuit court (Motion at 6, 10). He also asks that the Board grant his motion sua sponte (Motion at 7, 16).
 
Although in rare cases we have reissued decisions in order to remedy a lack of notice arising from the ineffective assistance of an alien’s counsel of record, this is reserved for very exceptional circumstances not present here. The respondent has submitted evidence reflecting that he informed Ms. Stevens of the allegations against her, and that he filed a bar complaint in this regard. However, he has not demonstrated that he experienced prejudice as a result of Ms. Stevens’ actions, as is required for reopening pursuant to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iturribarria v. INS, supra.
 
In his declaration in support of his motion the respondent asks that the Board reissue its decision, stating that he is “eligible for cancellation of removal” (Decl. at 3). However, as the DHS notes, the respondent is ineligible for such relief as his period of continuous physical presence was terminated on June 26, 2008, when he was voluntarily returned to his native Mexico (Exh. 2). The respondent also has not submitted an application for cancellation with his motion, as required. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). As the respondent has not demonstrated any plausible ground for relief, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by Ms. Stevens’ actions. Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Moreover, we do not find that this case presents exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fuhao Yang, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a 30-year-old male native and citizen of China, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s written decision dated April 28, 2011, which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the credibility determination, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993).
 
The respondent was issued a Notice to Appear on October 29, 2002 (Exh. 1). Through his prior attorney, Liu Yu, he requested a change of venue from San Antonio, Texas, to New York City, which was granted on December 27, 2002. He appeared on January 23, 2003, in New York City with counsel, and he was issued a hearing notice for July 3, 2003 (Exh. 3). He retained Charles Day as his attorney on January 23, 2003.
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on July 3, 2003, at which the respondent failed to appear, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged, determined that he had abandoned all potential applications for relief, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.
 
In his motion to reopen filed on February 25, 2011, the respondent alleged that when he arrived for his hearing on July 3, 2003, Mr. Day told him that he was not required to appear that day, that he had requested a continuance and that he would notify him of his next hearing date. He indicated that Mr. Day did not speak Chinese, that he usually communicated with Mr. Day’s assistant who spoke Chinese, and that the assistant was present on July 3, 2003, when he arrived for the hearing. At the beginning of 2005, the respondent indicated that he discovered that Mr. Day’s law office had been closed, he attempted to retain other attorneys who declined to represent him, and he did not discover that he had been ordered removed in absentia until he obtained his alien registration number from his prior attorney, Mr. Yu, in 2006.1 In 2010, he claimed to have learned for the first time that Mr. Day had been disbarred in 2006, he alleges that he filed a bar complaint against him in 2011, and he attached a copy of a certified mail receipt addressed to the New York State Bar disciplinary committee dated February 14, 2011, to his motion. However, he failed to include a copy of the complaint itself. The respondent requested equitable tolling based on the alleged ineffective assistance of Mr. Day.2
 
*2 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a response in opposition to the motion, alleging that the respondent had not established due diligence to qualify for equitable tolling in light of his claim that he discovered the existence of his in absentia removal order in 2006, yet failed to file a motion to reopen until 5 years later without an adequate explanation for the delay.
 
On April 28, 2001, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely. She concluded that the respondent had failed to establish that he exercised due diligence to qualify for equitable tolling of the filing deadline in view of his waiting 5 years, until 2011, to file a motion after discovering in 2006 that he had been ordered removed in absentia. She also noted that the respondent did not attach an asylum application to the motion, and that no application ever was filed before the entry of the in absentia removal order.
 
On appeal, the respondent continues to allege that he has qualified for equitable tolling. He also claims that the Immigration Judge was biased against him and failed to address his claim that he attempted to exercise due diligence, but that the attorneys he contacted allegedly declined to represent him after they learned that his case had been assigned to her.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent received personal service of his hearing for July 3, 2003. Although he learned that he had been ordered removed in absentia in 2006, he failed to file a motion to reopen until 5 years later, in 2011. To the extent that the respondent claims that he was unable to retain another attorney until 2011, he does not explain why he did not contact the Immigration Court directly to resolve his immigration status, or why he did not rehire his prior immigration attorney, Mr. Yu, when he contacted him in 2006 to obtain his alien registration number.
 
Therefore, even if the respondent established ineffective assistance on the part of Mr. Day, he has not demonstrated due diligence to obtain equitable tolling of the deadline to file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) (to equitably toll filing deadline for motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence during entire period he seeks to toll, including both before and after ineffective assistance was or should have been discovered, and period from that point until motion is filed); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (aliens who waited 2 years to file motion based on ineffective assistance did not establish due diligence to obtain equitable tolling); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000) (alien who waited 2 years to file motion based on ineffective assistance did not establish due diligence).
 
*3 Although the respondent indicates on appeal that he is requesting reopening in order to apply for asylum, he has not established his prima facie eligibility because he has failed to attach a completed asylum application. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In his affidavit attached to his motion, the respondent claimed that other attorneys declined to represent him because of the identity of the Immigration Judge assigned to his case. These claims are wholly unsubstantiated.

The Board expelled Mr. Day from practice before the Board, the Immigration Courts and the Department of Homeland Security on January 18, 2007, based on his disbarment in New York on May 4, 2006.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On August 21, 2009, the respondent failed to appear for his removal hearing and was ordered removed in absentia by the Immigration Judge. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied in a November 3, 2010, decision. The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial, but the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in a June 28, 2011, decision. On July 26, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board based on the alleged ineffectiveness of his former counsel. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on June 28, 2011. Generally, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i)ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A request for rescission of an in absentia order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date that the order of removal is issued. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) and 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The present motion was filed on July 26, 2012, well beyond the filing deadlines. In addition, the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen that was denied by the Immigration Judge on November 3, 2010.
 
However, aliens raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Aliens relying on equitable tolling have the burden of demonstrating that they exercised due diligence in discovering the fraud or error.
 
We find that the respondent’s untimely and number-barred motion to reopen does not qualify for equitable tolling. The respondent has not demonstrated that he exercised the requisite diligence in filing the instant motion. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on August 21, 2009, and on June 28, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen. However, the respondent waited until July 26, 2012, to file the instant motion, and has not specified what he did between June 28 2011, and July 26, 2012, to protect his rights or when he definitely learned of his prior counsel’s incompetence. Given the lack of evidence regarding the steps he took to preserve his rights from June 2011 to July 2012, we find that the respondent did not act with due diligence. See Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir. 2007) (refusing to toll where immigrant failed to investigate suspicions of incompetence for 6 months). In any event, the respondent has not submitted the requisite application for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
*2 We alternatively find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).1 See generally, Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008). The respondent has not included a personal affidavit or any correspondence to his prior counsel regarding his allegations of ineffectiveness. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that alien did not comply with Lozada where he did not submit an affidavit and did not provide former counsel with an adequate opportunity to respond to allegation). The respondent also has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority nor adequately explained why he has not done so.
 
Finally, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay is denied.

Under Matter of Lozada, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must satisfy the following procedural requirements: (1) an affidavit of the alien attesting to the relevant facts, including a detailed description of the agreement with former counsel, (2) former counsel must be informed of the allegations and provided with an opportunity to respond, and (3) indicate whether a complaint has been filed the appropriate disciplinary authority, and if not, why not.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richa Puri, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 4, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).2 The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it. The respondent has offered evidence of that with the appeal. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).3 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. In his brief on appeal, the respondent acknowledges that his motion regarding one of his convictions has been denied by the State Court, but urges that the other is still pending and would affect his eligibility for relief.

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick Anthony Powell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anthony M. Cacavio
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 17, 2012, ordering his removal from the United States.1 We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision in this matter. In this case, the respondent, through counsel, has conceded that he is subject to removal from the United States as a result of his 2010 Georgia state conviction for Possession of Marijuana with Intent to Distribute (I.J. at 1 -2; Tr. at 200; Exh. 1). See section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). While we recognize that the respondent believes that his criminal defense attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, it is well settled that the Immigration Judges and this Board cannot entertain collateral attacks upon State court judgments. See Mohammed v. Ashcroft, 261 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir. 2001); Zinnanti v. INS, 651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir. July 24, 1981);2 Matter of Cuellar, 25 I&N Dec. 850, 854-855 (BIA 2012). If the respondent believes his conviction is unconstitutional, then his remedy is to seek post-conviction relief in the Georgia courts. However, the conviction remains effective for immigration purposes unless and until it is vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
On appeal, the respondent does not allege that, in light of his conviction he is eligible for any form of relief from removal. Moreover, he does not meaningfully allege on appeal that his desire to pursue post-conviction relief warranted a further continuance of these removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.29, 1240.6; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1997); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Even if such claim was properly before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that, in light of the speculative nature of post-conviction claims, the respondent’s desire to pursue such claims did not warrant a further continuance (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 219-220).
 
As the respondent is subject to removal from the United States as a result of his criminal history and has not established eligibility for relief from removal, the Immigration Judge properly concluded these proceedings by entering an order of removal. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We recognize that the respondent refers to his current detention in his appeal brief. However, removal proceedings are separate and apart from bond proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d). Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider issues regarding the respondent’s detention in the instant removal proceedings.

In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions handed down prior to October 1, 1981.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerald Karikari, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of the People’s Republic of China, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 1, 1999, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on January 25, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied it on March 22, 2011, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent does not argue with particularity on appeal that he did not receive adequate notice of the hearing or that ineffective assistance of counsel warrants reopening based on “exceptional circumstances.” We therefore affirm those aspects of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying reopening to allow him an opportunity to seek adjudication of his application for adjustment of status. The respondent is an arriving alien in removal proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion to the extent that it seeks adjustment of status consideration was filed more than 90 days after he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. His request for reopening to that extent is therefore untimely. See Matter of Monges, 25 I&N Dec. 246 (BIA 2010); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998); I.J. at 6. We will additionally not reopen these proceedings sua sponte solely for the purpose of delaying the enforcement of the respondent’s removal order while his adjustment of status application remains pending with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009). The Immigration Judge’s decision is also affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. There is no issue regarding whether the respondent knew that he had a scheduled removal hearing. Thus, the respondent had notice of his hearing and can seek reopening of proceedings solely upon the basis of exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In this case, those circumstances allegedly arise due to the respondent’s claim that on the day of his hearing he was hospitalized due to a serious injury. However, motions to reopen to rescind an in absentia order based upon exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the date of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order. Id. The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed over 6 years after he was ordered removed. His motion to reopen, therefore, was untimely filed, as properly found by the Immigration Judge.
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that even if equitable tolling is taken into consideration, the respondent has not established how his former attorney, Terrence McGuire, prevented him from filing a motion to reopen for over 6 years. In particular, the respondent claims that in November 2005 he hired Mr. McGuire to file a motion to reopen on his behalf. The respondent, however, does not recount when he learned that Mr. McGuire failed to file a motion to reopen in the respondent’s case. To the extent that the respondent indicates for the first time on appeal that he became suspicious of Mr. McGuire in early 2011 after discovering that his phone was disconnected, the respondent has not described in detail why he waited until March 2012 to file a motion to reopen if he first became suspicious in early 2011 of Mr. McGuire. In addition, the respondent has not reported what efforts he took to determine the status of his removal proceedings following his consultation with Mr. McGuire. Consequently, the respondent has not established the requisite due diligence in filing his motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011) (setting forth the requirements for due diligence).
 
*2 Attached to the Notice of Appeal the respondent submitted documentation apparently relating to his exceptional circumstances claim that he suffered a serious injury prior to his November 21, 2005, hearing. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, the respondent has not shown that this evidence is new and previously unavailable, or that it could possibly alter the decision in this case. Therefore, we find that a remand is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shan D. Potts, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On March 22, 2012, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to terminate these removal proceedings. On May 9, 2012, the respondent filed the instant timely motion to reopen to enable him to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved immediate relative visa petition, dated October 30, 2006, classifying him as the parent of a United States citizen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a statement opposing this motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent, who was previously represented by the above-named attorney before the Immigration Judge and the Board, now claims that he did not pursue an application for adjustment of status previously in these proceedings due to ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that ineffective assistance of counsel in handling the respondent’s potential eligibility for adjustment is sufficiently clear on the face of the record that reopening is warranted even without full compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Rodriguez-Lariz v. I.N.S., 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the respondent’s timely, unopposed motion to reopen will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia A. McKenzie, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mary C. Lee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 1, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
At the hearing, the respondent asked for a continuance to allow him to collaterally attack his conviction (Exh. 3). The Immigration Judge denied the request (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 14-15). The respondent requested no other relief (Tr. at 16).
 
On appeal, the respondent says that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).2 The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a writ of habeas corpus to vacate it. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).3 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue post-conviction relief, a writ of habeas corpus does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The writ does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel.

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on July 28, 2011, and on June 27, 2012, the respondent filed the instant motion with the Board. Whether construed as a motion to reopen or as a motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion is untimely. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991) (discussing motions to reopen and motions to reconsider); sections 240(c)(6)(B), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(B), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant motion. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board). He specifically claims that his former attorney did not properly contest on appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for relief; did not file a timely motion to reopen the proceedings; and did not file a timely petition for judicial review of the Board’s prior order.
 
The filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jin Bo Zhao v. I.N.S., 452 F.3d 154, 160 (2nd Cir. 2006). In order to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, the respondent must substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2nd Cir. 2005). (“[A]n alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements in her motion to reopen before the BIA forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim”).
 
Before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. In the present case, the respondent has failed to comply with Lozada’s notice requirement. There is no evidence now before the Board to show that the respondent has made any attempt to inform his former attorney of the allegations against her, or that his former attorney has otherwise been made aware of the allegations. Further, the respondent has not explained why he has not properly notified his former attorney of the allegations against her. Id.
 
*2 In certain circumstances, “slavish adherence” to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, is unnecessary. See Ruiz-Martinez v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 102, 121 (2d Cir.2008). In the respondent’s case, however, ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent on the face of the record. See YiLong Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 143 (2nd Cir.2007). Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra.
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has not set forth a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim, equitable tolling of the filing deadlines is not warranted in this case. Further, no exception to the filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen appears to apply to this motion, and no exceptional situation has been shown to be present in this case to warrant the exercise of the Board’s limited authority to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3). Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen and reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and reconsider is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas M. Lehrman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott D. Gambill
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Nigeria. On November 8, 2010, an Immigration Judge pretermitted his application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. This appeal followed.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). These proceedings fall within the REAL ID Act.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in pretermitting his application for adjustment of status. He acknowledges that the visa petition filed on his behalf by his spouse was denied by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). According to the respondent, the denial is being appealed to the Board, and the Immigration Judge erred by not continuing the proceedings until a decision was rendered on the appeal. However, our records indicate that the appeal of the visa petition denial was dismissed by the Board on February 23, 2011. The respondent is therefore ineligible for a grant of adjustment of status because he is not the beneficiary of an approved visa petition. The issue of whether the Immigration Judge correctly denied the continuance request is thus now moot. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
We note that the respondent raises other issues on appeal relating to the reason his current counsel did not timely respond to the motion to pretermitt. We need not address whether the respondent may have been a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel inasmuch as the above determination is dispositive.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent filed a motion to reopen after the Immigration Judge pretermitted his adjustment of status application. However, the motion was not adjudicated because the respondent appealed the order pretermitting his application before the Immigration Judge had the opportunity to decide the motion.

APPLICATION: Administrative closure, continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Germany, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States since October 29, 1956, has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 19, 2012, denying his request that his proceedings be continued or administratively closed while he pursued post-conviction relief. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion for a continuance or administrative closure so that he may pursue post-conviction relief. The Immigration Judge properly denied the request for failure to demonstrate good cause because the outcome of any efforts to obtain post-conviction relief, including a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), would be speculative, and the respondent’s conviction is considered final for immigration purposes unless and until it is overturned.1 See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240; Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n.8 (BIA 2009) (“A pending collateral attack does not disturb the finality of a conviction and therefore would not justify reopening of removal proceedings.”); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992) (“the possibility of a decision on any post-conviction motion that has been filed does not affect our finding that the respondent is deportable.”). See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012) (“[I]t would not be appropriate to administratively close proceedings if the request is based on a purely speculative event or action... or an event or action that may or may not affect the course of an alien’s immigration proceedings (such as a collateral attack on a criminal conviction.”)
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We point out that the respondent admitted the allegation stating that, subsequent to the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla, his convictions were upheld by the Court of Appeals for the State of Oregon. Further, more than 4 months have elapsed since the Immigration Judge rendered his decision in this case, and the respondent has not provided information that he has prevailed in his collateral criminal proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 29, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. We find that the respondent’s contention that his in absentia order of removal should be vacated because he had departed the United States prior to his removal hearing is without merit. In Matter of Brown, 18 I&N Dec. 324, 325 (BIA 1982), the Board held that an alien “cannot compel the termination of deportation proceedings which have been commenced against him merely by effecting a departure and reentry.” Once jurisdiction was vested with the Immigration Judge by the filing of the Notice to Appear (Form I-862), the Immigration Judge obtained jurisdiction and the respondent remained subject to removal proceedings, even though he departed the United States and re-entered. Hence, when the respondent did not appear for his scheduled removal hearing, we find that the Immigration Judge properly entered an order of removal.1
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that his failure to appear for his hearing was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (requiring that motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the date of the order of removal). Moreover, the respondent has not fully complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).2
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent has not established that his motion should be granted pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

To the extent that the respondent references an unpublished Board decision finding to the contrary, we note that this Board is not bound by its unpublished decisions.

We would apply similar reasoning affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen if the respondent had simply been ordered removed instead of being ordered removed in absentia. The respondent’s motion to reopen was not filed within 90 days of his order of removal and the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is subject to any exception to the filing deadline. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed in absentia on June 9, 2011. On June 13, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on August 15, 2011. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that he had received proper notice for his June 9, 2011, hearing. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
Upon review, we find that in view of the above and in light of the totality of circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s counsel conceded that he provided ineffective assistance by failing to appear at the June 9, 2011, hearing, we will allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case has been the subject of two prior Board decisions. In the Board’s decision on September 21, 2011, the appeal was dismissed, and a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied. In denying the motion to remand, the Board found that there had been no compliance with the threshold procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, noting that more than one year had elapsed since the appeal was filed. On March 9, 2012, the Board denied a motion for reconsideration of the September 21, 2011, decision and a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance before the Immigration Judge, finding that the respondent and current counsel could have pursued an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with Lozada compliance before the Immigration Judge or on appeal. See Tr. at 12-13. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s decisions on March 9, 2012, and September 21, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2), only one motion to reconsider a Board decision is permitted, and a party may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. Consequently, the respondent’s second motion for reconsideration of the September 21, 2011, decision, and motion for reconsideration of the March 9, 2012, denial of reconsideration will be denied. The respondent also has not shown that reconsideration of the March 2012 denial of reopening is warranted, as there is no legal or factual defect in the decision denying reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent’s tactical decision to delay pursuit of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and/or compliance with the procedural threshold requirements for such a claim is not tantamount to showing that evidence in support of such a claim could not have been obtained and presented at the hearing below. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stacy Tolchin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nathan L. Herbert
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. This case was last before the Board on October 7, 2008, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The final administrative order was entered in these proceedings on November 9, 2004, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The current motion to reopen was filed on March 28, 2012, and two prior motions to reopen where denied by the Board in 2007 and 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent is seeking reopening and termination of his removal proceedings or cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), but such a motion does not fall within any exception to the time and numerical limits for a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3) (setting forth exceptions to the time and number limits). To the extent that the respondent is raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney, he has not established prejudice such that equitable tolling of the time and number limits is warranted. See Akinwunmi v. INS, 194 F.3d 1340, 1341 n.2 (10th Cir. 1999). While the respondent urges that his prior counsel should have argued that he was not removable pursuant to the Board’s decision in Matter of Paulus, 11 I&N Dec. 274 (BIA 1965), the respondent has not established that the specific controlled substance of “steroids” was not listed on the Federal controlled substances schedule for both 1996 and 2000. The respondent’s reliance on the current controlled substances schedules to assert that the California and Federal controlled substances schedules do not coincide, is misplaced. As such, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s actions or inactions such that equitable tolling of the time and number limits is warranted.
 
The respondent further urges that he warrants sua sponte reopening because he is no longer removable as an aggravated felon pursuant to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Carachurri-Rosendo v. Holder, 130 S.Ct. 2577 (2010). He further asserts that in light of this recent case law, his removal proceedings should be reopened and terminated or in the alternative that he is statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), despite his involuntary removal from the United States on March 2, 2005.1 However, the respondent does not contest that he was removable as an aggravated felon at the time of his removal from the United States in 2005 (Motion at 13). As such, the respondent’s removal from the United States in March 2005 was lawful and this removal served to terminate the respondent’s lawful permanent residence status. See Matter of Lok, 18 I&N Dec. 101, 106 (BIA 1981); Matter of Mosqueda, 14 I&N Dec. 55, 56-57 (R.C. 1972). Consequently, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act because he is no longer lawfully admitted for permanent residence. See section 240A(a)(1) of the Act. For the same reason, termination of the respondent’s removal proceedings is not appropriate. A decision of this Board granting the respondent’s motion would not restore him to his prior lawful permanent resident status, moreover, because such an order is merely an interlocutory measure authorizing the submission of new evidence; it does not abrogate the existing removal order or confer lawful immigration status on the movant. Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 354 (BIA 1998). Since the respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for any immediately available forms of relief, we do not find reopening is warranted. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent’s departure pursuant to his March 2, 2005, removal precludes merit consideration of his untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). As the respondent concedes the untimeliness of his third motion and its inability to fall within any exception to the time and number limitations, he has not demonstrated that the departure bar would not apply to his motion. See Contreras-Bocanegra v. Holder, 629 F.3d 1170 (10th Cir. 2010), rev’d en banc, 678 F.3d 811 (10th Cir. 2012).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The final administrative order of removal in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 31, 2006. On April 27, 2012, alleging ineffective of former counsels, the respondent, a native and citizen of Belize, filed the pending motion to reopen. However, the motion is untimely filed and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable filing deadlines. The respondent does not specifically contend that she was unaware of the Board’s August 31, 2006, decision. Nor does she specially assert or indicate in any way that the alleged action or inaction of former counsels prevented her from timely filing the instant motion. Indeed, she does not dispute that she was aware of the alleged deficient performances of former counsels prior to the Board’s August 31, 2006, decision. Under the circumstances, particularly where, as here, first former counsel describes the respondent’s lack of cooperation in pursuing her claim, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that she received ineffective assistance. Nor has she sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against each of her former counsels, including the requirement that she show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). Nor has there been any showing of due diligence in pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra.
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided us with an adequate reason to excuse the untimeliness of her motion. Nor has she demonstrated any exceptional circumstance that would warrant the reopening of these proceedings under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.1

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 19, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen, arguing that his proceedings should be reopened and remanded based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by his prior attorney. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. We find that reopening and remand of the respondent’s proceedings are warranted based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the motion is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings and for the entry of a new decision. On remand, the respondent shall bear the burden of establishing that he is eligible for any form of relief he seeks and that he should be granted such relief as a matter of discretion.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bibiana C. Andrade, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela Marra
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 31, 2011, the Board entered the final administrative order in this case, and on February 29, 2012, the Board denied the respondent’s previous motion to reopen. On March 29, 2012, the respondent filed the instant untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent now raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). He alleges prejudicial error on the part of his former attorney because she entered pleading on his behalf, thereby admitting to his being removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (present without being admitted or paroled), thus precluding his eligibility for adjustment of status. He specifically argues that his former attorney should have denied the allegation that the respondent is an alien present in the United States without being admitted and paroled because he was paroled into the United States pursuant to a grant of advanced parole under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent first entered the United States without inspection on or about March 15, 1999, as alleged in the Notice to Appear, and that he was subsequently authorized to be paroled upon his return to the United States to pursue a pending application for adjustment of status. The fact that the respondent was paroled into the United States pursuant to a grant of advanced parole does not, under the circumstances, render the respondent admissible. See Ibragimov v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d 125 (2nd Cir. 2007); Matter of G-A-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 83, 88-89 (BIA 1998) (explaining that section 212(d)(5) of the Act makes clear that the parole shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2)(i). In the present case, the respondent was properly placed in removal proceedings and charged with inadmissibility following the denial by the DHS of his application for adjustment of status on August 8, 2003, and the revocation of his parole.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rabiu v. I.N.S., 41 F.3d 879, 882-83 (2nd Cir. 1994); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. Therefore, equitable tolling of the filing restrictions imposed on this motion is not warranted. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). Further, it does not appear that any exception to the filing restrictions applies to this motion or that any exceptional situation is present in this case to warrant the exercise of the Board’s sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3). Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Ines Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia M. Medeiros
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on July 20, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his request for a remand based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. This motion, filed on February 8, 2012, is not timely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We construe this as an argument that the time limits on motions should be equitably tolled. The time limits on motions may be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance where an alien establishes that he was prejudiced by the misconduct, and where he has shown due diligence in discovering and correcting the errors. See Alzaarir v. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011).
 
We are not persuaded that equitable tolling is warranted in this case.
 
First, the purported ineffective assistance all occurred at the trial level, and as the respondent knew of the ostensible failures of his prior counsel at that time the untimeliness of this motion is not related to the ineffective assistance. Accordingly, equitable tolling does not apply.
 
Second, the respondent has not shown due diligence in this case. He previously raised these arguments of ineffective assistance during the course of his appeal 6 years ago and requested a remand. We denied the respondent’s request for a remand because he failed to submit the necessary corroborative evidence. The respondent has not provided any explanation for why he waited over 5 years to submit another motion.
 
The respondent’s motion does not substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He has not provided evidence of his agreement with his former attorney, he has not indicated whether he has submitted a bar complaint, and there is no evidence that the former attorney has been notified of these allegations. The respondent’s arguments relating to ineffective assistance rest primarily on his former attorney’s suspension, seemingly in an unrelated matter, which does not establish that there was ineffective assistance in this case.
 
Finally, the respondent has not included the documents which his prior attorney should ostensibly have obtained and submitted. Without being able to examine the proffered evidence, we are unable to conclude that the respondent was prejudiced in any respect.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Genet Getachew, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision issued June 27, 2011, denying her request to reopen proceedings after she was ordered removed in absentia.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief or other response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews de novo all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges, including legal and discretionary determinations and applications of law to fact. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at the February 8, 2011, hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The respondent on appeal has not challenged the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See generally Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (finding that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to “exceptional circumstances” in the context of a motion to reopen an in absentia removal order).2 The respondent has not identified the individual whom she claims purported to be able to assist her, or whether or not the individual was an attorney or otherwise authorized to represent her under section 8 C.F.R. § 1292.1. The record does not contain a Form EOIR-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative before the Immigration Court, or other evidence of representation or agreement with the respondent. To the extent the respondent’s attorney on appeal makes general assertions about the individual and the respondent’s experiences, statements of counsel are not evidence. See, e.g., INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
In the event that the individual was a non-attorney, the extent to which the Matter of Lozada requirements are mandated is an unsettled question, but some compliance has been required, generally of the first two steps. See Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94-95 (BIA 2007) (finding that the respondent satisfied the concerns underlying Matter of Lozada where she submitted to the Board a copy of a formal complaint provided to her accredited representative, whose representation and specific action had been described to the Board, and apparently offered the accredited representative an opportunity to respond). In contrast, the respondent in the instant matter has not identified the individual or the capacity in which he or she presented his or her ability to assist the respondent, the nature of the agreement between the individual and the respondent, any proof of payment, what specific representations the individual made to the respondent about her immigration proceedings, or what the individual said, if anything, specifically about the February 8, 2011, hearing at which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has also not provided evidence that a formal complaint was provided to the individual with an opportunity to respond.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by the individual’s actions. See Omar v. Mukasey, supra, at 51 (finding no error where the Board determined that the respondent had presented neither sufficient compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, to whatever extent it may be required for non-attorneys, nor prejudice from the alleged actions); see also Matter of Assaad, supra, at 561-62. The respondent has not demonstrated that she would have attended the February 8, 2011, hearing but for the advice of the individual. We note that the respondent, to whom the Notice to Appear with the time, date, and location of the Immigration Court hearing was mailed, has not argued that she did not have notice of the hearing (Exh. 1). The respondent’s statement provided with the motion to reopen does not indicate that she was advised to not attend the hearing. Moreover, the respondent has not contested the ground of removability under section 237(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i), nor demonstrated eligibility for any form of relief, including voluntary departure which she mentioned briefly in the motion to reopen. We therefore conclude that the respondent has not shown prejudice based upon the alleged ineffectiveness of the unidentified individual.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Counsel for the respondent has not filed a separate written brief or statement, despite indicating on the Notice of Appeal that a brief would be submitted and despite seeking and receiving a briefing extension. We considered the statements on the Notice of Appeal as the basis of the respondent’s appeal, although they lack specificity. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(A), (E) (permitting summary dismissal in express situations, including failure to file a brief as indicated).

Under Matter of Lozada, supra, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by (1) an affidavit setting out the agreement entered into with counsel, (2) proof that notice of the allegations and an opportunity to respond has been provided to counsel whose representation was allegedly ineffective, and (3) the filing of a complaint with appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation for the failure to file a complaint. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (requiring prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions in addition to compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra).

IN RE: VICTOR MANUEL RAMIREZ-RAMIREZ
File: AXXX XX0 382 - Los Angeles, CA
June 14, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vera A. Weisz, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
In a decision dated May 10, 2011, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico after determining that he had not been cooperating with his attorney and was not eligible for relief other than voluntary departure; the Immigration Judge denied voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that his prior attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge failed to explore all of the respondent’s immigration remedies and poorly advised him, including telling him to inform the Immigration Judge that he needed more time because he was getting married, when in reality he was not (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 3, 6-8). He argues that his former attorney did not raise the issue of the respondent qualifying for a U visa and his counselor withdrew from the case when the respondent refused to make a false claim of political asylum (Respondent’s Br. at 6, 8).
 
The respondent does not claim to have met the procedural requirements for establishing a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish and include the following: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that the Lozada requirements “insures that the record contains the ‘essential information’ necessary to ‘evaluate the substance’ of the alien’s claim”).
 
While the respondent is correct that strict compliance with Lozada’s procedural requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not required in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, particularly where the record reflects a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel” (Respondent’s Br. at 6), we do not find this to be the case here. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The fact that the respondent did not comply with the Lozada requirements precludes any presumption that the respondent was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, although the respondent alleges that his prior counsel told him to lie to the Immigration Judge about getting married and advised him to file a false asylum application, there is no proof that his prior counsel was actively engaging in fraud. With such allegations, it would be particularly helpful if the respondent did notify his counsel of these allegations and submitted a response from the attorney in order to facilitate the evaluation of such conduct.
 
*2 Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the respondent was prejudiced by his former attorney’s actions such that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case or from applying for relief which would have been available to him. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that ineffective assistance of counsel results in a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment only when the proceeding is so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonable presenting his case); see also Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, 640 F.2d 1139, 1142 (9th Cir. 1981) (stating that legal strategies which are unwise in hindsight do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent has not established that the proceedings would have been different but for his counsel’s alleged unprofessional errors. The respondent’s prior counsel appears to have asked to withdraw from representing the respondent during a preliminary hearing but was asked to remain of counsel to give the respondent another opportunity to file applications for relief (Tr. at 17-19). At the next hearing, the respondent still had not presented any applications, after being explicitly informed by the Immigration Judge that this was his last continuance for filing applications (Tr. at 20-21), and his attorney again alleged a lack of cooperation as grounds for seeking withdrawal (Tr. at 22). The Immigration Judge then found the respondent’s applications abandoned and granted the respondent’s counsel’s request to withdraw (Tr. at 23, 25; I.J. at 2).
 
The respondent does not dispute that he did not submit any applications for relief when asked to by the Immigration Judge, and on appeal, he does not allege or establish that he is eligible for any relief. Therefore, we cannot conclude that, even assuming his attorney ineffective, there was prejudice. Although the respondent claims that his prior counsel should have established his eligibility for a U visa based on being a victim of a crime (Respondent’s Br. at 1-2, 8), the record does not contain sufficient evidence that the respondent would qualify for such a visa or that he has even applied for it. At any rate, we do not have jurisdiction to grant such relief. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012) (discussing how an alien establishes prima facie eligibility for a U visa and whether a remand or continuance is warranted to await adjudication of such relief).
 
Likewise, although the respondent asserts that he is eligible for “prosecutorial discretion” (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 8), the Board and the Immigration Judges do not have authority to influence or require the Department of Homeland Security to exercise its discretion in deciding which cases to prosecute or not. See Reno v. American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471, 488-91 (1999); Lopez-Telles v. INS, 564 F.2d 1302, 1304 (9th Cir. 1977). Although cancellation of removal was raised as a possible form of relief for which the respondent might be eligible (Tr. at 15), it was ultimately not pursued, and the respondent does not appear statutorily eligible for such relief (see Tr. at 24). See section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). Finally, it is not clear whether the respondent is statutorily eligible for voluntary departure, which the Immigration Judge denied as a matter of discretion (Tr. at 23; I.J. at 2), but the respondent does not raise this issue on appeal and, therefore, we decline to address it further.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kai W. Degraaf, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Johnston
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s January 18, 2011, oral decision which found her subject to removal as charged. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response on appeal in support of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2012). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgement and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, a 55-year-old native and citizen of Philippines, entered the United States in 2003 on a tourist’s visa. She eventually was hired as a live-in nanny by a United States citizen who led her to believe that she would assist her in becoming lawful permanent resident with the assistance of two prior attorneys. However, the petition for alien worker eventually was denied, and a Notice to Appear was issued in March 2009, which alleged that the respondent was subject to removal because she had overstayed her tourist visa. The respondent, through the same attorney who represents her on appeal, conceded the factual allegations and removability on August 31, 2010 (Tr. at 8).
 
On December 7, 2010, the respondent, through counsel, submitted a motion to terminate proceedings setting forth the preceding facts. He alleged that the respondent had been deprived of due process essentially because she had been misled by her employer and the prior attorneys and that the Notice to Appear had been “improvidently issued,” citing 8 C.F.R. § 239.2(a)(6). On December 8, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the motion via a preprinted order in which he had handwritten that the respondent “has already admitted the allegations and conceded removability as charged.”
 
At a hearing on January 18, 2011, the respondent, through counsel, requested a final order of removal in order that he could pursue the possibility of deferred action, and he conceded that the respondent was not eligible for any form of relief. Therefore, the Immigration Judge entered an order of removal on January 18, 2011.
 
The respondent filed a Notice of Appeal which indicated that she was appealing the Immigration Judge’s removal order of January 18, 2011. However, counsel has submitted a brief on appeal which reiterates the arguments contained in the motion to terminate and alleges again that the Notice to Appear was improvidently issued. The respondent essentially argues that she should not have been placed in removal proceedings because she received ineffective assistance of counsel, without any legal support for this position. In addition, she maintains that she should not be required to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) because the ineffective assistance in her case is plainly apparent.
 
*2 The respondent has misinterpreted the regulations and case law which permit the DHS or an Immigration Judge to cancel a Notice to Appear as improvidently issued. The regulations and case law do not permit an alien to request that a Notice to Appear be cancelled on this basis. See generally Matter of W-C-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 118 (BIA 2007); Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 239.2(a)(6), (c).
 
In the circumstances, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decisions of December 8, 2010, which denied the motion to terminate, and January 18, 2011, which ordered the respondent removed. The respondent was represented by competent counsel who conceded the factual allegations and removability, she has not established that she is eligible for any form of relief, or that she is not subject to removal as charged.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: LUIS BAUTISTA-RAMIREZ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Teresa Martinez-Alonso, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christina Playton
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; “vacate the execution of an order of removal;” stay of removal; change of venue
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated April 12, 2012, denying “Motion to Reconsider [,] Emergency Motion to Reopen, to Vacate the Execution of an Order of Removal, and Request for Stay of Removal and to Change Venue.” We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
After the respondent was served with a Notice to Appear in 2007, the Immigration Court sent a Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) to the respondent’s former counsel, Pascual Madrigal, informing him that a removal hearing had been scheduled on March 10, 2008. As the respondent did not appear at that hearing, he was ordered removed in absentia under the provisions of section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A).
 
On March 7, 2012, nearly 4 years after he was ordered removed in absentia, the respondent, through his present counsel, filed an “Emergency Motion to Reopen, to Vacate the Execution of an Order of Removal, and Request for Stay of Removal and to Change Venue.” While the respondent argued that he did not receive the NOH, he did not address the fact that the NOH was actually sent to Mr. Madrigal. As such, on March 19, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion was untimely under the general 90-day filing deadline governing motions to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act. Moreover, rescission of the order of removal entered against the respondent was not warranted on the basis of lack of notice as notice to an alien’s counsel of record satisfies the notice requirements set forth in section 239(a)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2)(A). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. The respondent did not allege that Mr. Madrigal did not receive the NOH. As the respondent did not timely appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion, his decision is now final. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38, 1003.39.
 
On April 3, 2012, the respondent filed a “Motion to Reconsider[,] Emergency Motion to Reopen, to Vacate the Execution of an Order of Removal, and Request for Stay of Removal and to Change Venue.” In his motion, the respondent argued that he was “forced” to file the prior motion due to his imminent removal, and, for the first time, argued that Mr. Madrigal engaged in ineffective assistance of counsel by not informing the respondent of his March 2008 removal hearing. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent sought reconsideration of the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the initial motion, the respondent has not demonstrated errors of law or fact in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). As discussed above, the respondent’s initial “Emergency Motion to Reopen, to Vacate the Execution of an Order of Removal, and Request for Stay of Removal and to Change Venue” was properly denied as it was untimely and the respondent had not demonstrated that rescission of the order of removal was warranted on the basis of lack of notice. While the respondent did raise, for the first time, a claim to reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, such claims did not warrant reconsideration. It is well-established that a motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied.1 See Omari v. Holder, 562 F.3d 314, 319 (5th Cir. 2009) (“A motion for reconsideration is thus confined to the substance of the [Board’s] original decision.”); Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (citing Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216, 219 (BIA 1990, 1991), for the proposition that “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion”). A motion to reconsider is not a mechanism by which a party may raise completely new arguments. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims were not properly raised in the context of a motion to reconsider as they did not “flow” from any arguments raised in his initial motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 57.
 
To the extent that the respondent sought reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that such claims were number-barred (I.J. at 1). Section 240(c)(7)(C)(A) of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provide an alien with a single opportunity to file a motion to reopen seeking to rescind of an order of removal entered in absentia. As the respondent used that opportunity when he filed his “Emergency Motion to Reopen, to Vacate the Execution of an Order of Removal, and Request for Stay of Removal and to Change Venue” on March 7, 2012, the respondent’s second motion, which is the subject of the current appeal, was number-barred. The respondent’s claim that he was “forced” to file his original motion does not amount to a cognizable basis to toll the clear statutory and regulatory limit to filing one motion to reopen on an equitable basis. We observe that, even though the respondent claimed that Mr. Madrigal was ineffective with respect to the respondent’s underlying removal proceedings, the respondent has not alleged that the attorney who filed his initial motion provided ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, we conclude that the respondent’s claims against Mr. Madrigal are number-barred. We decline to equitably toll the applicable numerical limit governing the respondent’s reopening claims.
 
*3 As neither the respondent’s reconsideration nor reopening claim was meritorious, his additional requests to “vacate the execution of an order of removal,” stay his removal, and change venue were also without merit. We observe that an alien seeking to vacate an order of removal under the provisions of section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act must bring such claims “upon a motion to reopen” as discussed above, the respondent’s second request for reopening was number-barred. Additionally, a change of venue was not warranted as no additional removal hearing are required in this matter.
 
Since taking this appeal, the respondent has filed additional evidence with this Board. Much of the evidence was previously filed with the Immigration Judge. Moreover, we do not consider evidence submitted on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (“The Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record.”). We also do not consider a party’s arguments which are raised for the first time on appeal. See Matter of Jimenez, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996) (noting that an issue which was neither raised before, nor ruled upon by the Immigration Judge, is not properly before us).
 
To the extent that the respondent’s additional evidence can be considered a motion to remand to the Immigration Judge to consider such evidence, the respondent’s claims are numerically barred as an alien is permitted an opportunity to file a single motion to reopen and a single motion to reconsider. See sections 240(c)(b)(A), (7)(A). In this case, the respondent has used both of those opportunities. As such, a request for a remand to consider the evidence in not permitted. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000) (recognizing that motions to remand filed after an administrative order has been issued are simply motions to reopen, and they are subject to the same numerical limitations as other motions to reopen).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent’s claims concerning his equities in this country, the ability to obtain relief from removal, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, can be construed as a request for sua sponte reconsideration or reopening, the respondent has not demonstrated that such measures are warranted in this case. The power to reconsider or reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
For the reasons set forth above, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s “Motion to Reconsider[,] Emergency Motion to Reopen, to Vacate the Execution of an Order of Removal, and Request for Stay of Removal and to Change Venue.”
 
*4 In light of this decision, we will vacate the stay of removal which was previously granted. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 108 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that the limited stay authority provides the opportunity to stay proceedings while a pending motion is adjudicated and terminates upon adjudication of the pending motion). At the present time, the order of removal entered against the respondent on March 10, 2008, by the Immigration Judge, serves as a valid basis upon which the respondent can be removed from this country. If the respondent seeks a stay of removal on the basis of humanitarian concerns, such a request must be made with the Department of Homeland Security. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The stay of removal entered by this Board on April 17, 2012, is vacated.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jon D. Staples
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 28, 2012, decision ordering his removal. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent has also filed a motion to reopen, which we construe as a motion to remand. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1999). We review findings of fact by the Immigration Judge for clear error, while all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
The respondent concedes that he was convicted of criminal sale of marijuana in violation of New York Penal Law § 221.40 (2004) and of unlawful possession of marijuana in violation of New York Penal Law § 221.05 (2004). However, the respondent challenges the validity of these convictions, and argues that the Immigration Judge should not have relied on such convictions in sustaining the above charges of removability. The respondent also challenges the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien who has any time after admission been convicted of a controlled substance violation, other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana. Although the respondent argues on appeal that he was not guilty as charged of the marijuana sale offense, it is well settled that neither an Immigration Judge nor this Board may look behind the fact of conviction and re-litigate the ultimate question of an alien’s guilt or innocence. See Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294 (BIA 1991). Similarly, although the respondent may assert that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during criminal proceedings, the respondent does not indicate that he has successfully pursued a collateral challenge to this offense in state court, and the conviction therefore supports a finding of removability in these proceedings. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). Finally, although the respondent states that his convictions may have been expunged from his criminal record pursuant to a rehabilitative statute, an alien remains convicted of an offense for immigration purposes pursuant to the definition of “conviction” set forth in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A), notwithstanding a subsequent vacatur under a state rehabilitative statute. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). For these reasons, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has been convicted of two controlled substance violations and is removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act.1
 
*2 We do not find merit in the respondent’s Motion to Reopen Deportation Proceedings.2 The respondent’s motion was initially filed with the Immigration Court during the pendency of this appeal. It was properly rejected by the Immigration Court because an Immigration Judge ceases to have jurisdiction over a motion to reopen at such time as jurisdiction vests with this Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). A “motion to reopen” is not properly before the Board as the respondent’s motion was filed during the pendency of the present appeal, and thus at a time when there was no administratively final order of removal in his case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1241.1. To the extent that we therefore construe the respondent’s motion as a motion to remand, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that remand is warranted. See Matter of Coelho, supra. While it appears that the respondent argues in his motion that he was inappropriately ordered removed in absentia, we note that the respondent was present and participated at his February 28, 2012, hearing. Further, although the respondent appears to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has not submitted evidence demonstrating compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (enumerating evidentiary requirements for a party to prevail upon an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). For these reasons, we conclude that the respondent has not shown that remand is warranted in this case. The respondent’s request for a stay or removal is moot, and the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

1

Because we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, we conclude that we need not reach the Immigration Judge’s aggravated felony determination. We note that the respondent, who was admitted in 2002, cannot establish eligibility for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), because his 2004 convictions preclude him from accruing the required continuous residence. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act.

2

We note that the respondent is in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, and not deportation proceedings under former section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 8, 2011, denying his request for a continuance and finding him removable as charged.1 During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent submitted new evidence that we construe as a motion to remand. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s request for a waiver of the filing fees associated with the appeal is granted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1), 1003.8. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.2
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have continued the proceedings since his post-conviction relief (“PCR”) was pending. He further argues that he entered defective guilty pleas due to ineffective assistance from his criminal counsel below, in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct 1473 (2010).3 The respondent contends that his constitutional rights were violated.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately went forward with the proceedings without granting the respondent an additional continuance (I.J. at 2-4; Tr. at 4-6 dated Mar. 8, 2011). The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Khan v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 448 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir. 2006); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355-57 (BIA 1983). In this case, the Immigration Judge had continued the proceedings from December 14, 2010, until March 8, 2011, based on the respondent’s testimony that his PCR case for the 2008 conviction had been granted (I.J. at 2-3; see, e.g., Tr. at 31-33 dated Jan. 3, 2011). However, at the March 2011 hearing, the respondent proffered evidence indicating that criminal counsel had been appointed and his PCR case was pending (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 1-3 dated Mar. 8, 2011). The record also reflects that the respondent intended to pursue PCR for his 2007 conviction (Tr. at 5 dated Mar. 8, 2011). Thus, as the respondent’s ability to prevail on his PCR case was speculative, the Immigration Judge appropriately denied his request for a continuance. To date, the respondent has not proffered evidence to suggest that his PCR case for the 2008 conviction will be successful.
 
*2 Further, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing PCR in the form of a collateral attack for his 2008 conviction in state criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Paredes v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 528 F.3d 196, 198-99 (3d Cir. 2008) (stating the pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks does not vitiate finality, unless and until the convictions are overturned as a result of the collateral motion); see also Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999). The respondent did not present evidence with this appeal that any attack on his 2008 conviction resulted in any vacatur. Likewise, there is no evidence that the respondent’s 2007 conviction has been vacated. In Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, the United States Supreme Court ruled that an attorney representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s appellate assertions that his convictions are invalid, in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality of his convictions for immigration purposes, unless and until they are overturned by the criminal court.4 See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992); Matter of Ponce De Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 157 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1996). In other words, we are bound by the conviction records and we have no authority to vacate the convictions before us as the judgements do not appear to be a void on their face.
 
The record also does not support the respondent’s contentions that his constitutional rights were violated. To establish a violation of due process, the respondent must demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced from the alleged procedural errors. See Leslie v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 611 F.3d 171, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2010); Khan v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., supra, at 236. Here, the respondent was afforded a fair hearing to present his claims for relief. The Immigration Judge had continued the proceedings to determine the status of the respondent’s PCR case. The Immigration Judge had also determined that the respondent was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, that he did not express any fears of persecution or torture if removed to Jamaica, and that he had misplaced his passport and was unable to pay for his travel (Tr. at 3-4, 6 dated Mar. 8, 2011). Based on this record, the respondent did not demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by the Immigration Judge, and therefore, we find no violation of due process.
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
To the extent the respondent seeks to apply for voluntary departure under section 240B(b), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) and proffers new evidence, we construe it as a motion to remand and we deny the motion. Motions to remand are adjudicated under the same standards as are motions to reopen. See Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880, 884 (BIA 1994). Such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to remand must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen where the respondent seeks to present new evidence, but will only be granted if the new evidence “would likely change the result in the case.” See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992).
 
Although the respondent now asserts that his fiancee holds his passport and that his family can pay for his travel, he has not established by clear and convincing evidence that he has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so. See section 240B(b)(D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c). The respondent bears the burden of proof to establish eligibility for voluntary departure. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.8(d); 1240.26(c). Aside from the respondent’s conclusory statements, the proffered statements from the respondents’s brother, cousin, father, grandmother, uncle, co-worker, and friends, do not demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent has the financial means to depart voluntarily and intends to do so. See also Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 20 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999). Rather, the proffered statements suggest that the respondent seeks another opportunity to remain in the United States. In his most recent submission filed with the Board on May 4, 2012, the respondent did not present any further evidence to establish that he is prima facie eligible for voluntary departure. Thus, we will deny the respondent’s motion.
 
Due to the nature of our disposition of this matter, we need not address the respondent’s other arguments on appeal and we find no basis to remand this case for further proceedings. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (stating as a general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 465 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*4 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

The Board issued an interim order on March 30, 2012, vacating its prior decisions dated August 11, 2011, and October 17, 2011, and reinstating the respondent’s appeal.

The respondent does not challenge the portion of the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding his removability, his fears of persecution or torture if removed to Jamaica, or that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 2-4; Exh. 1). We consider these issues to be waived. See Lie v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 530, 532 n.1 (3d Cir. 2005); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196-97 n.4 (BIA 1990).

The record reflects that the respondent was convicted for Theft by Unlawful Taking or Disposition, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:20-3a in 2007, and for Receiving Stolen Property, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:20-7 in 2008 (Exhs. 1, 2; Tr. at 13-15 dated Nov. 23, 2010).

We note that the respondent has not complied with, nor attempted to pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Fadiga v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 488 F.3d 142, 153 (3d Cir. 2007).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Michael T. Purcell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Grace H. Cheung
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents are natives and citizens of South Korea. This proceeding involved Leland Sustaire, a former federal government employee who obtained lawful permanent resident status for a number of aliens, including the respondents here, even though there was no underlying basis for such status (Exhs. 4-5). The respondents conceded removability and did not seek any relief so the Immigration Judge ordered them removed.
 
The respondents appealed and on March 27, 2006, the Board dismissed the respondents’ appeals. The respondents filed a timely petition for review. On August 10, 2011, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the petition for review. Chee et al. v. Holder, No. 06-71952 (9th Cir. Aug. 8, 2011). The Ninth Circuit held that equitable estoppel against the government was not available where the respondents did not lose any rights to which they were entitled. The Ninth Circuit held that the respondents’ remaining contentions were not persuasive.
 
After receiving the 9th Circuit’s decision, the respondents hired new counsel and on November 17, 2011, they filed a motion to reopen our March 2006 decision. The motion is untimely. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
In the motion, the lead male respondent (AXXX XXX XXX) and his wife (AXXX XXX XXX) request that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. Their children (AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX), as well as AXXX XXX XXX on their behalf, contend that their former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel because they were unaware that they qualified for post-conclusion voluntary departure, and had they known that they qualified, they would have insisted that their former counsel request it, rather than withdraw the request. In addition, AXXX XXX XXX seeks sua sponte reopening so that he may pursue adjustment of status based on an pending I-130 visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion.
 
The motion will be denied as untimely. The respondents AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX do not contend that ineffective assistance by former counsel is apparent on the face of the record. As such, the respondents had to substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondents attached a complaint and cover letter, but they did not submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that a complaint was filed with the appropriate bar office. The respondents did not attach, or supplement the record, with the certified mail receipt, the return receipt, or an acknowledgment letter from the state bar.
 
*2 Furthermore, even assuming substantial compliance with Lozada, the respondents have not demonstrated that former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondents claim that they were not aware of their eligibility for voluntary departure, and that they would have requested such relief had they been aware. Such an assertion comes 5 years after the Board dismissed the appeal. In light of the record and former counsel’s response, see DHS Opposition, Exh. A, their assertions are inherently not believable. Former counsel states that the respondents AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX did not want to pursue voluntary departure because they wanted to stay and apply for relief (DHS Opposition, Exh. A).
 
According to the transcript of proceedings, former counsel declined voluntary departure on the respondents’ behalf and did not seek any other applications for relief such as adjustment of status based on their labor because they were not eligible for adjustment at the time, but they hoped to seek relief in the future (Tr. at 147-48). Respondents, by their own admissions, were present during this discussion. Further, the respondents did not have a basis for asylum, withholding or protection under the Convention Against Torture (Tr. at 149). Their former counsel’s strategic decisions did not constitute ineffective assistance, but rather a strategic decision based on his understanding of the respondents’ wishes during the proceedings. Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1101 (9th Cir. 2009) (care must be taken to not distort a lawyer’s decisions with the benefit of hindsight).
 
Given the respondents’ (AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX) desire to remain in the United States and their hope to adjust their status, it was a reasonable litigation tactic to withdraw the pending voluntary departure requests as a failure to comply with the stringent time constraints of voluntary departure would result in a bar on adjustment, among other restrictions, for 10 years. Section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d).
 
The respondents AXXX XXX XXX, AXXX XXX XXX, and AXXX XXX XXX seek reopening as a matter of discretion. We decline to exercise our sua sponte discretion to reopen because the respondents have not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Becoming eligible for adjustment subsequent to a final administrative order of removal is not unusual and is not by itself an exceptional circumstance.
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 2, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found her ineligible for relief from removal based on her criminal convictions. Removability is not at issue on appeal. On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent requested a continuance to collaterally attack the conviction pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. __, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010),1 but the Immigration Judge denied that request (Tr. at 9-10; I.J. at 3). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted her a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The respondent alleges that she was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and she has filed a motion to vacate it. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).2 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel.

2

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

File: AXXX XX4 461 - New Orleans, LA
May 31, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent has filed an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 24, 2012, decision granting him voluntary departure. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The hearing transcript reveals that the respondent, through counsel, requested only the relief of pre-conclusion voluntary departure for a period of 90 days (Tr. at 7-10), a grant of which requires that the alien waive “appeal of all issues.” Section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (holding that 120 days’ voluntary departure may not be granted prior to the completion of removal proceedings without an express waiver of the right to appeal). The transcript further reflects that, after explaining the order, the Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s counsel whether the respondent waived appeal, to which the respondent’s counsel responded “He does, Your Honor.” (Tr. at 10, lines 9-12).
 
On February 23, 2012, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), contending that he was not advised during the proceedings that he was required to waive his appeal rights in order to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure; and he did not receive an adequate explanation regarding the ramifications of waiving appeal. However, as set out above, the respondent, with counsel present, was explicitly advised that he was required to waive his appeal rights in order to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure. See Kohwarienv. Holder, 635F. 3d 174 (5th Cir. 2011) (finding that an alien accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure knowingly and intelligently waived his appellate rights). To the extent the respondent’s appeal can be construed as alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, he has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
Consequently, the respondent, through counsel, knowingly and intelligently waived appeal. The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and that decision remains the final administrative order in these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) (final sentence), 1003.39 (finality of order); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Claire W. Matecko
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Egypt, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated February 28, 2011, denying his motion to reconsider. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on October 6, 1998. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(6)(A). On October 27, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. On December 2, 2010, the Immigration Court mailed the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated December 1, 2010, denying the motion to reopen to the parties. On January 4, 2011, 33 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen was mailed, the respondent filed a “Motion to Reconsider Reopening Removal Proceedings” wherein he “move[d] for reconsideration of his motion to reopen removal proceedings” (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 2).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge properly recognized that the respondent’s motion to reconsider was untimely as it was filed more than 30 days after the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen (I.J. at 2). See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reconsider was untimely. See Claudio v. Holder, 601 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that once an alien elects in his notice of appeal to file a brief, that brief becomes the operative document through which any issues that the alien wishes to have considered must be raised). While the respondent does claim that his removal would result in hardship to his family and he has other equities in the United States, the power to reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). As such, sua sponte reconsideration was not warranted.
 
On appeal, the respondent attempts to challenge the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. For example, he argues that the untimeliness of his motion to reopen was justified, that his motion to reopen complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and that he is eligible to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (Respondent’s Br. at 1-5).1 However, the respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. As such, any arguments concerning the merits of the motion to reopen are not properly before us. Instead, the only decision currently before us for the purposes of appellate review is the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated February 28, 2011, which properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider as untimely. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Evelyn G. Zneimer, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 On June 10, 2010, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent a period of voluntary departure in lieu of removal, and the respondent waived appeal. The Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen proceedings on June 21, 2011. On March 7, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied a motion for reconsideration of the denial of reopening, considering relevant case law and allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s appeal of the denial of reconsideration was received on April 9, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal.
 
The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on March 7, 2012. The appeal was accordingly due on or before April 6, 2012. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on April 9, 2012. We find that the appeal is untimely, and the respondent has provided no explanation for the untimeliness of the appeal. The Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15 (1999).
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Parker Waggaman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of India, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on April 27, 2010, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on May 27, 2010, that was denied by an Immigration Judge on July 7, 2010. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on February 9, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied it on February 24, 2012, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). These proceedings fall within the REAL ID Act.
 
The respondent’s second motion to reopen is untimely. A request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Because the second request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration. The respondent also does not assert that he was not notified of his hearing.
 
We note that the respondent argued in his first motion, through a former attorney, that he was unable to attend his April 27, 2010, hearing, because he was in India. The respondent asserts on appeal that he was not outside the United States, and it constituted ineffective assistance of counsel for his former attorney to have made that assertion in his first motion. However, the respondent does not explain either on appeal or in his motions his reason for not attending his hearing. He therefore would not have established that “exceptional circumstances” or lack of notice prevented his appearance. We thus do not find that it would be warranted to reopen these proceedings even assuming that his second motion to reopen was filed timely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reopen must state the new facts that will be proven at the reopened hearing and be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). An alien who seeks to remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a heavy burden of proving that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
For the first time on appeal, the respondent alleges that an individual who is not a member of the State Bar of Texas purported to represent him at a scheduling hearing, and for that reason, his counsel of record was uninformed concerning the next pertinent date in the proceedings, causing him to miss a critical deadline. First, the respondent himself was present at the hearing where the Immigration Judge provided the date at issue (Tr. at 9-10). The heavy burden for prevailing on a motion to reopen cannot be shifted away from the respondent due to his failure to relate this information to his counsel of record. Next, the respondent made no effort to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), with respect to any ineffective assistance of counsel claim he intended to pursue. Finally, respondent’s counsel of record was on notice, due to the lapse of time, that some intervening court action might have occurred, but failed to investigate. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen warrants denial, as he did not establish that new information affected the outcome of his case. Matter of Coelho, supra
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sarah Owings, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of the Dominican Republic. On November 22, 2011, an Immigration Judge granted him the opportunity to depart the United States voluntarily by January 23, 2012, under safeguards. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on January 17, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied it on February 27, 2012, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). These proceedings fall within the REAL ID Act.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen. He disputes the Immigration Judge’s finding that he did not substantially comply with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Dakane v. U.S. Atty.Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005).
 
Even assuming that the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for his claim, he must also establish that his former counsel’s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged on the fundamental fairness of the hearing. See Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011). It is required that he establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s alleged ineffectiveness. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not established that he was prima facie eligible for a grant of any form of relief from removal at his hearing other than voluntary departure. In fact, the respondent does not even address the issue with particularity in either his brief or the Notice of Appeal. Instead, the respondent’s contentions are limited to whether he satisfied the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. He has therefore not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s representation.
 
*2 We acknowledge that the respondent asserted in his motion to reopen that his former counsel’s inaction deprived him of the opportunity to be considered at the hearing for a “stand alone” waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(h) (See motion at 5). However, he is not eligible to be granted the waiver.
 
In Matter of Abosi and Matter of Sanchez, the Board found that an alien could apply for a “stand alone” 212(h) waiver, where the alien was a returning legal permanent resident seeking to overcome a ground of inadmissibility. However, an alien, like the respondent, who is within the United States and charged with deportability must submit an application for a 212(h) waiver concurrently with an application for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status. See section 212(h)(2) of the Act (a waiver of inadmissibility is permitted where the ““““Attorney General ... has consented to the alien’s applying or reapplying for a visa, for admission to the United States, or adjustment of status); 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(f) (“an application under this part shall be the sole method of requesting the exercise of discretion under sections 212(g), (h), (i), and (k) as they relate to the inadmissibility of an alien in the United States”).
 
The respondent is not an alien seeking admission into the United States and would not be applying for the waiver of inadmissibility in conjunction was an application for adjustment of status. In fact, the respondent acknowledges in his motion that he could not adjust his status to a lawful permanent resident of the United States in the foreseeable future because of his visa priority date. We do not find that the respondent established that he was denied a fair hearing warranting reopening of these proceedings. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel P. Hanlon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 By a motion filed on December 6, 2011, the respondent seeks to have the proceedings reopened based upon his assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
An alien’s right to due process can be violated by “egregious conduct that threatens the fairness of the proceeding,” including egregiously deficient performance by the alien’s lawyer. Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096 (9th Cir. 2009), citing Nehad v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 962, 967, 971 (9th Cir. 2008); accord Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 933 (9th Cir.1986). Therefore, in assessing an attorney’s performance, “[t]he proper focus of our inquiry is whether the proceeding is so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting her case.” Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 974 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). An alien must also show “substantial prejudice” by demonstrating that “the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id. at 973; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec.553, 560 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent’s assertion of ineffective assistance is lodged against an attorney who was disbarred in 2010, Anita C. Kanu. A review of the transcript of proceedings raises serious concerns as to the representation afforded the respondent by that attorney. See Tr. at pp.40, 43, 55; I.J. Dec. at p. 2. Further, the respondent’s affidavit, which we accept as true for purposes of this motion (see Najmabadi v. Holder, 597 F.3d 983, 994 (9th Cir. 2010)), details that his former attorney continued to mishandle his case resulting in the decision of the Board of December 29, 2006, dismissing the respondent’s appeal and denying his motion to remand, noting that, “[w]hile the respondent has submitted a copy of his marriage certificate, the respondent has failed to provide proof that his United States citizen spouse filed a visa petition (Form I-130) on his behalf, submit an application for adjustment of status (Form I-485), or provide evidence establishing the bona fides of his marriage.” Further, the record reflects that Ms. Kanu improperly filed an application for suspension of deportation in these removal proceedings, and the Immigration Judge would have entertained a motion to reopen to apply for cancellation of removal, but no such motion was filed. Following the Board’s decision, the respondent continued to pursue his case with other representatives, ultimately learning of the extent of the mishandling of his proceedings by Ms. Kanu.
 
*2 We find that the respondent relied on the prior attorney to his detriment. Given the evidence of record and the detailed arguments presented in support of the motion, we find that an adequate showing of due diligence has been made so as to warrant equitable tolling and the reopening of these proceedings. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
Therefore, we will grant the respondent’s unopposed motion to reopen and we will remand the record to the Immigration Court so that the respondent may be afforded a hearing on any application for relief that may be available to him. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel E. Marcus, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 1, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion for a continuance to seek post-conviction relief.1 The Immigration Judge properly denied the request for failure to demonstrate good cause because the outcome of any efforts to obtain post-conviction relief, including a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), would be speculative, and the respondent’s conviction is considered final for immigration purposes unless and until it is overturned. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240; Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n.8 (BIA 2009) (“A pending collateral attack does not disturb the finality of a conviction and therefore would not justify reopening of removal proceedings.”); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992) (“the possibility of a decision on any post-conviction motion that has been filed does not affect our finding that the respondent is deportable.”); see also Lanferman v. BIA, 576 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir. 2009) (a collateral attack on alien’s state court conviction is not available a petition for review of the Board’s removal order).2
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent conceded the removal charges against her and sought no other form of relief (Tr. at 8-14; Exh. 2).

2

The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in ruling that the motion to reopen her criminal case was merely a collateral matter having no direct relevance to her removal proceeding (Brief at 5-6). However, the term “collateral attack” in this context is used in its legal sense, i.e., an attempt to attack the validity of a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct appeal.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Agnieszka Haupt, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scot A. Bearup
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents, both natives and citizens of Poland, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 20, 2010, which denied their request for a continuance but granted voluntary departure under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. The request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance. Although the respondents argue on appeal that there was good cause to grant a continuance based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in visa petition proceedings, they have not filed, either before the Immigration Judge or the Board, any documents showing that they are pursuing the ineffective assistance claim or that such a claim is factually supported. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In any event, inasmuch as the alleged ineffective assistance relates to an employment-based visa petition, such matter is outside the scope of the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s jurisdiction. See Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b), 1240.1(a)(1).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that any possible favorable change in immigration law is speculative. Moreover, to date, the respondents have not filed an application for relief or otherwise identified any relief from removal for which they may be eligible. Thus, the respondents have not shown that there was good cause for a continuance or that the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance resulted in actual prejudice. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. See Al-Ghorbani v. Holder, 585 F.3d 980, 992 (6th Cir. 2009). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fail to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondents file a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondents file any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondents file a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barbara K. Strickland, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kori LaPoint
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala who was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on November 4, 2010, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated July 6, 2011, denying his motion to reopen these removal proceedings, which was filed with the Immigration Judge on May 2, 2011. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely under the general 90-day rule governing motions to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Nonetheless, an order of removal entered in absentia can be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances.” See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. In removal proceedings, the term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.1 Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
We agree with the respondent that the reasonableness of an alien’s cause for not appearing at his hearing is not dispositive as to whether an in absentia order of removal should be rescinded under the provisions of section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. Instead, the question that must be resolved is whether the alien has demonstrated that the reasons for his failure to appear amount to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) of the Act.
 
In this case, the respondent argues that he made a “mistake” and a “mundane misunderstanding” and was “confused” regarding the date of his removal hearing. Even though the Notice of Hearing advised that the respondent’s “case has been scheduled for a[n] individual hearing before the Immigration Court on Nov 4, 2010,” it appears that the respondent argues that he was confused as the hearing notice was issued on December 23, 2009, and he believed that his hearing was scheduled for December 2010. However, the Immigration Judge properly recognized that such claims did not amount to exceptional circumstances warranting rescission of the order of removal entered against the respondent. See Valencia-Fragoso v. INS, 321 F.3d 1204, 1205-06 (9th Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (finding no exceptional circumstances where the alien misunderstood the time of her hearing). The respondent’s claims are far less compelling than battery, extreme cruelty, serious illness, or death. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent attempts to place blame on an employee of his attorney’s law office, we observe that the respondent has explicitly declined to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Respondent’s Br. at 2). Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that the ability to properly understand the Notice of Hearing, despite incorrect information from his attorney’s law office, was beyond his control. In any event, his claims are not sufficiently compelling to warrant rescission of the Immigration Judge’s order of removal
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that he is eligible for relief under special rule cancellation of removal pursuant to section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193, 2096, amended by Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644(1997) (“NACARA”), we observe that the record does not contain any evidence that he has filed an application for that form of relief. Thus, there is no support in the record for the respondent’s claims that “it is exceedingly likely that he would have prevailed on his NACARA special rule cancellation application” (Respondent’s Br. at 5). He makes no argument concerning the viability of his application for asylum. Moreover, the plain language of section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act requires that “exceptional circumstances” caused the alien’s failure to appear. A mere showing of generalized “exceptional circumstances” unrelated to the alien’s reasons for failing to appear at his removal hearing does not warrant rescission of a removal order under the provisions of section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The aliens described in Singh v. INS, 295 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2002), Chete Juarez v. Ashcroft, 376 F.3d 944 (9th Cir. 2004), and Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999), were in deportation proceedings. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the original opinion in Vukmirovic v. Holder, 621 F.3d 1043 (9th Cir. 2010), “constituted a departure from Ninth Circuit precedent and interpreted too broadly the ‘exceptional circumstances’ safe harbor for aliens removed in absentia.” Vukmirovic v. Holder, 640 F.3d 977, 978 (9th Cir. 2011).

The respondent does not allege that the Immigration Judge should have reopened these proceedings under his sua sponte authority. Even if such claim was made, we would conclude that sua sponte reopening is not warranted. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).

Margaret R. Kugel
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 Before us for decision is the respondent’s motion to reopen seeking an opportunity to apply for special rule cancellation of removal under section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193, 2196, amended by Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (1997) (NACARA). The motion, which is opposed by the DHS, will be denied.
 
The instant motion (filed December 1, 2011), is untimely by more than 9 years. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); August 9, 2002, Board dec. (final administrative decision).2 There also has been no showing that at the late filing of this motion is excused. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i)-(iv).
 
In addition, we decline to reopen the respondent’s proceedings sua sponte, inasmuch as he has not demonstrated the existence of exceptional circumstances warranting such action. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). Further, notwithstanding the currently-advanced assertions to the contrary, the respondent, a citizen of El Salvador, has not shown prima facie eligibility for special rule cancellation of removal.3 He entered the United States in March 1985, and therefore is an “ABC class member.” See American Baptist Churches, et al. v. Thornburgh, et al., 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (ABC); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.60. However, there has been no additional evidentiary showing that he is a “registered ABC class member,” as defined in 8 C.F.R. § 1240.60 (requiring a person, such as the respondent, to have registered for ABC benefits with the former INS, or to have applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS),4 on or before October 31, 1991). As such, he does not qualify as a section 203 NACARA principal applicant under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.61(a)(1). Further, the respondent has not established that he applied for asylum or before April 1, 1990, such that he qualifies as a principal applicant for such relief under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.61(a)(2).
 
*2 Insofar as it is also asserted that the respondent received ineffective assistance by his former attorney, this allegation has been advanced only by Mr. Chukwurah, not by the respondent himself. See Respondent’s Response to Government’s Opposition to Motion to Reopen at 2. Moreover, in moving to reopen the respondent has not submitted any evidence reflecting his compliance with the requirements for presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as moot.

Attorney Cyril O. Chukwurah (who filed the respondent’s Motion to Reopen, as well as his Response to Government’s Opposition to Motion to Reopen) has been suspended from practice before the Board, the Immigration Judges, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As Mr. Chukwurah is not permitted to practice law before the Board at this time, today’s order is being sent directly to the respondent, with a copy being provided to Mr. Chukwurah. Please also see the attached copy of the order suspending Mr. Chukwurah from practice.

2

In light of this determination, we need not address the parties’ arguments as to whether this motion also is untimely pursuant to other provisions governing special motions to reopen for section 203 NACARA relief. See DHS Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 5; Respondent’s Response to Government’s Opposition to Motion to Reopen.

3

It is now asserted that the respondent did not realize that NACARA relief was available to him, and that he did not have an opportunity to present his NACARA application, at his hearing. See Motion to Reopen at 3. However, the record establishes that the Immigration Judge questioned the respondent regarding his eligibility for such relief, and also discussed this issue with his attorney (Tr. at 5-7, 14). In his decision, the Immigration Judge noted that no proof of the respondent’s eligibility for section 203 NACARA relief was submitted. I.J. at 4.

4

It is also asserted that the respondent “was accorded TPS.” See Motion to Reopen at 2. No documentation has been provided confirming that the respondent has been granted TPS status. In any event, it has not been shown that he applied for TPS on or before October 31, 1991, to qualify as a “registered ABC class member,” and therefore as a principal applicant for special rule cancellation of removal under section 203 of the NACARA and 8 C.F.R. § 1240.61(a)(1). We separately note that if the respondent has been granted TPS, his order of removal cannot be executed until his TPS has expired. See generally Matter of Sosa-Ventura, 25 I&N Dec. 391, 396 (BIA 2010).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 21, 2011, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 28, 2010, denial of his request for a continuance. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen proceedings on December 27, 2011. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel in his previous proceedings because his counsel before the Immigration Judge failed to timely apply for withholding of removal, failed to obtain a bond for the respondent, and failed to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision. He further argues that his attorney before the Board was not licensed as an attorney in the state of Texas, and also argues that she failed to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim during the appeal process. In support of his argument, the respondent has submitted an affidavit, a copy of the client agreement between himself and Ronald Higgins, Esquire, and evidence that he has filed complaints against both of his prior attorneys. The respondent has also filed evidence that he has pursued post-collateral relief regarding his conviction.
 
Notwithstanding this evidence, we do not find that the respondent has demonstrated prejudice as a result of his attorneys’ actions. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not submitted evidence that he contracted with his first attorney to represent him on appeal, and inasmuch as this Board accepted the respondent’s untimely brief and considered his appeal on the merits, we do not find that he was prejudiced by any change in representation. Moreover, the respondent has not submitted an agreement with his prior appellate counsel.
 
Further, the respondent has failed to file an application for withholding of removal, as required by the regulations governing motions to reopen, nor has he set forth any kind of persecution claim. See § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by his first attorney’s failure to pursue withholding of removal on his behalf, or by his appellate attorney’s failure to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent has also not demonstrated how he was affected by his appellate attorney’s licensure in New York rather than Texas, and the respondent has submitted insufficient evidence regarding the nature of his representation during his bond proceedings. Lastly, we note that while the respondent has proffered documentation that he has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, he has not submitted any indication that the Court changed the disposition of his conviction in alignment with Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003); see also Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007).
 
*2 Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to grant the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen proceedings based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of Assaad, supra. The motion will, thus, be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Teodora Arias, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia M. Medeiros
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On March 15, 2012, the respondent submitted an untimely motion to reopen proceedings in which his appeal was dismissed by the Board on March 28, 2008. He also seeks a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes reopening. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent asks that he be considered for “prosecutorial discretion” pursuant to the “Morton Memorandum” of November 17, 2011 (Motion at 3). He further contends that his attorney, Mr. Pollack, did not inform him of the Board’s adverse decision. However, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor has he made any showing of prejudice, and reopening on this basis is not warranted. Rranci v. Att’y Gen., 540 F.3d 165, 172 (3d Cir. 2008) (outlining those requirements); Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 129 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that “the Lozada requirements are a reasonable exercise of the Board’s discretion”).
 
The respondent further avers he is a “perfect candidate for prosecutorial discretion” as outlined in the “Morton Memorandum” (Motion at 3). However, this Board is not authorized to take action on such a request. Rather, a request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion can be directed to the DHS. While the respondent also cites humanitarian factors in asking that proceedings be reopened, these factors do not constitute an exception to the statutory time limitation.
 
As the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is exempt from the time limits on motions to reopen, neither reopening nor a stay of removal is warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Danny C. Campbell, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Vietnam, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated June 18, 2010. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s June 7, 2010, motion to reopen, determining that there is “no legal basis” upon which to reopen the proceedings (I.J.). We agree. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for the reasons stated therein. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) (2011). We write separately for two reasons. First, to the extent the respondent has accused her prior counsel of providing her with bad legal advice, she has not made an effective allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel; she has not complied with the standards for such claims set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988). Finally, although the respondent has claimed that her removal will result in “extreme hardship,” she has not supported the motion to reopen with any application for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Accordingly, the following order will be entered:

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Barsamian, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Kenya. In a decision issued May 9, 2000, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent filed a motion to reopen. She conceded that she had notice of the hearing, but averred that she was unable to travel due to illness. The Immigration Judge denied the motion because the respondent had not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. The respondent filed a Notice of Appeal, and on April 20, 2001, the Board dismissed the appeal.
 
Over 11 years later, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. She alleges that the time within which to reopen should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel. She also seeks reopening under the Board’s sua sponte discretionary authority. The motion to reopen is denied as untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent has not satisfied the requirements of equitable tolling. She has not demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 745-46 (4th Cir. 2006). Nor has the respondent demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. See Chao v. Virginia Department of Transportation, 291 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir. 2002)(equitable tolling is not available when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf).
 
The limited evidence proffered with the motion, considered with the other evidence of record, does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on February 27, 2012, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2011, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed from the United States. On March 15, 2012, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider and reopen with the Board alleging that his former counsel did not file an appellate brief on his behalf.1 The respondent also claims that his current counsel will file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea with the Lawrence District Court. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.2
 
To the extent the motion is a motion to reconsider, it does not specify errors of fact or law in our former decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (stating that a motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.”); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). To the extent the motion is a motion to reopen, it is not supported with the requisite evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (stating that a motion to reopen “shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.”). The respondent’s counsel’s statements in the brief are not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998). Accordingly, the following order is entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Floyd J. Fernandez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On June 22, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on July 26, 2007. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent claimed that she did not receive proper notice of her removal hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). On April 29, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision, noting that the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was sent to the respondent at the address she provided. On November 2, 2011, the respondent filed the instant untimely motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(i). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent, who sought and continues to seek adjustment of status as the spouse of a United States citizen, raises ineffective assistance of counsel claims in the instant motion. Although she alleges that her former attorneys performed deficiently in both visa petition and removal proceedings, we emphasize that visa petition proceedings are separate and distinct from these removal proceedings. The dispositive issue now before the Board is whether ineffective assistance of counsel prevented the respondent from attending the scheduled removal hearing on July 26, 2007.
 
An alien may move to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal at any time if she did not receive proper notice. See section 240(c)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. An alien may also move to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal within 180 days after date of the in absentia order if she establishes that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances. See section 240(c)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent now seeks to toll the filing deadline in light of her claim that she did not receive the NTA due to ineffective assistance of counsel.1 See Motion to Reopen at 3.
 
The respondent claims that her former attorney, Rateb Khasawneh, received a copy of the NTA in May 2006, and that he failed to notify her of the scheduled removal hearing. Id., at 6-7. She also alleges that Emmanuel Olawale, Esquire, the attorney who filed the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge and the appeal before the Board, failed to raise the issue of Rateb Khasawneh’s alleged failure regarding the NTA. See Motion Exhibit A-2, at 2-3.
 
Initially, we find that the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel before this Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725, 727 (6th Cir. 2007) (“An alien who fails to comply with Lozada’s requirements forfeits her ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim”). We find no evidence of Rateb Khasawneh’s representation of the respondent in the record, and we find no evidence of the respondent’s compliance with Lozada’s requirements with regard to her claim of ineffective of counsel against him. With regard to her claim against Attorney Olawale, the respondent has not offered evidence that she filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities against Attorney Olawale in compliance with Lozada’s requirements. We further note that in his response to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Attorney Olawale explains that he learned from the respondent after the dismissal of her appeal that Rateb Khasawneh had received a copy of the NTA. Attorney Olawale disputes the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 In sum, the respondent has not set forth viable claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, even if the respondent had complied with Lozada’s requirements, and even if she had shown (which she has not) that she suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, equitable tolling is not appropriate because the respondent has not shown that she has acted with due diligence in bringing her ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board. See Barry v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 721, 724 (6th Cir. 2008). We note that in making her initial motion to reopen to rescind, no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was made.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent concedes that she was no longer living at her address of record at the time the NTA was mailed to her. See Respondent’s Motion at 4-5. She specifically claims that she did not receive the NTA because she had moved. Id. Although she states that she notified the U.S. Postal Service that she had moved, the respondent has neither claimed nor provided evidence that she notified the Department of Homeland Security of her change of address.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrew Brown
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States without inspection by an immigration officer, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated January 10, 2012, ordering his removal from this country. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
It is undisputed that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States as a result of his manner of entry into this country (I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 1).1 See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). As the respondent is subject to removal, it is his burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). On appeal, the respondent does not allege that he is eligible for any form of relief from removal that can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to enter an order of removal in this matter in lieu of further continuing proceedings. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. An Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance will not be overturned unless the respondent establishes that the denial deprived him of his due process right to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996) (citing Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987)).
 
In this case, the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear on June 17, 2011 (Exh. 1). The respondent was granted continuances on July 21, 2011 (Tr. at 2), August 22, 2011 (Tr. at 4, 9-10), November 3, 2011 (Tr. at 12), November 29, 2011 (Tr. at 13), and January 3, 2012 (Tr. at 15). Additionally, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s written motion for a continuance in October 2011.
 
Despite having been afforded a significant amount of time to prepare for his removal proceedings, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have further continued removal proceedings as he desires to apply for a U visa with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(U) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U), he had recently hired an unnamed “new attorney,” and that his prior counsel was ineffective. The respondent argues that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance by not appearing at scheduled hearings and not properly presenting and pursuing his claim for a U visa.2
 
*2 USCIS has “sole jurisdiction” over all applications for U visa status and an alien who is subject to a final order of removal is not precluded from filing such an application. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). Additionally, 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii) explicitly provides that, while the pendency of an application for a U visa has no effect on the Government’s authority to execute a removal order, an applicant for a U visa is permitted to file a request for a stay of removal with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). If USCIS approves the respondent’s application, he may file a motion to reopen and terminate removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(5)(i). Even if the respondent departs the United States, he may also pursue his application from abroad. 8 C.F.R. §214.14(c)(5)(i)(B). Considering the significant number of procedural safeguards which are in place in order to allow an alien a reasonable opportunity to pursue a U visa subsequent to an order of removal being entered against him, as well as the significant amount of time that was already provided to the respondent to pursue a U visa, we do not consider the speculative possibility that the respondent will be granted a U visa to be good cause to further continue these proceedings.3 See generally Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 110 (BIA 2009) (“As a practical matter, Immigration Judges and the Board have limited and finite adjudicative and administrative resources, and those resources are best allocated to matters over which we do have jurisdiction.”).
 
While the respondent claims that he had recently hired new counsel, he does not state the name of the representative that he allegedly hired, he has not presented any evidence to support such claims, and has not explained why these removal proceedings should have been continued in order for this unnamed attorney to enter an appearance. As discussed above, the respondent does not dispute that he is subject to removal from the United States and does not allege eligibility for any form of relief from removal that can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board. As such, the respondent’s claims concerning a “new attorney” do not establish that a further continuance was warranted. Such claims are also insufficient to establish that the unnamed attorney was ineffective.
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that his former counsel was ineffective, we observe that the respondent has not presented (1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with his former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) evidence that his former counsel has been informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) any indication as to whether a complaint against his former counsel has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*3 Additionally, the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do not amount to a basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision as the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s conduct. See Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011). Given that the respondent does not dispute that he is subject to removal from the United States and does not allege eligibility for any form of relief that can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board, the respondent has not demonstrated that a reasonable probability that but for the counsel’s alleged errors, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Even if an ineffective assistance claim could be premised on an counsel’s conduct regarding issues which are not directly related to removal proceedings, i.e., the pursuit of a U visa, the respondent has not demonstrated that an authorized official is willing to “certify” the respondent for the issuance of a U visa. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). The former counsel’s assertions indicate that he made efforts to procure a certification from the state attorney’s office in Orange County, Florida and that the office was unresponsive (Tr. at 13, 16). The mere fact that the state attorney’s office has declined to issue a certification to the respondent does not established that the respondent’s counsel was ineffective. The respondent has not established that, even his former counsel’s assistance was free from the alleged defects, there is a reasonable probability that the state attorney’s office would have issued the requisite certification.
 
On appeal, the respondent has presented documents relating to his pursuit of the requisite certification needed for a U visa. The Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Additionally, we decline to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the evidence in the first instance as such evidence has not been shown to affect the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). As discussed above, USCIS has sole jurisdiction to grant a U visa. Moreover, the evidence offered by the respondent does not demonstrate that an authorized official is willing to certify the respondent for U visa status. Accordingly, the evidence offer does not establish that the Immigration Judge’s decision to order the respondent removed to Mexico should be disturbed. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
Matter of M-W-, Respondent
Decided April 9, 2012
**1 *748 Pursuant to the categorical approach, a conviction for the aggravated felony of murder, as defined in section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A) (2006), includes a conviction for murder in violation of a statute requiring a showing that the perpetrator acted with extreme recklessness or a malignant heart, notwithstanding that the requisite mental state may have resulted from voluntary intoxication and that no intent to kill was established.
 
FOR RESPONDENT: George E. Ward, Esquire, Canton, Michigan
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Brian C. Burgtorf, Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: COLE, PAULEY, and WENDTLAND, Board Members.
PAULEY, Board Member:
 
In a decision dated November 23, 2010, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, determined that he was not eligible for any relief from removal, and ordered him removed from the United States. The respondent has appealed from that decision. The principal issue in this case is whether the respondent was properly found removable as having been convicted of the aggravated felony of murder under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A) (2006). To answer this question we must define, at least partially, the scope of the “murder” aggravated felony, in particular where the State statute allows a conviction under some circumstances that do not involve an intent to kill. We conclude that the respondent was convicted of an aggravated felony and will dismiss his appeal.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Poland who was admitted to the United States on July 20, 1982, as a refugee and adjusted his status to that *749 of a lawful permanent resident on August 2, 1983. The respondent was convicted in 2003 based on a no contest plea to two charges of second-degree murder under section 750.317 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The two counts, which contain identical language except for the names of the victims, charged the respondent with killing an elderly couple. Specifically, the amended information charged that the respondent acted “with intent to kill, to do great bodily harm, or to act in wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of said act would cause death or great bodily harm.”
 
The offense appears to have resulted from an early morning traffic incident in which the respondent rear-ended a car, killing the occupants on impact. Other counts to lesser offenses in the information indicate that the respondent was driving under the influence of alcohol.1 Before the Immigration Judge and on appeal, the respondent explained that he pled no contest to the second-degree murder charges in exchange for a reduced sentence. Guilty judgments on two counts of second-degree murder were entered against him on March 18, 2003, and on April 11, 2003, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 8 to 20 years.
 
**2 The respondent was charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, specifically those defined at section 101(a)(43)(A) as “murder, rape, and sexual abuse of a minor” and at section 101(a)(43)(F) as a “crime of violence.” The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s convictions satisfied both aggravated felony definitions. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the determination that a second-degree murder conviction under Michigan law constitutes an aggravated felony conviction under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act *750 because it is, categorically, a conviction for “murder.” Since we find that the respondent is removable as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(A), we need not consider whether the conviction is also for a crime of violence within the meaning of section 101(a)(43)(F).
  
II. STATUTE INVOLVED
 
Michigan, like many other States and the Federal Government, defines murder in two degrees. Section 750.316 of the Michigan Compiled Statutes defines murder in the first degree, in relevant part, as consisting of three types: (1) murder perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or any other willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing; (2) murder committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, various enumerated offenses; and (3) murder of a peace officer or corrections officer who was engaged in the performance of his or her duties.
 
Second-degree murder is defined by section 750.317 of the Michigan Compiled Laws as encompassing “[a]ll other kinds of murder.” See also 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a) (2006). The respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) agree that in this case the murder was not premeditated or intentional,2 and we observe that the doctrine of felony murder is also not applicable in this case.3 Accordingly, we address only whether a certain type of murder conviction, not being of the felony-murder variety and requiring no intent to kill, satisfies the definition of murder for purposes of the aggravated felony definition at section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act.
  
III. ANALYSIS
  
1. Analytical Framework
 
When the Act was amended in 1988 to introduce the term “aggravated felony,” murder was among the first crimes to be listed under the newly *751 created deportable offense covering aliens convicted of an aggravated felony. See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690, § 7342, 102 Stat. 4181, 4469-70 (“ADAA”); Lettman v. Reno, 207 F.3d 1368, 1370 (11th Cir. 2000); Matter of A-A-, 20 I&N Dec. 492, 495 (BIA 1992). However, the term “murder” has been in the Act since 1952 as a bar to good moral character. See Immigration and Nationality Act, Pub. L. No. 82-414, § 101(f)(8), 66 Stat. 163, 172 (1952) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(8) (1958)); see also Taylor v. United States, 231 F.2d 856 (5th Cir. 1956). We are aware of no cases or legislative sources explaining the intended scope of the term “murder” in these statutes. As regards the ADAA, it was introduced and passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate between September and November 1988. During that period, the relevant legislative history does not reflect that the inclusion of “murder” as an aggravated felony in the Act was the subject of any amendment, and there was no extensive reporting or discussion of the term.
 
**3 As the Immigration Judge noted, very little precedent construes the term “murder” in the aggravated felony definition at section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act. Murder is a “generic” offense. See Nijhawan v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. 2294, 2298-2300 (2009) (noting that the term “aggravated felony,” as used in the Act, may refer to so-called “generic” offenses subject to categorical definition or to “circumstance-specific” crimes that refer to the “specific way in which an offender committed the crime on a specific occasion”). Unlike other offenses that have been the subject of analysis by the Federal courts, murder has not diverged significantly from its common-law roots. Cf. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 593 (1990) (ascertaining the elements of the aggravated felony of burglary, which is likewise of common-law origin). Therefore, while we acknowledge the applicability of the type of analysis contemplated by the Supreme Court in Taylor, our task is somewhat simpler, given the existence of (1) a common-law definition of “murder” that remained stable until the adoption of the Model Penal Code, and (2) a Federal statute defining murder, namely, 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a). Although this Federal statute is a significant point of reference in defining the murder aggravated felony, it is not dispositive to our discussion since section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act does not refer to it.4 In invoking the Taylor methodology-- examining, inter alia, common-law and State law to identify the “uniform, categorical definition[]” of an offense--our touchstone is the definition of the crime *752 of “murder” that Congress had in mind when it added that offense to the Act as an aggravated felony in 1988.5 Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. at 581-82, 587-77, 590.
  
2. Common-law and Federal Definitions of “Murder”--Malice
 
“Murder” is defined as the “killing of a human being with malice aforethought.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1043 (8th ed. 2004). This dictionary definition indicates that “state statutes” have adopted a degree structure through which first-degree murder is characterized by conduct that is “willful, deliberate, or premeditated,” such as murder “by poisoning or by lying in wait.” Id. All other types of murder, that is, those not “aggravated by any of the circumstances of first-degree murder,” are generally considered to be second degree, or a lesser degree of murder, which is the type of murder at issue in this case. Id.
 
The Federal murder statute applicable in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a), is substantially the same. As it did in 1988, this statute provides in relevant part:
**4 Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Every murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate any [of various enumerated offenses]; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first degree.
 
Any other murder is murder in the second degree.
 
 
The concept of “malice aforethought,” referenced in both the Federal and dictionary definitions, has been found in the common-law definition of “murder” since at least before the turn of the 16th century. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 692-93 & nn. 13, 15 (1975) (distinguishing homicides *753 committed without “‘malice’ prepensed” as being “manslaughter,” which generally arises out of “sudden provocation”). “Malice aforethought was designated as the element that distinguished” murder from manslaughter, and it is integral to both first- and second-degree murder.6 Id. at 693, 694-96 & n.17; see also Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 484-86 (1895), superseded by statute on other grounds, Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, tit. II, § 402(a), 98 Stat. 1837, 2057; Ornelas v. United States, 236 F.2d 392, 394 (9th Cir. 1956) (construing 18 U.S.C. § 1111(a)). Integral to the concept of “malice” at common law was that the defendant “intended to take life,” or that he had “a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart.” Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. at 485. The concept was also understood at common law to encompass the situation where the defendant intended “to inflict great bodily harm.” Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. at 694.
 
“Malice aforethought” under the Federal murder statute also includes not only the intent to kill but also an intent to do serious bodily injury or an extreme recklessness and wanton disregard for human life (“depraved heart”). United States v. Lemus-Gonzalez, 563 F.3d 88, 92 (5th Cir. 2009); United States v. Williams, 342 F.3d 350, 356 (4th Cir. 2003); United States v. Velazquez, 246 F.3d 204, 214-15 (2d Cir. 2001) (collecting cases finding that intent to do serious bodily harm or extreme reckless disregard for human life can suffice to show malice). “Malice” can be shown through direct or circumstantial evidence and can be inferred by the jury from evidence of the nature of the victim’s injuries or other circumstances of the crime, such as the choice of weapon. United States v. Vallo, 238 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2001) (second-degree murder prosecution); United States v. Free, 841 F.2d 321, 325 (9th Cir. 1988) (first-degree murder prosecution).
 
**5 Contrary to the respondent’s suggestion on appeal, it is clear that at common law and under the Federal murder statute, a murder conviction need not be limited to situations where the defendant acted with the “intent to kill.” This is also true under most, if not all, modern approaches to the term. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that from a moral standpoint, those acting with an “intent to kill” are not necessarily “the most culpable” murderers. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 157 (1987) (stating that “reckless indifference to the value of human life may be every bit as shocking to the moral sense as an ‘intent to kill”’).
  
*754 3. Reckless Conduct Constituting Murder
 
A “depraved heart” murder under Federal law is proven by conduct exhibiting more than gross negligence or ordinary recklessness. United States v. Browner, 889 F.2d 549, 553 (5th Cir. 1989) (explaining that “gross” or “criminal” negligence was far more serious than ordinary negligence, but “still falls short of that most extreme recklessness and wantonness required for ‘depraved heart’ malice”). The standard has been explained as “reckless and wanton conduct . . . which grossly deviated from a reasonable standard of care such that [the defendant] was aware of the serious risk of death.” United States v. Livoti, 22 F. Supp. 2d 235, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (emphasis omitted). A person convicted of depraved heart murder under Federal law disregards a “‘very high degree’ of risk that death or serious bodily injury will result from the defendant’s conduct.” Id. at 245.
 
Since the Federal statute is essentially an adoption of the common law, this was true at common law as well. See United States v. Browner, 889 F.2d at 551; see also Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. at 484-86. Depraved heart killings or murders marked by extremely reckless conduct were precipitated by acts that carried a high likelihood of death or serious bodily injury, but were not aimed at anyone in particular. Darry v. People, 10 N.Y. 120 (N.Y. 1854) (discussing “depraved mind” murder prior to statutory amendment). The classic example of a depraved heart murder is the indiscriminate shooting into a crowd or an occupied building. See Bethea v. Scully, 834 F.2d 257, 260 (2d Cir. 1987) (noting that shooting into a crowd is the “archetype of reckless murder”); see also Tucker v. United States, 151 U.S. 164 (1894).7
 
*755 We note that the use of the term “malice” has, at times, engendered confusion. See State v. Thomas, 769 N.W.2d 357, 364 (Neb. 2009) (discussing the fact that in 1979 the Nebraska legislature eliminated the requirement that a prosecutor must prove malice in a murder prosecution, but that courts continued to read this requirement into the law until 1998); see also People v. Aaron, 299 N.W.2d 304, 319 (Mich. 1980) (acknowledging confusion created by use of the term “malice aforethought”); State v. Standiford, 769 P.2d 254, 258 n.1 (Utah 1988) (noting Model Penal Code commentary on malice). Thus, although it does not alter our analysis, it is relevant to mention that the Model Penal Code, which has heavily influenced State legislatures over the last several decades, de-emphasizes reliance on the term “malice.” See Model Penal Code § 210.2 cmt. 1 (1980) (discussing offense-specific definitions in Part II of the Model Penal Code in 1980).
 
**6 The Model Penal Code defines “murder” as a class of criminal homicide that is committed either (1) purposely or knowingly, or (2) recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.8 Model Penal Code § 210.2(1). The creation of the “reckless/extreme indifference” definition was viewed by the Model Penal Code drafters as providing needed clarification to the term “depraved heart.” See O’Brien v. State, 45 P.3d 225, 231-32 (Wyo. 2002) (citing Model Penal Code § 210.2(1)(b) cmt. 4).9 The degree of recklessness sufficient to support a murder conviction under the Model Penal Code was extreme recklessness beyond the “ordinary recklessness” that would support a manslaughter conviction and was all but indistinguishable from homicides that are committed purposefully or knowingly. Id.
  
*756 4. Defense of Intoxication Negating Mens Rea
 
While the mens rea standard for murder under the common law and Federal law would encompass extremely reckless behavior, generally courts have not endorsed the position advanced by many defendants convicted of murder in the course of driving under the influence, namely, that they were too intoxicated to form the requisite mens rea of recklessness. See United States v. Fleming, 739 F.2d 945, 948 (4th Cir. 1984); Kane v. United States, 399 F.2d 730, 736 (9th Cir. 1968) (convicting of manslaughter despite intoxication). The Model Penal Code also has addressed the viability of a line of defense using evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate the formation of a reckless state of mind and has rejected it. The Code provides that “[w]hen recklessness establishes an element of the offense, if the actor, due to self-induced intoxication, is unaware of a risk of which he would have been aware had he been sober, such awareness is immaterial.” See Model Penal Code § 2.08(2).10
 
The unavailability of the argument that intoxication prevented the formation of a malicious state of mind has been criticized by some commentators. See, e.g., Katherine M. White, Note, Drunk Driving as Second-Degree Murder in Michigan, 41 Wayne L. Rev. 1433 (1995). However, in many jurisdictions, including Michigan,11 the criticism has been to no avail. See 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 9.5(c) (2d ed. 2003).
  
5. Definition of Murder Applicable to Unintentional Killings
 
Therefore on the basic question whether extremely reckless conduct can support a murder conviction under a generic definition, we note the fundamental consistency of the common law, Federal, and Model Penal Code approaches set forth above. That is, “depraved mind murder,” which has been described as “outrageously reckless conduct” committed with “wantonness or total indifference for the value of human life” is substantially similar to murders marked by “extreme indifference to the value of human life.” State v. Reed, 120 P.3d 447, 454-55 (N.M. 2005). Furthermore, evidence of voluntary intoxication does not prevent a conclusion that the defendant had the capacity to act with a depraved heart or extreme indifference to human life.
  
*757 6. Michigan Statute and Jurisprudence on Murder
 
**7 Although the Michigan murder statutes do not contain the term “malice aforethought,” applicable precedent has long dictated that every murder conviction under either section 750.316 or 750.317 of the Michigan Compiled Laws includes, as an element, proof that the defendant acted with “malice aforethought.” People v. Brown, 358 N.W.2d 592, 597 (Mich. Ct. App. 1984) (citing People v. Aaron, 299 N.W.2d 304 (Mich. 1980); People v. Potter, 5 Mich. 1 (1858)). Malice aforethought is as much an element of second-degree murder in Michigan as it is an element of first-degree murder. People v. Roper, 777 N.W.2d 483, 490 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009).12
 
Under Michigan law, malice is defined as “the intent to kill, the intent to cause great bodily harm, or the intent to do an act in wanton and wilful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of such behavior is to cause death or great bodily harm.” Id. at 490 (quoting People v. Goecke, 579 N.W.2d 868, 878 (Mich. 1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted). “The offense of second-degree murder does not require an actual intent to harm or kill, but only the intent to do an act that is in obvious disregard of life-endangering consequences.” Id. (quoting People v. Mayhew, 600 N.W.2d 370, 379 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Proof of malice can be obtained through circumstantial evidence, as well as by direct evidence. People v. Goecke, 579 N.W.2d at 880; see also Dillard v. Prelesnik, 156 F. Supp. 2d 798, 805-06 (E.D. Mich. 2001). The Michigan Supreme Court has recognized that malice can be implied from the circumstances of a crime, stating that if the circumstances “demonstrate an abandoned and malignant heart, [t]his simply means that malice may be implied when the defendant does an act with a high probability that it will result in death and does it with a base antisocial motive and with wanton disregard for human life.” People v. Goecke, 579 N.W.2d at 880 (quoting People v. Fuller, 150 Cal. Rptr. 515, 521 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978)) (internal quotation mark omitted).
 
*758 Establishing malice under Michigan law does not require the showing of a specific intent to kill, yet the courts have stated that proving wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood of death or great bodily harm “differs little in the scale of moral blameworthiness from an actual intent to cause such harm.” Id. at 879. The recklessness required for a murder conviction is of a degree greater than that required for a manslaughter conviction, in that for murder, the prosecutor must show that the defendant performed an act in wanton and willful disregard of the risk that the natural tendency of such act was death or great bodily injury. Id. at 880 (noting also that “malice requires egregious circumstances”). For manslaughter, the defendant is only reckless as to the possibility that death or serious bodily harm may ensue. In Michigan, a defendant’s evidence of voluntary intoxication does not prevent the prosecution from proving that the defendant acted with extreme recklessness. Id. at 878-79 & n.26.13
  
7. Respondent’s Appeal
 
**8 We conclude that under Michigan law, the respondent was found to have killed another human being with malice aforethought, matching the generic elements of the crime of murder. Whether or not he was voluntarily intoxicated at the time has no bearing on the fact that he was determined through a judgment of guilt to have acted in wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of his actions was to cause death or great bodily harm. We are therefore unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that we should not consider his convictions to fall under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act because in Michigan, a prosecutor need not establish that a defendant had an “intent to kill.” While this is true, the operative mens rea in both the generic definition of murder and under Michigan law is substantially the same-- malice aforethought or a minimum of extreme recklessness as to the serious risk or natural consequence of death or serious bodily injury as a result of the defendant’s actions.
 
Moreover, in both the generic definition and under Michigan law, malice can be shown by proving a reckless and wanton disregard for human life or the intent to do great bodily harm. The Michigan Supreme Court has long *759 recognized that “if a mortal blow was malicious, although not given with intent to kill, or if death ensued from an act accompanying an unlawful collateral act, or under circumstances which showed general malice, such as a reckless disregard of the safety or lives of others, the killing would be murder.” People v. Potter, 5 Mich. at 4 (explaining that the purpose behind enactment of the statute specifying degrees of murder was to “separate,” for purposes of punishment, first-degree murder offenses); accord People v. Garcia, 247 N.W.2d 547 (Mich. 1976), abrogated on other grounds, Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) (regarding ineffective assistance of counsel). While the intent to kill is an element of first-degree premeditated murder in Michigan, it is not an element of the offense of second-degree murder, of which the respondent was convicted. People v. Garcia, 247 N. W.2d at 550 (stating that “first degree murder . . . requir[es] an intention to take life”). Even absent a requirement that a prosecutor must prove an intent to kill, a conviction for second-degree murder under section 750.317 of the Michigan statutes is nonetheless categorically one for “murder” as defined in section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, because it conforms to the generic definition of that term.
 
We are also unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge’s decision to sustain the charge of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act violates the Supreme Court’s decision in Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1 (2004). As to the question whether a second-degree murder conviction in Michigan constitutes an aggravated felony conviction under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, the Leocal decision has no impact. Indeed, one of the reasons for having separate aggravated felony branches covering murder and crimes of violence is that murder may be committed through nonviolent means. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 282 n.27 (1980) ( “Caesar’s death at the hands of Brutus and his fellow conspirators was undoubtedly violent; the death of Hamlet’s father at the hands of his brother, Claudius, by poison, was not.”). Furthermore, the respondent’s argument would appear to exclude felony murder provisions, which were in 1988, and currently are, part and parcel of the Federal approach, as well as a great majority of State murder statutes. We therefore reject the respondent’s argument since it appears to confuse the requirements for finding an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act with Leocal’s analysis of crimes of violence under section 101(a)(43)(F).14
 
**9 *760 In light of the foregoing and the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 8 to 20 years for the two second-degree murder convictions, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony and a particularly serious crime. He is therefore ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the Act. Sections 208(b)(2)(B)(i), 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii) (2006).
 
The respondent’s remaining application for relief is for deferral of removal to Poland under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46. 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988). We concur with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent failed to offer sufficient evidence to show that he faces a clear probability of torture at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, government officials or persons acting in an official capacity.15 A public official’s acquiescence to torture “requires that the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(7) (2011). The respondent has not shown that anyone in the Polish Government would consent or acquiesce (including the concept of willful blindness) to his torture, and he is therefore not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Both parties make arguments about the extent to which the respondent’s blood alcohol level was over the legal limit, but we find it unnecessary to address these arguments in detail. We note that the information reflects that the respondent was also charged under section 257.625(4) of the Michigan Compiled Laws, which punishes homicides that are caused by persons driving under the influence of alcohol. Such statutes are commonly employed by States to cover traffic accidents related to “drunk driving.” But a more serious charge may also be levied, up to and including second-degree murder. See Delgado v. Holder, 648 F.3d 1095, 1113 n.11 (9th Cir. 2011) (Reinhardt, J., concurring in part) (citing People v. Watson, 637 P.2d 279, 286 (Cal. 1981) (rejecting the argument that a vehicular homicide statute preempted a general murder statute, and finding that evidence that the defendant was legally intoxicated, drove at excessive speeds, ran a red light, and struck and killed an occupant in another vehicle was sufficient to show that he acted “wantonly and with a conscious disregard for human life”)). We have no authority to go behind a conviction with regard to its validity under State law or to assess whether the facts met the State’s discretionary criteria for pursuing murder charges, rather than some lesser charge, such as manslaughter.

2

Pursuant to our request, the respondent and the DHS each submitted a supplemental brief addressing the proper approach to be taken in construing the meaning of the term “murder” as used in section 101(a)(43)(A), and the effect, if any, of evidence of voluntary intoxication on a defendant’s mens rea.

3

Killings committed in the course of or in flight from certain felonies are considered “murder” by statute and under the common law in the majority of United States jurisdictions. See Tom Stacy, Changing Paradigms in the Law of Homicide, 62 Ohio St. L.J. 1007, 1012 n.20 (2001); see also Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982). Although we have no cause to address this rule, we acknowledge that it is not without controversy.

4

Other aggravated felony provisions expressly refer to offenses “described in” certain enumerated Federal statutes. See, e.g., sections 101(a)(43)(E), (H), (I), (J), (L), (M)(ii), (N), (O), (P) of the Act.

5

We have nevertheless stated that in formulating the “generic” definition of a term appearing in the Act’s list of “aggravated felonies,” we should rely to a significant degree on the Federal definition of an offense, where available, because “removal proceedings are a function of Federal law.” Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 22 I&N Dec. 991, 994-95 (BIA 1999). We also note that Congress is presumed to have been familiar with the Federal definition of murder when it enacted the ADAA. See Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1, 2 (2006) (assuming that, when passing a statute, “Congress was familiar with the long-established common-law rule”); Matter of Velazquez-Herrera, 24 I&N Dec. 503, 509-10, 515 (BIA 2008) (citing Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 407-08 (1991) (stating that the undefined term “supervised release” used in the 1986 amendments should be defined with reference to the well-established meaning of that term set forth in earlier statutes bearing on similar subject matter)).

6

The presence of malice indicated the absence of justification for the homicide in the form of “heat of passion” or “sudden provocation.” Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 213 (1977).

7

Examples of States that, in 1988, adhered to an essentially common-law, malice-based definition of murder consistent with the Federal statute are Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. See, e.g., State v. Walton, 650 P.2d 1264, 1272-73 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1982) (intentionally causing death, knowingly acting to cause great bodily injury resulting in death, or engaging in reckless conduct showing extreme indifference to human life); People v. Murray, 275 Cal. Rptr. 498 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990); Comber v. United States, 584 A.2d 26 (D.C. 1990); State v. Smith, 242 N.W.2d 320 (Iowa 1976); State v. McCown, 957 P.2d 401 (Kan. 1998); Gladden v. State, 330 A.2d 176 (Md. 1974); Commonwealth v. Sowell, 494 N.E.2d 1359 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986); State v. Thomas, 769 N.W.2d 357, 364 (Neb. 2009) (discussing developments in Nebraska law regarding malice dating back to 1979); Keys v. State, 766 P.2d 270 (Nev. 1988); State v. List, 636 A.2d 1103 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 1990); State v. Wilkerson, 247 S.E.2d 905 (N.C. 1978); Commonwealth v. Prosdocimo, 578 A.2d 1273 (Pa. 1990); State v. Iovino, 554 A.2d 1037 (R.I. 1989); State v. Cravens, 764 S.W.2d 754 (Tenn. 1989); State v. Standiford, 769 P.2d 254 (Utah 1988) (intentionally or knowingly causing death, intentionally causing great bodily injury, depraved indifference); Thomas v. Commonwealth, 41 S.E.2d 476 (Va. 1947); State v. Starkey, 244 S.E.2d 219 (W. Va. 1978), overruled on other grounds by State v. Guthrie, 461 S.E.2d 163 (W. Va. 1995).

8

Examples of States that, as of 1988, adopted the above Model Penal Code definitions to a significant degree are Florida, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin. See Hooker v. State, 497 So.2d 982 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986); State v. Dufield, 549 A.2d 1205 (N.H. 1988); State v. Tyerla, 424 N.W.2d 908 (S.D. 1988); State v. Dunbar, 817 P.2d 1360 (Wash. 1991); State v. Spears, 433 N.W.2d 595 (Wis. Ct. App. 1988).

9

The drafters of the Model Penal Code elected not to include “intent to cause grievous bodily harm” in their description of the mens rea for murder. See State v. Russell, 733 P.2d 162, 173 (Utah 1987) (Stewart, J., concurring) (citing Model Penal Code § 210.2 cmt. 5 at 28-29 (1980)).

10

Several States have stand-alone statutes barring consideration of voluntary intoxication in the determination of mens rea. See Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, 48-49 (1996).

11

See infra note 13.

12

Nothing in the Michigan legislative history indicates that its definition of murder has substantially changed since 1988. In fact, the definition appears to have remained fairly constant over at least the last 150 years. See People v. Potter, 5 Mich. at 4 (“Murder is where a person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being, in the peace of the state, with malice prepense or aforethought, either express or implied.”). Jury instructions were amended in or about 1983, however, to de-emphasize use of the word “malice” and to use instead the statutory mens rea terms: intent to kill, to cause great bodily harm, or to do an act in wanton and willful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of such behavior is to cause death or great bodily harm. People v. Woods, 331 N.W.2d 707, 727 (Mich. 1983).

13

The Michigan Supreme Court noted that this was true regardless of whether it treated the wanton and willful disregard standard as an objective one (as the prosecution urged in that case) or as a subjective one. People v. Goecke, 579 N.W.2d at 878-79 & n.26. We note that the case did not turn on the question whether the standard is subjectively or objectively derived and that in addressing it, the court appeared mainly concerned with establishing the unavailability of an intoxication-related defense to a charge of second-degree murder that arose out of grossly reckless conduct.

14

We also cannot credit the respondent’s argument that attacks the validity of his convictions on the basis of an asserted violation of the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). Any challenge to the convictions that rests on ineffective assistance of counsel must be brought to the State of Michigan in an appropriate motion seeking to overturn or vacate the convictions based on constitutional defects. We are unable to go beyond the convictions to assess their validity. See Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294, 301 (BIA 1991).

15

We note that the respondent does not specifically address this issue in his brief on appeal.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margot Merrill-Johnson
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on March 25, 2002, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 17, 1999, decision ordering him removed from the United States to Nigeria. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen proceedings on January 13, 2012. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he received from the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Court and this Board. Specifically, the respondent argues, inter alia, that prior counsel (1) did not timely notify the respondent of the Board’s 2002 decision, (2) did not timely file an appeal to the Circuit Court, and (3) did not challenge the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as an aggravated felon.1
 
The respondent has provided no evidence in support of these allegations and claims, except for his own declaration, which neither identifies his prior counsel nor sets forth any agreement between himself and prior counsel. Thus, notwithstanding the respondent’s declaration, he has not complied with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) in making claims against his former counsel. Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made.
 
While the respondent argues that his unidentified prior attorney failed to promptly notify him of the issuance of our decision or appeal its outcome, he has filed insufficient evidence for us to ascertain how this delay indicates that he suffered any prejudice on account of such allegations. See id. Lastly, the respondent has failed to show due diligence in making such claims against prior counsel, inasmuch as he has filed this motion over nearly 13 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and nearly a decade after our decision in the case. See id; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). As such, we do not find that equitable tolling is warranted, nor do we find that the respondent warrants reopening under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See generally Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, we will deny the respondent’s motion as untimely.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent’s appellate brief contained a legal argument disputing the respondent’s removability as an aggravated felon, and we addressed this issue in our 2002 decision (Bd. Dec. at 1-2). In our decision, we noted that the aggravated felony charges against the respondent had not been sustained by the Immigration Judge, and the DHS had not appealed from the Immigration Judge’s rulings in this regard.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Abigail D. Molina, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nicole M. Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed in absentia on March 17, 2011. On April 4, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on April 21, 2011. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that she had received proper notice for her March 17, 2011, hearing. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
Upon review, we find that in view of the above and in light of the totality of circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s former counsel conceded that he provided ineffective assistance by failing to appear at the March 17, 2011, hearing, we will allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008).
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph O. Reosti, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 3, 2011, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the scheduled hearing on May 27, 2010. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal the respondent asserts that documents attached to his appellate brief establish that the respondent’s former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to timely file the motion to reopen, and by conceding the charge of removability in a motion to change venue. The respondent contends that he established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear because the day prior to his scheduled hearing, his former spouse unexpectedly left the respondent’s two biological children and his stepchild with him and abandoned them.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on May 27, 2010. The respondent’s motion to reopen was due on November 23, 2010, but it was not filed until November 29, 2010. Therefore, the respondent failed to file his motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
Furthermore, the 180-day filing deadline for filing a motion to rescind an in absentia order based on exceptional circumstances is not subject to equitable tolling or other exceptions, even in the case of ineffective assistance of counsel or where the alien acts blamelessly. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Abdi v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that petitioner’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, filed after the 90-day deadline in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), could not be equitably tolled).
 
The respondent also raised the issue of lack of proper notice in the notice to appeal. He contends that notice was improper because the respondent’s former attorney had withdrawn based upon lack of payment, and notice was mailed after his attorney’s withdrawal. However, the respondent has not addressed this issue in his appellate brief, nor has he submitted any evidence to support his assertion of lack of proper notice. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel W. Diaz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2011, decision denying his motion to reconsider. The respondent sought reconsideration of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We review findings of fact by the Immigration Judge for clear error, while all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(ii). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that removal proceedings were instituted pursuant to a Notice to Appear dated February 28, 2000, and the respondent was granted voluntary departure by an Immigration Judge on March 15, 2002. On October 12, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the earlier proceedings. The respondent asserts that his then counsel provided ineffective assistance in not advising him to pursue a U visa based upon his cooperation with police following a 1996 or 1997 criminal incident. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 214.14 (discussing requirements for a U visa). On October 20, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, in part, on the basis that the respondent did not display due diligence in seeking the reopening of proceedings. On November 3, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on November 22, 2011. The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reconsider.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent acknowledges that his motion to reopen, filed over 9 years after he was granted voluntary departure, was untimely, but argues that this period should be tolled due to the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zhao v. I.N.S., 452 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that the time limit for a motion to reopen may be equitably tolled based on ineffective assistance of counsel in some cases). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not display due diligence in discovering the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the years following the grant of voluntary departure. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that an alien seeking equitable tolling must demonstrate due diligence in both discovering and pursuing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding no abuse of discretion in Board’s determination that alien did not display due diligence in pursuing a claim). We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2011, decision contains an error of fact or law such that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) (stating the requirements for a motion to reconsider). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James J. Orlow, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Paulette R. Taylor
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 24, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen. The respondent filed her second motion to reopen on November 23, 2011, which the Department of Homeland Security opposes. She submitted supplemental documentation on February 13, 2012. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is both time and number-barred as it is her second such motion, and was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s June 10, 2010, final administrative decision. Sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(c). The respondent seeks reopening as she avers that former counsel, Ms. Clarke, provided her with ineffective assistance. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She also asks that proceedings be reopened sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
While the respondent has largely complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, she did not demonstrate that she was prejudiced by Ms. Clarke’s actions. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra at 1274 (holding that, “in addition to substantial, if not exact, compliance with ... Lozada, a petitioner ... must also show prejudice” in order to establish the ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of removal proceedings). “Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” Id.
 
One of the reasons why the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s September 28, 2010, motion to reopen was that she failed to submit evidence regarding the bona fides of her marriage. The respondent has not shown that such evidence was available and could have been presented at that time. With her current motion the respondent submitted a sworn affidavit reporting that she met her husband in November of 2009, and that they were married on August 29, 2010. She provides no details regarding their courtship or relationship. However, the record reflects that the respondent sought a continuance on January 27, 2010, because she was then pregnant, and had moved to New York “where the father of her baby resides.” She stated that he was “supporting her emotionally and financially.” The motion for the continuance makes no mention of the respondent’s current husband, nor has he been identified as the father of the respondent’s baby. There is also no indication that the respondent’s husband ever resided in New York. Rather, it appears that he has always resided in Pennsylvania. Submissions from the respondent and her husband since the motion for a continuance do not mention either the baby, or the identity of the baby’s father.
 
*2 The respondent’s husband offered a statement dated December 9, 2010, more than a year after they reportedly met and more than three months after their marriage, indicating that they could not provide some documents in support of their marriage “due to incidents not cleared up yet” (Motion, Tab D). The evidence that was submitted included a November 2, 2010, life insurance policy naming the respondent as one of the beneficiaries; a December 9, 2010, form from a utility company indicating that the respondent had applied for service at a Pennsylvania address; a June 15, 2010, receipt for wedding rings from a Pennsylvania store; and photocopies of three wedding cards and a picture of the married couple (Motion, Tabs E-G).
 
As noted, the Immigration Judge denied reopening in part because of the respondent’s failure to submit evidence that her marriage was bona fide. With the 2010 motion, Ms. Clarke submitted a statement from the respondent, evidence that her husband had filed a visa petition on her behalf, and a copy of the marriage certificate. The only other evidence that apparently was available and could have been submitted in conjunction with the motion filed by Ms. Clarke would have been a letter from the respondent’s husband, and the photocopies of the cards and picture of the couple. There is no evidence that her husband’s letter would have been substantially different from the one submitted by the respondent. We find that, even if such evidence had been submitted, it would have been insufficient to establish the bona fides of the marital relationship. Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). As such, the respondent has not demonstrated that Ms. Clarke’s performance was so inadequate that there was a reasonable possibility that, but for her failure to submit the available evidence, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011). Therefore, reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
Similarly, we decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. The fact that the visa petition was approved on January 26, 2012, more than a year after the Immigration Judge denied her motion to reopen and more than three months after the Board upheld that decision, does not constitute an exceptional circumstance supporting reopening. Rather, the approval of a visa petition months after a respondent has been ordered removed is a not uncommon, rather than exceptional, circumstance. As such, we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the Board’s sua sponte authority is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to circumvent the time limits where enforcing them might cause hardship); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*3 As we find that reopening is not warranted, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: NORIKO KANAI A.K.A. NORIKO KANAI-POARCH
File: AXXX XX3 177 - Omaha, Nebraska

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victor T. Nevada, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Clete P. Samson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a 39-year-old married female native and citizen of Japan, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s written decision dated November 11, 2010, which denied her motion to reopen her in absentia removal order. The respondent also filed an “amended” motion, and a motion to reconsider, which we will construe as constituting motions to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response on appeal. The motions will be denied. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2011). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgement and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because she did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993).
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on September 28, 2004, when the respondent failed to appear, the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, determined that she had abandoned all potential applications for relief, and ordered her removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.
 
In her motion to reopen filed on October 12, 2010, which was 6 years after she had been ordered removed, she alleged, through counsel Jacob Chang, that she had not received notice of her September 28, 2004, hearing.1 She also alleged that she had been instructed by her previous immigration attorney “of record” that it was not necessary for her to appear at the hearing.
 
*2 In a written decision issued on November 11, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the motion because the notice of her hearing had been mailed to the respondent’s last known address as indicated in the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213) in the record (Exh. 3). In addition, he noted that the respondent was not represented by counsel at the time the in absentia order was entered and therefore no attorney of record existed. Insofar as she had alleged that a prior attorney had committed ineffective assistance, the Immigration Judge found that the motion did not comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) because it did not reflect that she had filed a bar complaint. Finally, he noted that the motion did not contain an affidavit from the respondent.
 
On November 8, 2010, the respondent, through new attorneys, Maile M. Hirota and Victor T. Nevada, filed an “amended” motion to reopen with the Omaha Immigration Court.2 However, it was not received by the Chicago Immigration Court, where the Immigration Judge was located, until November 16, 2010, after he had issued his decision on the first motion. On November 29, 2010, she filed a motion to reconsider, which was not addressed by the Immigration Judge before the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board on December 7, 2010. Therefore, we will construe both motions as constituting motions to remand before the Board.
 
In the November 8, 2010, motion, the respondent claimed that her original motion contained “material inaccuracies and omissions” because she had, in fact, received notice of the September 28, 2004, hearing. She therefore withdrew her claim of lack of notice. Instead, she maintained that she should be eligible for equitable tolling based on the alleged ineffective assistance of an attorney (Thomas Lee) she and her husband had retained to assist them in several matters, including her immigration case, and that his ineffective assistance constituted exceptional circumstances. The respondent’s November 29, 2010, motion requested that the Immigration Judge vacate his November 11, 2010, decision because her request to substitute counsel had been incorrectly rejected based on the absence of a pending case.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that it was error for the Immigration Judge to deny her motion to reopen without having reviewed her “amended” motion to reopen, and that she has established exceptional circumstances and ineffective assistance of counsel to merit reopening of her in absentia removal order.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s October 12, 2010 motion. The Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent had received notice of the September 28, 2004, hearing and the respondent conceded that she received notice in her November 8, 2010, motion. In addition, the motion did not contain an affidavit as required, and it also did not establish any exceptional circumstances to excuse her failure to appear. Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996); Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(l).
 
*3 Furthermore, the respondent has not set forth any valid reason to excuse her failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, when she filed her October 12, 2010, motion to reopen she should have also made her ineffective assistance claim. See Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216 (BIA 1990) (arguments for consideration should be presented at one time, and not in “piecemeal fashion”).
 
We will deny the respondent’s November 8, 2010, motion because the respondent has not satisfied all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, even at this time, because she has not provided a copy of the bar complaint she allegedly filed against Mr. Lee, and only has provided a copy of the bar complaint her husband filed against him for his representation in non-immigration matters. She also has not provided a copy of Mr. Lee’s response, if any, to her bar complaint, nor has she alleged that she has filed a bar complaint against Mr. Chang, who filed the first motion to reopen which contained factual inaccuracies.
 
To the extent that the respondent claimed that she was not aware of the allegations made by Mr. Chang in her October 12, 2010, motion, aliens “are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, including admissions made by them, absent egregious circumstances.” Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, her contention that the Immigration Judge erred by issuing his decision without reviewing her November 8, 2010, motion is without merit because the Immigration Judge was not aware that she submitted a subsequent motion.
 
We also will deny the respondent’s November 29, 2010, motion regarding the rejection of her motion to substitute counsel by the Omaha Immigration Court administrative staff. The rejection represents at most a harmless clerical error, and the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice because her new attorneys later filed two motions which were accepted. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s November 8, and November 29, 2010, motions to remand are denied.

Although Mr. Chang signed the motion on August 13, 2010, and attached a receipt from the Los Angeles, California DHS office which reflected that he paid the $ 110 filing fee on August 13, 2010, it is date stamped by the Omaha Immigration Court as having been received on October 12, 2010.

2

On November 3, 2010, the respondent filed a motion for substitution of counsel to replace Mr. Chang with Maile M. Hirota and Victor T. Nevada. However, the Omaha Immigration Court administrative staff sent a preprinted form notice on November 4, 2010, to Mr. Chang which erroneously rejected the filing because the Immigration Court records did not indicate that the respondent’s case was pending before the Immigration Court.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The appeal is dismissed. The Immigration Judge’s order, dated July 8, 2010, reflects that the respondent had waived appeal, and the transcript of proceedings also indicates that the respondent, through his attorney, waived appeal (Tr. at 12). On July 22, 2010, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(2)(G), 1003.39. The respondent makes no claim that the appeal waiver was invalid.
 
To the extent that the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the requirements for making such a claim, as described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the Lozada requirements). These requirements include filing an affidavit describing the scope of the representation agreement, notifying the prior attorney of the allegations, and lodging a complaint against the attorney with the proper disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.1
 
Therefore, we find that this case is not properly before us, and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied, the appeal is dismissed, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without any further Board action.

The respondent also claims that the lack of translation during the hearing left him “confused”; however, he was represented by counsel. Also, as a longtime resident of the United States who wrote his Notice of Appeal and extension request in English, there is no evidence that he was hampered in understanding the proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark J. Falco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah B. Campbell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 18, 2001, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order that was entered on October 4, 2000. On May 20, 2011, the respondent filed a new motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal based on a deficiency with the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) and ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is properly filed with the Board, since we entered the last order in these proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent urges that the NTA should be deemed invalid because it did not specify the date and time of her initial hearing (Motion at 4). We note that the NTA indicates both the date and time are “to be determined” (Exh. 1). Pursuant to the applicable regulation, the date and time of an initial removal hearing shall be provided in the NTA “where practicable,” and if the date and time are not set when the NTA is issued, the Immigration Court shall be responsible for scheduling the hearing and providing notice regarding the date, place, and time of the initial hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b). Accordingly, here, in compliance with these regulations and the Act the Immigration Court sent the respondent’s initial notice of hearing to the address of the detention center where she was currently residing.1 See section 239(a)(2)(A), (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2)(A), (c) (permitting service by mail of the time and place of any hearing before the Immigration Court and finding attempted service at the alien’s last address provided in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act to be sufficient).
 
In the alternative, the respondent urges that the numerical limitations on motions to reopen and rescind an in absentia order should be equitably tolled because she is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) & (c)(7)(A) (setting forth time and number limits on motions to reopen and rescind in absentia orders of removal); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (same); see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 159 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim may warrant equitable tolling of both the time and number limits).
 
*2 First, the respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada2 procedural requirements. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must comply with the Lozada requirements). Second, the respondent has not demonstrated that she acted with due diligence in pursuing her claim prior to filing the instant motion on May 20, 2011, almost 10 years after the Board’s prior decision. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-32 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that, in order to warrant equitable tolling, an alien is required to demonstrate “due diligence” in pursuing his claims during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed”). Third, the respondent has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her prior counsels actions or inactions. See Jiang v. Mukasey, supra, at 270 (stating that to succeed on a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance an applicant must show, inter alia, “that the applicant was prejudiced by his counsel’s performance.”). Here, the respondent seeks to apply for political asylum. However, she has not articulated a basis for her claim nor has she submitted an asylum application or any evidence to establish her prima facie eligibility for relief. Thus, the motion to reopen is untimely, and the respondent has not shown due diligence or prejudice to warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Finally, although not explicitly requested, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent was initially placed in removal proceedings with the Immigration Court in Miami, Florida. She was then released from former INS custody and filed a motion to change venue to the Immigration Court in New York, New York (see I.J. Decision dated October 4, 2000; Exh. 2).

Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), requires a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim be accompanied by: “(1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the alien notified former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel’s conduct and, if a complaint was not filed, an explanation for not doing so.”).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 This case was last before us on November 29, 2011, at which time we denied the respondent’s timely motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent has now filed another motion on January 11, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent has submitted no evidence in support of his motion to reopen; rather, he has filed a brief stating, inter alia, that he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings, and that he still fears returning to Jamaica. Cast as a motion to reconsider, we would find the respondent’s motion untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Cast as a motion to reopen, the motion would be number-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Moreover, such a motion to reopen “shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material” and shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered “was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Inasmuch as the respondent has filed no evidence in support of his motion, we do not find that he has met the regulatory requirements necessary for a motion of this sort. Id. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriel Ogueri, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victor P. Lehman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 5, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The Notice to Appear alleges that, on April 24, 2008, the respondent was convicted of Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance, in violation of Texas law. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings (Exh. 2). See section 240(c)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved (I.J. at 2-3). We do not find this factual finding to be clearly erroneous.
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony relating to illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (Exh. 1). The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged (I.J. at 2-3). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s conviction is an aggravated felony and that there is clear and convincing evidence of removability. See section 240(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10.
 
The respondent requested a continuance to collaterally attack the conviction pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010),1 but the Immigration Judge denied that request (Tr. at 27-30; I.J. at 3). The respondent requested no other relief, and the Immigration Judge concluded he was ineligible for relief (Tr. at 27-30; I.J. at 3).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).2 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). The conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Abreu, supra. See also Cabrai v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886 (5th Cir. 2011); Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 216-17 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1985).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in his deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates his right to counsel.

2

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarosh Nawaz Wahla
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
*1 In a decision dated November 29, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure and ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent filed a timely appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge weighed the positive and negative equities. See Matter of Lemhammad, 20 I&N Dec. 316 (BIA 1991). We have considered the respondent’s arguments and find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact. Upon de novo review of whether those facts support the conclusion that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof to establish that he merits relief as a matter of discretion, we reach the same conclusion as the Immigration Judge. The respondent essentially argues on appeal that the two controlled substances crimes discussed by the Immigration Judge, as well as a misdemeanor driving under the influence offense that the Immigration Judge did not discuss, are insufficient for a negative finding. The respondent also discusses the length of time he has spent in the United States and the economic difficulties he would face in Mexico. While we acknowledge that the respondent has presented some positive equities, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent does not merit a grant of voluntary departure.
 
The respondent states that the Immigration Judge should have continued the case until his attorney made an appearance, but he does not state that he requested a continuance, and does not describe what, if any, efforts he made to have an attorney represent him. The transcript reflects that the respondent was able to communicate with the Immigration Judge and there was no apparent reason to continue the case based on the respondent’s inability to proceed pro se. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (continuance may be granted for good cause shown). Thus, contrary to the respondent’s appellate claims regarding due process and the right to counsel, we find no constitutional violation. To the extent that the respondent’s appellate argument may be construed as a complaint about the performance of his counsel, he has not filed a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and on the record before us we see no justification for sustaining the appeal on this basis. See, e.g. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se1
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia M. Medeiros
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In an oral decision dated November 14, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance; found him removable; determined that he did not demonstrate eligibility for any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Trinidad and Tobago.2 The respondent appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was found removable as charged, as in the United States in violation of law pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Upon our de novo review, we find correct the Immigration Judge’s conclusions concerning the respondent’s removability and ineligibility for removal relief.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him an additional continuance of his removal hearings to await the adjudication by the criminal court of pending charges for criminal possession of stolen property and assault. At his removal hearings, the respondent indicated that, if the criminal charges were dismissed and he were released from custody, he would marry his United States citizen fiancee, who would file an immediate relative visa petition on his behalf. In addition, his lawful permanent resident mother had filed a second preference visa petition for him on November 4, 2011. If a visa petition for him were approved, he would seek adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. He stated that he was not seeking any other relief from removal. See Tr. at 4. He was represented by immigration counsel throughout his hearings. With his appeal, he has provided documentation from the criminal court reflecting that the assault charge was dismissed without prejudice on December 20, 2011, and that the criminal possession of stolen property charge is to be dismissed and sealed on March 1, 2012.
 
The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1997); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. In this case, the Immigration Judge afforded the respondent two previous continuances, from September 27, 2011, until October 31, 2011; and from October 31, 2011, until November 14, 2011. As of the November 2011 final hearing, no visa petition had been approved for the respondent. The preference petition filed for him by his mother in November 2011 remained pending. He and his citizen fiancee had not married and, consequently, she had not even filed a spousal petition for him. In the absence of an approved visa petition, the respondent did not demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, consistent with the Immigration Judge’s determinations.3 Given the lack of an approved visa petition, the respondent is ineligible for adjustment of status, even if both of his criminal charges have been dismissed by the criminal court. Cf. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (holding that, if the respondent presents a prima facie approvable visa petition and an adjustment application, a rebuttable presumption arises that the continuance should be granted and that, in considering a continuance request, four factors to be evaluated are: 1) the position of the DHS regarding the continuance request; 2) whether the visa petition is prima facie approvable; 3) whether the respondent is statutorily eligible for the requested relief; and 4) whether discretion should be exercised in the respondent’s favor). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination not to allow a third continuance.
 
*2 Next, the respondent contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him at his removal hearings. However, the respondent has failed to offer any evidence that substantially complies with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he further has failed to demonstrate that he suffered the requisite prejudice from counsel’s alleged action or inaction such that a remand for consideration of his claim would be warranted, based on his cursory and unsupported appellate allegations. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment or removal relief, either before the Immigration Judge or on appeal. To the extent that the respondent contends that his removal proceedings were unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in handling his hearings, under the circumstances of this case. We also find that he has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would amount to a due process violation. See Romanishyn v. Attorney General of U.S., 455 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 2006).
 
Finally, the respondent has requested a remand. See Br. at 5. We do not find that a remand is warranted for any reason in this case, and we deny the remand request.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.4

1

The record contains documentation from attorney Barry Schneps verifying that he was released from representation by the respondent. Thus, the respondent is pro se.

2

The proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed in Newark, New Jersey through video conference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii).

3

The Immigration Judge also correctly observed that, even if the preference visa petition filed by his mother in November 2011 were to be approved, the respondent still could not demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, as the priority date is not current for such visa petition. See Department of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. IX, No. 42 (March 2012) (reflecting relevant current priority dates for family second preference petitions of November 15, 2003, and earlier). Thus, he would not have an immigrant visa immediately available to him, as required by section 245(a)(3) of the Act.

4

We note that the transcript contains numerous “indiscernibles.” However, we have been able to fully review the record, and neither party has raised the issue.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Julie R. Sparks, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
W.P. Hollerich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on February 4, 2009, after failing to appear at a hearing. He was thereafter removed from this country, returned, and filed a motion to reopen on November 14, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied it on November 21, 2011, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent does not argue in his Notice of Appeal that his failure to appear at his hearing was caused by either “exceptional circumstances” or lack of notice. He states therein that he was eligible to apply for a U visa at the time of his hearing, and he was denied the opportunity.
 
The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) provides that “except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed nearly 2 years after the Immigration Judge ordered his removal from the United States. It is therefore untimely.
 
In addition, in Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Board held that it lacked authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) to reopen removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings-whether on motion of an alien or sua sponte-if the alien has departed the United States after those administrative proceedings have been completed. The only exceptions involve timely motions to reopen a removal order or alleging lack of notice as the reason for a failure to appear. See Martinez Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010); Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009). Neither situation is applicable herein.
 
*2 We further would not reopen these proceedings sua sponte even if we had such authority. We do not find that the respondent established the existence of an exceptional situation to warrant doing so. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We also note no evidence that the respondent was denied due process by the Immigration Judge presiding at his hearing or satisfied any of the procedural requirements for establishing that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Bongseob Moon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lincoln Jalelian
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of South Korea, have appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 29, 2009. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act maybe available to certain aliens in deportation proceedings. However, the respondents here are in removal proceedings. Removal proceedings replaced deportation proceedings in immigration cases commencing on or after April 1, 1997. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (enacted Sept. 30, 1996) (IIRIRA). In addition, §§ 304(a)(3) and 308(a)(7) of the IIRIRA, 110 Stat. at 3009-594, 3009-615, specifically repealed section 244(a) of the Act in all cases commencing on or after April 1, 1997, and provided a new form of relief - cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) - for aliens in removal proceedings. The Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was served on the respondents on March 5, 2009, and filed with the Immigration Court on March 13, 2009. Thus, the respondents cannot apply for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act because that provision no longer existed for aliens, such as the respondents, who are in removal proceedings. See Arenas-Yepes v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 111, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that because petitioner’s proceedings commenced after the enactment of IIRIRA, alien was statutorily ineligible for suspension of deportation). Moreover, they are statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act because they have not shown that they have a qualifying family member (Tr. at 12-14). See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. Nor did they seek this form of relief. See Pleadings, dated September 23, 2009. Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds for reopening. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998).
 
The respondents on appeal maintain that the Immigration Judge failed to consider that they “were defrauded by an immigration broker.” Notice of Appeal Addendum. The record does not reveal that this issue was raised before the Immigration Judge. In addition, we note that they have not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005); Matter of Asaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondents failed to show any due process denial because they were not provided the list of free legal services with the Notice to Appear (I.J. at 1-3). The record reflects that the list was provided to the respondents at their first hearing on April 14, 2009 (Tr. at 3). Moreover, they have not established any prejudice, given that they were provided two continuances to obtain counsel (Tr. at 4, 7) and had representation at their final hearing of September 29, 2009 (Tr. at 9). See Monter v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 546 (2d Cir. 2005)(to demonstrate “prejudice,” of kind required to entitle alien to remand based on immigration judge’s erroneous decision of motion for change of venue, alien must show that denial of venue change affected either the outcome or overall fairness of proceeding).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Xin Miao, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph B. La Rocca
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 17, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and requests that the filing deadline for his motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances be equitably tolled. The respondent seeks reopening in order to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
As an initial matter, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen on the basis of exceptional circumstances is untimely, inasmuch as it was not filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s August 27, 1999, in absentia order of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). To the extent that the respondent requests equitable tolling of the filing deadline, we note that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has not held in a published decision that filing deadlines before this Board may be equitably tolled. Indeed, in Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008), the court found that a request for equitable tolling was in effect a request that the Board exercise sua sponte authority over an untimely motion under at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and that the court lacks jurisdiction to review a decision by the Board not to exercise this authority.
 
In this matter, the Board declines to exercise its sua sponte authority over the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent claims that he did not appear for his August 27, 1999, hearing at the instructions of former counsel, who informed the respondent that he would file a motion for a change of venue and that the respondent need not appear for his hearing. However, despite not receiving any further updates from his counsel and learning of his counsel’s disbarment in 2002, the respondent did not inquire as to the status of his case until he retained current counsel in 2010 (R’s affidavit at 2). As a result, we find that the respondent did not act with due diligence in seeking reopening of his removal proceedings.1 Furthermore, the respondent’s purported eligibility for adjustment of status over 10 years after he was ordered deported from the United States does not constitute an exceptional situation sufficient to warrant reopening in this matter. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

This matter is distinguishable from the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder ––– F.3d ––––, 2012 WL 34070 (5th Cir. 2012), wherein the court found that the Board abused its discretion by requiring an alien to exercise due diligence in moving to reopen his deportation proceedings in which he was ordered deported in absentia on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Unlike the alien in Rodriguez-Manzano, who was in pre-1992 deportation proceedings under section 242(b) of the Act, the respondent is in removal proceedings in which there are time limits on motion to reopen and reconsider. See id. at *2-*4.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia M. Medeiros
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was before the Board on December 18, 2009, when we issued our order denying the respondent’s motion for remand to seek adjustment of status, and dismissing her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2008, denial of her motion for a continuance. On April 19, 2011, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen these removal proceedings to pursue adjustment of status. The motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (90-day time limit for motion to reopen); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (same). The respondent asserts that the filing deadline has been tolled in her case due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a memorandum opposing the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Board’s previous order denied the respondent’s motion to remand and dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. See Board Order, 12/18/2009 at 2. The respondent is an arriving alien. See Exh. 1A. The Board based its decision in her case on Matter of Silitonga, 25 I&N Dec. 89 (BIA 2009), holding that Immigration Judges have no jurisdiction to adjudicate an application of an arriving alien for adjustment of status, with an exception that we determined to be inapplicable based on the record here. The instant motion fails to address the matter of jurisdiction.
 
Assuming, however, that for purpose of this motion the Board should exercise jurisdiction, the respondent fails to make a persuasive argument that she is entitled to equitable tolling of the filing deadline on account of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting her case, but the alien must show that she was prejudiced by counsel’s performance by demonstrating eligibility for relief, and must meet procedural requirements, including a detailed statement of the agreement entered into with former counsel, notice to former counsel and the opportunity to respond, and a complaint filed with disciplinary authorities. The instant motion includes very brief complaints filed with New York disciplinary authorities against four attorneys on April 8, 2011 (days before filing of the motion). See Motion to Reopen (untabbed exhibits). These complaints lack detail as called for by the complaint form itself as well as Lozada, and do not include any supporting documentation. The Board concludes that the respondent has not demonstrated substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements. Further, the complaints and the instant motion were brought 16 months after the Board’s last order in the case, a delay that indicates lack of due diligence. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252-53 (3rd Cir. 2005) (whether alien exercised due diligence is ordinarily a fact question, but 13-month delay in moving to reopen was conclusive so as to deny equitable tolling, despite alien’s difficulty in “navigating the shoals of American law” (citation omitted)). We conclude that the filing deadline for a motion to reopen has not been tolled in this case.
 
*2 Finally, the Board concludes that the instant motion does not indicate any exceptional situation for the Board to grant her request to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (the Board’s sua sponte authority is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations, and is not a general remedy for hardships created by enforcement of the time limit in the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied as untimely filed.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on August 18, 2011, when we denied the respondent’s motion for reconsideration of our denial of his previous motion to reopen these proceedings. The respondent has filed another motion to reconsider and a motion to remand. We will treat the respondent’s motion to remand as a motion to reopen. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 2000) (motions to remand filed after an administrative order has been issued are simply motions to reopen, and they are subject to the same time and numerical limitations as other motions to reopen). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. The respondent’s motion is precluded by regulation, as a party “may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The motion therefore will be denied as barred by regulation. Additionally, even if we reached the merits of the motion, it fails because the respondent has not identified any legal or factual error on the part of the Board. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is number-barred, as an alien may only file one motion to reopen. See Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will not equitably toll the number limitations, because the respondent has not established prejudice with respect to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced the case). As we explained in our denials of the respondent’s previous motion to reopen and motion for reconsideration, pursuing post-conviction relief through collateral attacks on convictions in state court does not affect the finality of those convictions for federal immigration purposes until they are in fact overturned or materially amended. See Decisions of the Board, dated August 18, 2011 and May 24, 2011; Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). Nor has the respondent demonstrated that he is entitled to relief with respect to his claim that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his plea agreements, where he has presented no evidence demonstrating that a criminal court in this matter found ineffective assistance by the respondent’s defense counsel. See generally Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). We also do not find any prejudice with respect to the respondent’s claim that previous counsel did not advise him to pursue voluntary departure, as we are not persuaded that the respondent would have been granted this discretionary form of relief, particularly given his criminal history.
 
*2 Further, the respondent has not shown an “exceptional situation” that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the rules governing motions are not meant to cure filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might cause hardship). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration and to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosaura Gonzalez Rucci, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Magdalena Ramos Romey
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 3, 2010. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge instructed the respondent to file his application for relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status by April 29, 2010. The respondent failed to comply with the filing deadline and he moved, through counsel, for a continuance and an extension of the filing deadline. Counsel indicated that she had been waiting for the respondent to supply a sponsorship affidavit in support of the application and simply “overlooked” the filing deadline. The Immigration Judge, in a decision date May 4, 2010, denied the motion indicating that insufficient reasons for failure to comply with the filing deadline were presented and declared the application for adjustment abandoned. The respondent filed a motion to reopen together with supporting documentation and a statement from counsel attributing the failure to file the application to her deficient performance. On May 17, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied reopening citing the respondent’s failure to submit an adjustment application with the motion, and incorporating the rationale of her May 4, 2010, decision. The Immigration Judge did not address counsel’s admission of ineffective assistance.
 
Upon our de novo review, we will reverse the decision of the Immigration Judge. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate sufficient reason for failing to file the respondent’s adjustment application. However, the respondent has also presented a plain instance of ineffective assistance of counsel that resulted in substantial prejudice, and we find that reopening is warranted on that basis. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Inasmuch as counsel conceded responsibility for missing the filing deadline, we do not find that strict compliance with the procedural requirements for claims of ineffective assistance set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), is necessary. Compare Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (declining to consider a claim of ineffective assistance in the absence of Lozada compliance when there was no showing of egregious conduct on the part of counsel). The record will be returned to the Immigration Court to provide the respondent with a further opportunity to seek relief from removal.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luis A. Defillo-Rosas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ronald B. Seely
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 29, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On October 24, 2011, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider and reopen urging that she received ineffective assistance of counsel and that proceedings should be reopened for reconsideration of her application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (providing that a motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority”); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion does not establish any error in our previous decision concluding that she is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). Moreover, the respondent does not argue that there was any error in the Board’s prior decision, but rather, requests that we reconsider our decision in light of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion does not provide any basis to conclude error in the Board’s ultimate decision; therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The motion is also in the nature of a motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Saakin v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent urges that the attorney who represented her at her hearing below and on appeal before the Board was ineffective because he failed to request nunc pro tunc an I-212 waiver for permission to reapply for admission into the United States after removal (Motion at 2). First, we note that the respondent was found to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), for being in the United States for an aggregate period of more than 1 year and then re-entering the United States without being admitted.1 There is no waiver of inadmissibility available for section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act. Matter of Briones, 24 I&N Dec. 355 (BIA 2007). To the extent that the respondent is arguing that a nunc pro tunc waiver of inadmissibility for illegal entry and status violations exists, we explained in Matter of Torres-Garcia, 23 I&N Dec. 866, 877 (BIA 2006), that the waiver available at 8 C.F.R. § 212.2 does not relate to the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C) of the Act. As the respondent remains ineligible for adjustment of status, she has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that she has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Finally, while the respondent requests sua sponte reopening, her motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent mistakenly asserts in the current motion that she was found inadmissible for being ordered removed and then re-entering the United States without being admitted, which would make her inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II) of the Act.

IN RE: EUGENE EUSTACE MAKUPA
File: AXXX XX8 702 - Kansas City, MO

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Hoppock, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer A. May
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Tanzania, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 23, 2010, granting him voluntary departure and noting both the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security had waived their right to appeal.1 The appeal will be considered and dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to await the outcome of a visa petition filed on his behalf, that he was ineffectively served by previous counsel, and that he did not knowingly waive his appeal rights. As it is not clear from the record that the respondent was properly advised of his right to appeal, we will consider the current appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent a further continuance, as the respondent did not make a persuasive showing of good cause for the request. An Immigration Judge is not obligated to suspend properly instituted removal proceedings indefinitely so that an alien can attempt to establish eligibility for relief, particularly in a case such as this where the outcome is speculative. The respondent blames his previous attorney for the length of these proceedings (Resp. Br. at 8). However, it is clear from the record that the respondent has failed to appear on several occasions before the Immigration Judge. Two orders of removal have been entered in absentia and his attorney appeared without the respondent at one time. Further the respondent appears to have missed interviews concerning the visa petitions. Tr. at 5, 8-10, 18-19, 35-36. In any event, despite his claim on appeal that the outcome of the visa petitions was not known, there was agreement below that the first two visa petitions filed on his behalf were denied (Tr. at 13, 35-36, 41-46). He argues that his previous attorney lost the evidence of a third filing, but the record still contains no documentary evidence that this petition was filed or approved. Upon de novo review, we conclude the Immigration Judge did not err in denying what would have been, at least, the respondent’s seventh continuance request concerning the visa petition. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). We also note that nearly 2 years have elapsed since the Immigration Judge entered his decision in this case and we have received no indication that the respondent’s latest visa petition has been approved.
 
*2 Further, the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which would warrant a remand of the record. The respondent has complied with many of the requirements set out in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d (6th Cir. 2006); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). However, even assuming that the respondent has established that his former counsel was ineffective, he has failed to show any prejudice from the actions of his prior counsel. See id; Hamid v.Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465 (6th Cir. 2003). That is, he has not shown that the outcome of his case may have been different absent the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Ortiz-Puentes v. Holder, 662 F.3d 481 (8th Cir. 2011) (respondent needs to show reasonable probability that, but for the alleged errors by counsel, the result of the case would be different), citing, Obleshchenko v. Ashcroft, 392 F.3d 970, 972 (8th Cir.2004) (same). The respondent conceded he was removable as charged and has not demonstrated eligibility for any relief from removal. See Matter of Almanza, 24 I&N Dec. 771 (BIA 2009) (burden on respondent to demonstrate eligibility for relief). The respondent’s charges of ineffective assistance of counsel do not undermine the Immigration Judge’s determination of removability and the respondent’s ineligibility for adjustment of status. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, therefore, fails.
 
As the Immigration Judge properly denied the continuance request and the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice from the actions of previous counsel, the appeal will be dismissed. As we have accepted the respondent’s appeal, we will reinstate voluntary departure for a period of 60 days. We caution the respondent, however, of the severe consequences of failing to depart the United States pursuant to a grant of this relief.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*3 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d)of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joan M. Powers, Esquire1
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brandon J. Josephsen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred and will be denied. The Board entered the final administrative order in this case on May 8, 2001, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered on June 12, 2000. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The current motion was filed more than 10 years after the Board’s decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion.
 
The respondent seeks to reopen these proceedings to pursue adjustment of status. However, a motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status does not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the motions time and number limits. Sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3).
 
Additionally, the respondent has not set forth “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Notably, the respondent’s potential eligibility for adjustment of status did not arise until his mother became a naturalized United States citizen on August 3, 2001, nearly 3 years after these proceedings commenced. Additionally, the visa petition (Form I-130) filed on the respondent’s behalf was not approved until March 19, 2007 nearly 6 years after the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. Becoming potentially eligible for relief, such as adjustment of status, after a final administrative order has been entered is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting consideration of an untimely motion to reopen.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent may be alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel, the claim has not been meaningfully raised, where the respondent has not shown compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Nor has the respondent shown due diligence or prejudice, where he has waited more than 10 years to assert the claim, and has not demonstrated how previous counsel’s alleged deficient performance prejudiced the respondent’s case. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that an alien must show prejudice when he advances an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and that “[p]rejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different”); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (alien must show that “the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered [the] hearing unfair”). We also note that the respondent’s discussion of new guidelines for prosecutorial discretion does not warrant reopening, as the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a matter for the DHS rather than the Board.2 See Respondent’s Response in Support of the Motion at 4.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul A. Suhr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa P. Durant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 11, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him og March 25, 2010. On September 30, 2011, the respondent filed the pending motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, to the extent the respondent could be construed as a motion to reconsider, the motion is untimely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Moreover, the respondent has not identified any error in the Board’s August 11, 2011, decision that found in part that he had received legal notice of the March 25, 2010, removal hearing. The respondent acknowledged that he had been personally served with the Notice of Appear and that he had received that initial Notice of Hearing, both of which documents warned him of his duty to notify the Immigration Court of any change of address within 5 days of the change, and that he did not file a notice of his change of address with the Immigration Court after he moved to New York.
 
Turning to his request for reopening, the pending motion is untimely filed and number barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000). The respondent’s present motion urges that both of his prior attorneys failed to effectively represent him. However, the respondent’s motion fails to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, and separately, the motion fails to adequately demonstrate prejudice as the respondent’s failure to timely advise the Immigration Court of his change of address occurred months before he first consulted with counsel.
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided us with an adequate basis to excuse the fact that his motion is both untimely and number barred. Nor has he demonstrated any exceptional circumstance that would warrant the reopening of these proceedings under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shawn Beam, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sandra J. Santos
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2010, written decision denying her untimely motion to reopen her administratively final removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has submitted a brief in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and discretionary decisions, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that her untimely motion to reopen should be granted because the ineffective assistance of prior counsel resulted in her failure to attend the August 27, 2007, removal hearing at which she was ordered removed in absentia. She seeks to invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling. See generally Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2000). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen because the respondent did not establish that she had in fact retained the services of the accused attorney, or that any alleged ineffective assistance of ostensive prior counsel prevented her from attending her August 27, 2007, removal hearing.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent had notice of her August 27, 2007, removal hearing.1 The respondent alleges, however, that she retained the services of an attorney who assured her that he would have her hearing rescheduled for a later date.
 
The respondent has not specified the date on which she allegedly retained the services of the attorney against whom she now raises a claim of ineffective assistance.2 Notably, the respondent herself, unrepresented by counsel, sent a letter to the Immigration Court requesting another delay in her removal proceedings a matter of days before her August 27, 2007, removal hearing. Moreover, the attorney whom the respondent claims to have previously retained has submitted a response to the respondent’s allegations, indicating that he was not retained to represent the respondent before the Immigration Court. The record does not contain a Form EOIR-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative before the Immigration Court, for the attorney in question.
 
In light of the above, the respondent has not established clear error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not demonstrate that she had engaged ostensive former counsel to represent her in removal proceedings. Thus, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s absence from her August 27, 2007, removal hearing was not excused by ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion to reopen was therefore properly denied.3 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s motion to reopen her in absentia removal order is therefore subject to a 180-day filing deadline. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1).

2

We note that the respondent submitted a letter to the Immigration Court with a certificate of service dated August 23, 2007, which was signed by the respondent, rather than by counsel.

3

Furthermore, we agree with the DHS’s position that the respondent did not act with the requisite due diligence to warrant tolling of the 180-day filing deadline. The in absentia order of removal was mailed to the respondent at her address of record. The respondent has not denied receiving the properly addressed order. The record thus reflects that the respondent was put on notice that she had been ordered removed from the United States nearly 2 1/2 years before she filed her untimely motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. See generally Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). She explains no efforts she made to pursue her case between “some months” after she was ordered removed in absentia in August 2007, and an unspecified point in 2009. See Respondent’s Motion at Attachment B. Current counsel’s statement that the respondent contacted the Immigration Court regarding the status of her case in mid-2008 (Respondent’s Brief at 2-3) is not evidence. See generally Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980) (holding that counsel’s statements are not evidence). As the respondent did not file her motion to reopen until nearly 2 years after the window in which to file a timely motion had closed, and she has not shown that she has diligently pursued her case, the belated reopening of her administratively final removal proceedings would not be warranted even if the respondent had established that she retained former counsel and that his ineffective assistance prevented her from attending her August 27, 2007, removal hearing. See generally Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090,1095-97 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding that alien had failed to act with due diligence).

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **
 
U.S. Department of Justice
Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: IRMA DIANA TILLETT
File: AXXX XX8 365 - Los Angeles, CA
January 19, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicklaus Misiti, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on March 14, 2003, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s order of removal. The respondent’s motion, filed over 8 years later on November 2, 2011, is not timely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues the time limits for motions should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance by prior counsel. The untimeliness of an alien’s motion may be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien can show diligence, prejudice resulting from the attorney’s ineffective assistance, and compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003) (a petitioner may obtain equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel as long as he “act[ed] with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”). See also Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011) (setting forth requirements for due diligence).
 
The respondent has not established due diligence. The respondent argues that she received ineffective assistance in 1999 when her attorney did not tell her to attend an interview for an I-130 petition; that her attorney should have informed the respondent of her disbarment so she could have had representation at her hearing on March 2, 2001; that a second attorney hired to file her appeal ceased returning her phone calls; and that another firm she hired on April 11, 2003, “took no action and she was forced to sue them to get her money back”1 (Motion at 4).
 
The respondent knew of the purported ineffective assistance of these attorneys as early as 1999, 2001, and 2003, respectively. Her motion does not reflect that she took any action after 2003 until the filing of the present motion. A letter from the New York Legal Assistance Group reflects that she contacted them in March 2007, for “assistance with applying for her green card” and she contacted them again on October 22, 2010 “for assistance with another immigration matter” (Motion, Exhibit I). This is insufficient to demonstrate due diligence in pursuing this case. Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
As the respondent has not shown due diligence, she has not established that equitable tolling of the time limits is warranted. The regulatory time limits will be applied to this motion.
 
*2 The respondent also requests sua sponte reopening. We do have the discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings in limited, “exceptional” situations. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We have examined the respondent’s allegations in this case, including the hardship her family would suffer upon her removal. However, we find no exceptional situation in this case such that sua sponte reopening would be warranted.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Her affidavit reflects that she hired them because she “was having some problems with [her] husband and they told [her she] could get a green card through that,” but that when the respondent and her husband reconciled she and the firm “stopped the case” (Motion, Exhibit G).
