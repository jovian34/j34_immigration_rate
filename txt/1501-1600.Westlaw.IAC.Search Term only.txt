ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick A. Metcalf, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1) (B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the January 30, 2006, decision of the Immigration Judge which found that the respondent had abandoned his application for adjustment of status. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994) (noting that the adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge in whole or in part is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). We observe that the Immigration Judge informed the respondent, on October 4, 2005, of his obligation to have his fingerprints taken¿FN2º in time for the continuation of his merits hearing on January 30, 2006, and warned him that, if he failed to do so, his application to adjust status would be deemed abandoned. See Tr. at 11. The respondent did not comply with this directive. See Tr. at 16-17; I.J. at 3-4. In this regard, applicable regulations provide that an alien’s failure to comply with an Immigration Judge’s order to provide biometrics and other biographical information constitutes appropriate grounds for abandonment, absent good cause. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(c). On appeal, the respondent argues that his inaction was due to the “incompetence” of his prior attorney, who allegedly “failed to take any steps on behalf of his client.” See Respondent’s Brief at 2. To the extent that the respondent is claiming that his failure to comply with the Immigration Judge’s order was due to his having received ineffective assistance from his prior counsel, we note that the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth by this Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to appropriately pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See also Patel v. Gonzales, No. 06-3077, 2007 WL 2255213 (7th Cir. Aug. 8, 2007). We disagree with the respondent’s assertions (see “Brief in Support of Appeal,” at 2, item 7) that he has complied with the Lozada requirements. Specifically, the respondent failed to submit a properly executed affidavit setting forth his agreement with his prior attorney.¿FN3º The respondent failed to demonstrate that he notified his prior attorney of his allegations against that attorney, and that he gave that attorney an opportunity to respond to those allegations.¿FN4º Additionally, although the respondent submitted a photocopy of an online document titled “Request for Investigation of a Lawyer Form,” purportedly obtained from the Illinois Supreme Court’s Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission’s website, there is no evidence in the record that the respondent filed a formal complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Thus, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent abandoned his application to adjust status. Moreover, as pointed out by the Immigration Judge in his decision, citing Sections 212 and 213 ¿Aº of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1183a (see I.J. at 5-6), the respondent also failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the respondent’s petition to remand this case for further proceedings is denied.

1

On November 29, 2006, the respondent filed with this Board two separate briefs titled “Motion to Reopen” and “Brief in Support of Appeal,” respectively. The “Motion to Reopen,” seemingly seeking to reopen the Immigration Judge’s January 30, 2006, decision, was untimely and not filed with the Immigration Court, as required by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Thus, only the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding his adjustment of status application abandoned is properly before this Board.

2

The necessity to obtain the respondent’s fingerprints was further underlined by the fact that it appeared that the respondent had several criminal convictions. See Tr. at 7-10; Exh. 3.

3

Both the respondent’s prior attorney and his new attorney were part of the same law firm. See Tr. at 17.

4

In his brief titled “Motion to Reopen,” the respondent indicates that he mailed a copy of his alleged complaint to his prior attorney’s last known address, but we note that such alleged complaint shows no indication that that action was actually taken.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bradford H. Bernstein, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the Immigration Judge’s May 31, 2007, decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind a removal order entered in absentia on March 7, 2007.
 
The record reveals that on or about June 22, 2007, while this appeal was pending before the Board, the respondent, an arriving alien, was removed from the United States. Unlike other aliens, the departure of an arriving alien subsequent to the taking of an appeal does not constitute the withdrawal of the appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, held in Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 462 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2006), that “the order of removal may be rescinded upon motion to re-open filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice.” Id. at 1317. Therefore, in accordance with federal regulations and the Court’s decision in Contreras-Rodriguez, the Board will retain jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen alleging that she did not have notice of the March 7, 2007, hearing wherein she was ordered removed in absentia.
 
On May 18, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered on March 7, 2007, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See section 240(b)(5)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(b)(5). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion. He determined that the respondent did not comply with the Lozada requirements and failed to establish that she had retained Ms. Dahlia M. French. Accordingly, he concluded that the respondent failed to demonstrate that her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances.
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s findings. She asserts that she substantially complied with the Lozada requirements. She claims that she retained Ms. French in June 2003, to assist her with these removal proceedings. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish the nature and extent of Ms. French’s representation. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment E (unsigned retainer agreement). Additionally, Ms. French’s failure to advise the respondent of her obligation to inform the Court of her change of address in her 2003 letter is not tantamount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment E (June 24, 2003, letter from Ms. French to the respondent).
 
*2 However, the record reveals that the respondent was found inadmissible as charged without any evidence of record to support such a finding. The Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order states that the “Immigration and Naturalization Service submitted documentary evidence relating to the respondent which established the truth of the factual, allegations contained in the Notice to Appear.” Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s order, there is no documentation in this record to establish the truth of the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear (NTA). The record before the Immigration Judge contained only the NTA, the Notice of Hearing (NOH) and a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213) that does not relate to this respondent.
 
Additionally, the record reflects that the NTA was mailed to the respondent on or about March 31, 2003. The respondent does not deny receiving the NTA which informs her of her address obligations. However, the NTA was not filed with the Immigration Court in Atlanta, Georgia until, January 11, 2007, nearly four years after it was served on the respondent. During those four intervening years, an attempt to file an EOIR-33 Form would be unsuccessful because removal proceedings were not initiated until January 11, 2007. On February 23, 2007, a Notice of Hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent - at the address listed on the NTA - notifying her of a March 7, 2007; hearing. The respondent states that she did not receive the NOH. The record of proceeding contains no evidence that the address used was in fact the respondent’s address of record. We find that the 4-year delay in initiating these proceedings is an equitable factor in the respondent’s favor, as she had no ability to file a change of address. Based on the totality of circumstances presented here, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained and the appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The in absentia removal order entered in this case on March 7, 2007, is rescinded, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Storm, Maia J.
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Waiver under section 216(c)(4) of the Act
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Gambia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s May 15, 2007, removal order. The record will be remanded for further proceedings and for the entry of a new decision.
 
The Immigration Judge’s oral decision in this case consists of a single sentence and is devoid of any factual findings or legal analysis. An explanation of the reasons for his decision in the transcript is insufficient. Accordingly, we will remand this case to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a full decision addressing the respondent’s removability and his eligibility for relief from removal. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 463-65 (BIA 2002) (remanding for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision because of the Immigration Judge’s “almost complete lack of factual findings and legal analysis”); Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468, 477 (BIA 1999) (stating that the Immigration Judge is “responsible for the substantive completeness of the decision”).
 
On appeal, the respondent has submitted a new Form I-751 Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence. He seeks a waiver from filing a joint petition to remove the conditions of his permanent residence on the basis that his removal would result in extreme hardship. See section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(A). We are precluded from considering this new claim on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 1(d)(3)(iv). Inasmuch as we are already remanding these proceedings for the entry of a new decision, however, we will also remand this matter to the Immigration Judge for consideration. While we recognize that the Immigration Judge lacks authority to adjudicate the respondent’s Form I-751 in the first instance, see 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(c), (f); Matter of Lemhammad, 20 I&N Dec. 316, 323 (BIA 1991), the Immigration Judge should consider whether the respondent is prima facie eligible for a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Act and whether a continuance is warranted for the respondent to pursue such relief before the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”). See Matter of Mendes, 20 I&N Dec. 833, 840 (BIA 1994). Finally, given the respondent’s concerns on appeal regarding the quality of representation he obtained below, the respondent should be afforded an opportunity to seek new counsel to present his claims on remand. See generally Sene v. Gonzalez, 453 F.3d 383, 388-89 (6th Cir. 2006) (ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceeding is a violation of due process).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The Immigration Judge certified his decision dated January 24, 2006, to the Board. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge was incorrect, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Cuba who was paroled into the United States in 2000. On February 13, 2003, he was found removable as charged by the Immigration Judge, and ineligible for any form of relief. On May 3, 2004, the Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of this decision for failure to file a brief. On December 10, 2004, we reopened the proceedings because the respondent established that the brief was not filed due to ineffective assistance of counsel. We also found that the respondent had established prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, and that the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction over this application. The record was remanded so that the respondent could apply for any form of relief for which he was eligible. We included a footnote that we could not sustain the Immigration Judge’s finding about the fraud charge in the absence of the videotape of the respondent’s joint interview which was referred to by both parties and the Immigration Judge.
 
On remand, the respondent sought to pursue his adjustment application. Rather than addressing the application, the Immigration Judge merely reinstated his prior decision, and certified the record to the Board upon noting that the videotape in question was enclosed.
 
We are remanding the record because the Immigration Judge failed to abide by our prior order to adjudicate the respondent’s applications for relief, including his request under the Cuban Adjustment Act. We clarify that our footnote regarding the fraud charge was a statement that we needed all of the evidence relied upon by the Immigration Judge to uphold the finding. The record now includes the videotape. However, without a transcript from the related proceeding, we decline to find that it is evidence properly prepared for our review. This matter should be addressed by the parties on remand, and a transcript provided if this evidence is relied upon. The Immigration Judge must also address the respondent’s application for adjustment, barring its withdrawal. We point out that if the fraud charge is sustained, the Immigration Judge must consider the respondent’s argument regarding the availability of a waiver of inadmissibility. An appropriate order will be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexandre I. Afanassiev, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dean F. Emmons
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; voluntary departure
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on March 26, 2007, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application for registry, and granted the respondent’s application for voluntary departure pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order below. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen, arguing that he never paid the bond required for voluntary departure pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3), because his former attorney of record had erroneously advised him that it was not necessary if an appeal were timely filed. The respondent has submitted documentation to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, see Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the record contains evidence that this Board has suspended respondent’s former counsel from practicing before the Board and the Immigration Courts. Finally, the DHS filed a response to the motion indicating that it is not opposed to reopening and remanding the record for the limited issue of redetermining the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure.
 
We note that, pursuant to the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3), if the respondent, in fact, failed to post his bond for voluntary departure within 5 business days of the Immigration Judge’s order, the alternate order of removal to Mexico took effect, and we did not have jurisdiction to reinstate the grant of voluntary departure in our adjudication of the appeal on March 26, 2007. However, the record does not contain any evidence that the respondent did not post the bond. Nevertheless, given the response from the DHS indicating its non-opposition to the pending motion, it appears that the DHS is not questioning this fact. Therefore, given the totality of the circumstances in this case, in particular the DHS’s qualified non-opposition response, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, and we will remand the record to the Immigration Court with specific instructions to only consider the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted, and our decision of March 26, 2007, is vacated to the extent that it granted the respondent 60 days of voluntary departure.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dennis Grossman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nancy DeFrank
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia in a November 10, 2005, Immigration Judge’s decision. Thereafter the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings essentially claiming exceptional circumstances prevented her from appearing at her hearing. The Immigration Judge granted the motion in a February 1, 2006, summary order. However, on June 7, 2006, the Immigration Judge issued a decision in which he sua sponte reconsidered his February 1, 2006, order, rescinded the same, and denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. On appeal, the respondent contends the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in reconsidering his initial grant of the motion to reopen.¿FN1º
 
We agree. As the respondent notes, this Board has held that both our and the Immigration Judges’ power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). In so holding, we recognized the important principle of finality as applied to immigration proceedings, noting the need to discourage dilatory motions and Congress’ mandate that we issue regulations to do so. Id.; see also Matter of G-D-, (emphasizing the importance of administrative finality and finding that sua sponte consideration of an untimely motion that is based on new law is generally warranted only when the new law amounts to a reversal of the law applied in the case).
 
Here, the Immigration Judge provided no reason for reconsidering his original decision four months after it was rendered. Instead, he merely cited his authority to reconsider on his own motion any case in which he has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested in the Board (I.J. at 2), citing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). However, the Immigration Judge failed to state any reason, much less identify an “extraordinary situation,” that prompted his reconsideration of the February 1, 2006, decision. Review of the record for clarification in this regard is fruitless as there is no evidence of record, such as a motion or other document from the Department of Homeland Security or the respondent, relating to the Immigration Judge’s decision to reconsider his order granting the motion. Moreover, as the Immigration Judge issued a summary order granting the motion, review of this decision fails to reveal any legal error supporting the Immigration Judge’s decision to reconsider the same. Given this record, the Board is unable to discern the basis for the Immigration Judge’s decision to reconsider his prior order sua sponte. In this regard we further note that the Immigration Judge who issued the decisions in question is no longer on the bench. As such, a remand for an explanation of the Immigration Judge’s reasons for reconsidering his original decision is not a viable option. Thus, we cannot determine whether an exceptional situation was presented supporting the Immigration Judge’s decision to reconsider.
 
*2 As the Immigration Judge failed to identify any exceptional situation supporting reconsideration of a decision he had issued four months previously; his decision to reconsider his prior order is not supported by the record. In this regard, we note the concern over finality of the proceedings applies not just to the government, but also to the alien, who needs to know the correct posture of his or her case in order to take appropriate action thereto. This is particularly true given the extended passage of time after which the Immigration Judge decided to reconsider his own order. Therefore we find it appropriate to vacate the Immigration Judge’s June 7, 2006, decision, and remand the record in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to pursue any relief for which she may be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s June 7, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision, and for the entry of the new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nancy C. Acevedo, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and Reopening
 
In a decision dated November 15, 2004, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent, a legal permanent resident since January 28, 2000, removed from the United States based on the respondent’s concession of the charge of being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and his subsequently filed “Motion to Vacate Master Hearing, Withdraw Intent to Apply for Immigration Relief, and Petition for Removal” (hereinafter “the Motion”) received in November 2004. See section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (hereinafter “Act”). The respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s removal order. The respondent filed motions to reconsider and reopen with the Immigration Judge on April 10, 2007. On May 10, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motions to reconsider and reopen on the bases that the motions were untimely and that the respondent’s motions were not subject to equitable tolling as he had failed to substantially comply with the requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (ruling that to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim a respondent should submit an affidavit explaining his agreement with former counsel, present evidence that prior counsel has been informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond, and show that a complaint was filed with the proper disciplinary authorities or explain why no such complaint was filed.) The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s motions to reconsider and reopen are untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent argues that he was the subject of a gross injustice as the Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter “DHS”) failed to meet its burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence that he had committed a crime involving moral turpitude and was removable under the Act. While the respondent concedes that he was convicted in July 2004 under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) for committing an assault upon his spouse by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury to her, he argues that this conviction did not qualify under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act as a crime of moral turpitude as his initial felony conviction was later reduced in September 2004 to a misdemeanor and he was sentenced to serve only 137 days in a county jail. There is no doubt that the respondent’s knowing use of force to produce great bodily harm on his own spouse is a crime of moral turpitude. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921-22 (9th Cir. 1993) (ruling that willful infliction of a traumatic injury to a spouse is a crime involving moral turpitude); Gonzales v. Barber, 207 F.2d 398, 400 (9th Cir. 1953), aff’d on other grounds, 347 U.S. 637 (1954) (holding that a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) is a crime involving moral turpitude as it evidences a criminal heart and a criminal tendency); Matter of G-R-, 2 I&N Dec. 733 (BIA 1946, A.G. 1947) (ruling that Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) is a crime of moral turpitude as the convicted individual intended to do bodily injury on another person).¿FN1º Cf. Matter of Sanudo, 23 I&N 968, 971 (BIA 2006) (holding that a conviction for domestic battery under Cal. Penal Code § 243(e)(1) did not qualify categorically as a crime involving moral turpitude because a person can be convicted of this offense without using violence, injuring, or even intending to injure the victim.) The fact that the California court characterized this crime as a misdemeanor or that the respondent was actually imprisoned for less than a year is irrelevant, as the section 247(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) only requires that a “sentence of one year or more may be imposed.” (Emphasis added.) The provisions of Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) fully meet the requirements of section 247(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, as the California statute clearly indicates that a conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) may include a prison term up to four years. Regardless, the respondent conceded to the charge under section 247(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act listed on his Notice to Appear.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent contends that he has “per se” complied with the Lozada, supra, requirements as there is clear and obvious evidence of ineffective assistance rendered by his counsel Hugo F. Larios, even though he has not filed any formal complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or directly contacted Mr. Larios regarding these allegations. See Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006) (excusing failure to comply with the Lozada, supra, requirements because ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudice were clearly evident in the record.) The appellant claims that Mr. Larios informed him that due to his two felony criminal convictions¿FN2º he was ineligible for any type of relief from removal, submitted the Motion of November 2004 apparently without the respondent’s consent, and thereafter refused to further assist the respondent with his removal proceedings. The respondent claims that Mr. Larios’ actions “completely defeated” him and at his subsequent hearing accepted the Immigration Judge’s removal order without any protest. It is further argued by the respondent that Mr. Larios conceded to the Immigration Court that the respondent had committed aggravated felonies and this was the basis for the Immigration Judge’s removal order.
 
We find that the respondent has substantially mischaracterized the presentations and arguments rendered by Mr. Larios in the Motion. While the Motion quoted a large section of 212(h) of the Act, which included a discussion of aggravated felonies, Mr. Larios never conceded that the respondent had ever been convicted of a felony. There is no mention in the Motion of the respondent’s first conviction for statutory rape and he characterized the respondent’s second conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) as a misdemeanor. The quoted section of 212(h) was done to inform the Immigration Court that the respondent was ineligible for a waiver of removal as the respondent had not lived continuously in the United States for 7 years after being admitted as a legal permanent resident in January 2000. There is nothing in the respondent’s statements, motion, or brief that touches on why Mr. Larios cited to the respondent’s residence status in the Motion or how this admission amounted to ineffective assistance. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000) (rejecting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as the alien failed to show how he was prejudiced by the actions of his counsel.) These inconsistencies and mischaracterizations show that the respondent has failed to establish that he was the victim of clear and obvious ineffective assistance of counsel and reveals the wisdom of our holding in Lozada, supra, requiring that counsel be informed of the alleged infractions and allowed to comment on these claims. See Lozada, supra, at 639 (commenting that where essential information is lacking, it is impossible to evaluate the substance of claims for ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the potential for abuse is apparent when there is no mechanism for allowing former counsel to present their version of events.) Therefore, we find that equitable tolling is not appropriate in this case as the respondent, even considering that he may not have discovered the alleged harm until he had obtained new counsel in early 2005, failed to substantially comply with the Lozada, supra, requirements.
 
*3 Furthermore, the respondent alleges that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in denying the motions for reconsideration and reopening as there is evidence of a gross miscarriage of justice that resulted in the removal order of November 2004. As discussed above, the respondent’s presentations have significant errors of mischaracterization and omission when compared with the record and he has not established that a gross miscarriage of justice has occurred. Thus, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion.
 
The respondent has not argued that any of the other recognized exceptions to the time restrictions to motions to reconsider and reopen are applicable to his case, nor does the record reflect that the conditions for such exceptions exist. In addition, we note that DHS has not joined in any motion to reconsider or reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iv). For these reasons, the respondent’s motions will be dismissed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that in Carr v. INS, 86 F.3d 949, 951 (9th Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit simply stated, without any analysis, that convictions under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(2) (assault upon another person with a firearm) were not crimes involving moral turpitude and cited to its prior decision in Komarenko v. INS, 35 F.3d 432 (9th Cir. 1994) as precedent on this matter. However, in Komarenko, supra, the Ninth Circuit briefly noted that where an alien’s conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(2) could be a crime of moral turpitude, possession of a firearm will not always be a crime of moral turpitude, nor will crimes of moral turpitude necessarily involve firearms. Id. at 435. The respondent’s case is distinguishable from Carr, supra, and Komarenko, supra, on its facts, since the respondent was convicted under a different subsection of Cal. Penal Code § 245 than the alien in Carr, supra, and Komarenko, supra, and is governed by the on-point decision in Gonzales v. Barber, supra.

The respondent acknowledges that he was previously convicted in 1995 of statutory rape, but maintains that this charge was later reduced to a misdemeanor. He further claims that in a decision of January 28, 2000, an Immigration Judge found this charge was not an aggravated felony or crime involving moral turpitude, that it was a “petty offense,” granted an application for cancellation of removal, and granted the respondent’s status as a legal permanent resident. If Mr. Larios had actually informed the respondent that his second misdemeanor conviction made him ineligible for a petty offense exception, this advice would have been correct. See section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. Furthermore, the respondent acknowledges that he failed to inform Mr. Larios of his prior conviction for statutory rape until he was confronted with this conviction record at a hearing before the Immigration Judge, actions that could support a defense against an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013, 1023 (9th Cir. 2004) (ruling that counsel’s actions did not cause prejudice because alien failed to inform counsel of critical facts.)

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael P. Rummel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 25, 2006, decision denying as abandoned his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) urges affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge set a filing deadline of July 14, 2006, for the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 20). The respondent’s former counsel filed a motion to extend the deadline until August 14, 2006, due to “lack of contact with Respondent since May 15, 2006,” which was granted by the Immigration Judge on July 25, 2006. On August 3, 2006, the respondent’s former attorney moved to withdraw as counsel and requested a further extension of the filing deadline, stating that the respondent had “demonstrated an utter refusal to cooperate in any way or take any responsibility for his application and removal defense,” and that due to the respondent’s “total lack of cooperation,” he was unable to effectively represent him. On August 21, 2006, the Immigration Judge granted the motion to withdraw and extended the filing deadline until September 14, 2006. The record reflects that the August 21, 2006, order was mailed to both the respondent and his former counsel. On September 25, 2006, when the respondent failed to file the application for cancellation of removal by the September 14, 2006, deadline, the Immigration Judge issued an order denying the application as abandoned, finding the respondent removable as charged, and ordering the respondent removed to Mexico.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to file the application by the court-imposed deadline. He asserts that he “properly submitted documentary evidence to his representative to establish prima facie eligibility for Cancellation of Removal,” and that his former counsel should have “perfected the filing of his application.” The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to grant him cancellation of removal, asserting that he proved all the elements for this form of relief.¿FN1º
 
The record reflects that the respondent has failed to comply complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 63 7, 639 (BIA 1988).¿FN2º While the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that substantial compliance may be appropriate, the respondent in this case has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003). Regardless of his compliance, we nevertheless find that the respondent has failed to establish that former counsel’s performance was deficient. As noted above, former counsel moved to withdraw alleging that the respondent’s failure to cooperate had prevented him from preparing and filing an application for cancellation of removal. While the respondent states in his brief that he provided all the necessary documentation to his former counsel to enable him to prepare the filing, he failed to submit an affidavit either outlining his contacts with counsel or specifying the documentation submitted, and he failed to attach any documentation to his brief or to submit the cancellation application. Based on this record, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance.
 
*2 Even assuming that the performance of his former attorney was deficient, we also find that the respondent has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by counsel’s representation. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 859 (9th Cir. 2004) (an alien may prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance if he establishes that counsel’s deficient performance “may have affected the proceedings”); Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir. 1986). By failing to submit any affidavit or documentation, or the application for the requested relief, the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel’s allegedly defective performance affected the outcome of the proceedings. Finally, based on this record, we find no error with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the application for cancellation of removal as abandoned. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Enrique Rosario, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated April 26, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance in order for him to seek a vacateur of his criminal conviction in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The respondent has appealed that decision. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996); Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983).
 
The respondent alleges on appeal that he is pursing a motion to withdraw his guilty plea before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and had requested a motion for a continuance of removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge. However, the respondent has submitted no evidence that any post-conviction relief has been granted. Therefore, the evidence supports a finding that the respondent’s conviction is a final conviction for immigration purposes. Additionally, an Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding his guilt or innocence. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent also argues on appeal that, due to ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not knowingly enter his guilty plea to one count of false claim of United States citizenship. To the extent that the respondent has attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Swaim, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of Status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s June 14, 2006, decision, wherein the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). On appeal, the respondent claims that he should be deemed to have constructively filed his labor certification before April 30, 2001, and, consequently, he should be “grandfathered” under section 245(i) of the Act. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is statutorily ineligible to adjust his status under section 245(i) of the Act. Here, the labor certification was not filed on or before April 30, 2001, as prescribed by section 245(i) of the Act (I.J. at 2-4; see also Tr. at 11; Exh. 1). See 245(i)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(1)(B)(ii); Ali v. Gonzales, 440 F.3d 678, 680 (5th Cir. 2006) (stating that an alien is only eligible to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act if the labor certification application was filed on or before April 30, 2001).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that the labor certification was not timely filed due to the malfeasance of his attorney. Interestingly, rather than claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, as he did at the trial level, the respondent now claims that his prior counsel’s conduct, as an officer of the court, “reflect¿º¿sº on the government” (Resp’t’s Br. at 4), and that the Board should deem his labor certification as “constructively filed by April 30, 2001 ¿,º” (id.). In support of this claim, the respondent cites In the Matter of Naturalization of 68 Filipino War Veterans, 406 F. Supp. 931 (N.D. Cal. 1975). The respondent’s reliance on that case is misplaced. Filipino War Veterans, a case arising in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, is not binding authority because the case at bar arises in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.¿FN1 º In addition, Filipino War Veterans is factually distinguishable from the case at bar. In Filipino War Veterans, particular veterans were unable to apply for naturalization because the Government refused to act on their applications, Id. at 939. In this case, by contrast, the respondent was unable to apply for adjustment of status because his private attorney failed to timely file the respondent’s labor certification. Further, the respondent fails to cite to any authority for the proposition that the misconduct of his private attorney can somehow be imputed to the Government.
 
*2 In any event, April 30, 2001, is a fixed statutory cut-off deadline set by Congress. To be “grandfathered” pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, the respondent’s labor certification needed to be “properly filed pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of Labor” and “approvable” when filed on or before the requisite cut-off date. See section 212(a)(5)(A)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 245.10(a)(1)(i)(B), (2)(ii), (3) (2007). Because the Department of Labor has sole jurisdiction in certifying or denying labor certification applications, see 20 C.F.R. §§ 656.24, .26, neither the Board nor an Immigration Judge has the jurisdiction to create the equitable remedy the respondent seeks. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In support of his constructive filing argument, the respondent also relies on In the Matter of Benoit, 10 Cal.3d 72, 514 P.2d 97 (Cal. 1973). This case is also of no precedential value and factually distinguishable from the case at bar because it involves the interpretation of state criminal law in a habeas corpus proceeding. In addition, the court only extended the principle of constructive filing to situations where a defendant is incarcerated or otherwise in custody, has been notified of his appeal rights by a judge, and has made an arrangement with his trial attorney to file a notice of appeal for him. Id. at 86.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adedayo O. Idowu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nelson A. Vargas-Padilla
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopen
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before us on July 9, 2007, when we decided to reconsider sua sponte our previous decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, and to vacate that decision and reinstate the respondent’s prior motion to reopen. The respondent moves the Board to equitably toll the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen and to reopen proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, Mr. Gayton J. Thomas, Jr. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion.
 
The respondent does not challenge that at a removal hearing on January 26, 2005, an Immigration Judge gave him until February 25, 2005, to file his application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, based on his marriage to a United States citizen.¿FN1º At the time, the respondent was represented by Mr. Thomas. The application was not filed by the deadline, which led to the Immigration Judge determining that the respondent had abandoned his request for relief, and eventually facing removal from the United States.
 
We find that the respondent’s affidavit, and copies of correspondence to Mr. Thomas and the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland with proof of delivery and receipt provided with the motion substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006). However, after taking into consideration the respondent’s arguments in his motion, and the supporting documents, in conjunction with the documents already made a part of the record, we find that the respondent has not established that his failure to file his adjustment of status application by the ordered deadline was due to ineffective assistance by Mr. Thomas. In a motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge, Mr. Thomas stated that the respondent’s adjustment application was not timely filed due to the respondent’s lack of funds. This allegation is denied in the motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel filed with the Board, but we find insufficient evidence to support the respondent’s contention in his motion. The respondent indicated in his affidavit that he paid a total of $2,400 to Mr. Thomas, but he does not state when the money was paid or for what purpose. Also, we note that the respondent’s affidavit does not set forth in detail what contact, if any, the respondent had with Mr. Thomas during the time between January 26, 2005, and February 25, 2005. Therefore, we find insufficient evidence in the record from which we can reasonably conclude that the adjustment application was not timely filed for reasons other than the respondent’s own conduct. Given that we do not find ineffective assistance with regard to the filing of the adjustment application, we need not address the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance and prejudice resulting from Mr. Thomas’ subsequent actions.
 
*2 Further, as we find that the respondent has not demonstrated a valid claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, we find it unnecessary to address whether equitable tolling of the time limits for motions to reopen would be recognized in this instance. Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s stay request is denied.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43)(R)) (withdrawn)

Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B))
  
APPLICATION: Dismissal of aggravated felony charge; cancellation of removal
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s April 18, 2007, decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found, inter alia, that the respondent was removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), for having been convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to the provisions of section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), to wit, a drug trafficking crime. The Immigration Judge further determined that the respondent was ineligible to seek cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of facts, by an Immigration Judge, including those as to the credibility of testimony, to determine whether the findings are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).¿FN1º The Board may review all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues on appeal from decisions of the Immigration Judge “de novo.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iii).
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, sustained a 2006 Texas conviction for the offense of delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 481.112¿FN2º, for which he was sentenced to a 3 year term of probation. (Gp. Exh. 2).
 
The respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s determination of removability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony on the basis of his 2006 conviction. He asserts that the statute under which he was convicted encompasses offenses such as offering to sell, which is not an aggravated felony. He further asserts that he is eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 In a recently issued decision, the Supreme Court in Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47, 127 S. Ct. 625, (2006), held that a state offense constitutes a “felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act” only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law. The term aggravated felony is defined by section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act to include “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code).” Pursuant to Lopez v. Gonzales, supra, the respondent’s 2006 conviction qualifies as a drug-trafficking aggravated felony because it is analogous to the federal offense of distributing or dispensing of cocaine, a felony violation of the Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). See 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). A drug offense is a “felony” under the CSA if it is punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year. 21 U.S.C. § 802(13), (44); 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a). Absent enhancements for quantity and recidivism, distribution of cocaine is punishable under the CSA by a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, by reason of the respondent’s 2006 conviction, he is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.¿FN3º Moreover, the Board is in agreement with the Immigration Judge that, as the respondent is an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, he is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
The respondent raises several procedural due process arguments on appeal, claiming that he did not have adequate notice of the charges against him because of the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) amendment to the Notice to Appear, depriving him of his right to a full and fair removal hearing. We sympathize with the respondent’s sense of frustration and understand that he may have been confused by the DHS’ attempts to charge him properly, but on the facts of this case we do not find that the conduct of his hearing was in derogation of his right to due process of law. Specifically, we are not persuaded that the respondent suffered substantial prejudice as a result of the DHS’ lodging of charges or the Immigration Judge’s decision declining to grant a continuance. Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981) (absent substantial prejudice, there is no due process violation). The respondent’s removability and ineligibility for relief from removal are legal consequences that flow automatically from his aggravated felony conviction, and he has not identified any fact or legal argument, not communicated to the Immigration Judge as a result of the conduct of his hearing, that could have substantially altered the outcome of his proceedings had they been communicated.
 
*3 The record also reflects that respondent’s counsel advised the Immigration Judge that post-conviction relief was in order for the 2006 conviction as the respondent had received ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of the criminal proceeding, and was not properly advised of the immigration consequences of entering a plea of guilty (Tr. at 7, 10). We would note that, despite the availability of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attack, the respondent’s 2006 conviction is final for immigration purposes unless and until it has been formally overturned. See Matter of Onyido, 22 I&N Dec. 552 (BIA 1999). Moreover, we note that the respondent has provided no indication that his conviction has been overturned, and there is no objective documentation in the record suggesting that a post-conviction application attacking this conviction was even filed.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Osberg-Braun, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; remand
 
This matter was last before the Board on March 19, 2007. At that time, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s November 15, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s request for a continuance. The respondent thereafter filed a timely motion to reconsider, reopen, and remand the matter. The motion will be denied.
 
Although the respondent previously stated on appeal that the Immigration Judge “never gave him the opportunity to request Cancellation of Removal” (Respondent’s Appellate Br. at 3) — a contention that we rejected on appeal as the respondent never requested such relief before the Immigration Judge (Board’s March 19, 2007, decision at 1) — he now concedes that he did not previously request relief in the form of cancellation of removal (Respondent’s Motion at 2). However, he alleges that his attorney’s failure to raise such a claim constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Motion at 2).
 
First, with respect to his motion to reconsider, the respondent fails to specify an error of law or fact in our previous decision. Specifically, we find no new legal argument or an aspect of the case which was overlooked in our prior decision. Second, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that a reopening is warranted here given that he has not shown that the proffered evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the respondent alleges that he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal (Respondent’s Motion at 2), he has not shown that such evidence was previously unavailable.
 
Furthermore, considering the respondent’s argument of suffering ineffective assistance by his former attorney, we do not find that the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º
 
Thus, based on the evidence before us, we find that the respondent was not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard given that he was afforded a fair hearing before the Immigration Judge and given ample opportunities to present evidence toward his applications for relief. We therefore see no basis to remand the matter. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992) (stating that we ordinarily will not consider a discretionary grant of a motion to remand unless the moving party presents evidence of such a nature that we are satisfied that the new evidence would likely change the outcome of the case). To the extent that the respondent insinuates that his failure to seek cancellation of removal was a result of the Immigration Judge’s mishandling of the case (Respondent’s Motion at 2-3), we note that the respondent has the burden in these proceedings to demonstrate eligibility for relief. Finally, we find that the circumstances presented in the respondent’s motion are not “exceptional” as to justify a sua sponte reopening of the matter. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s motions will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

We have held that a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In addition to complying with the procedural requirements, a respondent must also show that “he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance.” See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On January 23, 2006, an Immigration Judge issued an interim order granting the Department of Homeland Security’s motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal for permanent residents because he was convicted of an aggravated felony drug crime. On May 18, 2006, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico.¿FN1º The respondent has filed an appeal, and a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes both. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent asserts that his counsel before the Immigration Judge was ineffective because she failed to submit a brief in response to the DHS’ motion to pretermit. As explained in the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 23, 2006, the respondent was convicted in California for possession with intent to sell marijuana, and this fits the definition of an aggravated felony drug crime which bars the respondent from cancellation. The respondent has not indicated what arguments his attorney could have presented in response to the motion which would have provided the Immigration Judge with any grounds to deny the DHS’ motion to pretermit. We see no “plausible grounds” for finding that the respondent could establish eligibility for cancellation of removal in light of his conviction. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 589 (9th Cir. 2006). Due to the absence of any prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s request for reopening must be denied.¿FN2º See generally Mohessini Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir. 1986).
 
In his motion, the respondent indicates that he will seek modification of his conviction in the criminal court (see Respondent’s declaration, July 18, 2006). This indicates that the respondent might benefit from a delay in the proceedings, but does not support the merits of his current motion to reopen. Insofar as the respondent suggests that he was prejudiced because he is now deprived of a written record upon which to appeal the case, we respond that the absence of a reply brief to the motion to pretermit does not preclude him from presenting substantive arguments to establish the element of prejudice for purposes of reopening.
 
*2 We conclude that the appeal should be dismissed, and the motion to reopen denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The record contains a summary order issued on this date, but it does not appear that a separate oral or written decision was issued (see Tr. at 18-20). This usually serves as a reason to remand the record. See Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). In this case, however, the Immigration Judge issued a detailed interim order about the issue on appeal, the finding of removability was made on the record and has not been challenged (Tr. at 12), and the respondent does not argue that the final order is procedurally insufficient. In this situation, we will not remand for the issuance of a separate oral or written decision, but remind the Immigration Judge to issue such orders in the future.

We accordingly need not determine whether the respondent submitted sufficient evidence to establish in fact that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hector R. Ortega, Esquire
*1 The respondent, who is a native of Mexico, filed a motion to reopen on April 5, 2007. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on May 12, 1999. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion was therefore filed out of time. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion. Although the motion is untimely, the Board will reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent was convicted on June 10, 1997, in California of assault with a deadly weapon, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 365 days. The respondent was charged with being subject to removal under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as someone convicted of an aggravated felony. The Board agreed in its May 12, 1999, decision, that the respondent was found guilty of “a crime of violence…” where the term of imprisonment is at least one year. Section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act.
 
The respondent argues that his conviction is no longer an aggravated felony. He presents evidence that, on January 30, 1998, the sentence in his criminal conviction was reduced to 364 days. In Matter of Cota-Vargas, 23 I&N Dec. 849 (BIA 2005), the Board found that a trial court’s decision to modify or reduce an alien’s criminal sentence nunc pro tunc is entitled to full faith and credit by the Immigration Judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals, and such a modified or reduced sentence is recognized as valid for purposes of the immigration law without regard to the trial court’s reasons for effecting the modification or reduction. The California court’s January 30, 1998, order reducing the previously imposed criminal sentence from 365 days to 364 clays of incarceration is entitled to full faith and credit. The respondent’s conviction for assault resulted in a sentence of 364 days of incarceration or less than 1 year; therefore, the respondent’s conviction is not an aggravated felony. See Sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act.
 
The respondent is currently in Mexico, having been removed from the United States in 1999, and 2006 (Respondent’s Mot.). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ordered that a motion may be filed subsequent to a respondent’s removal, where a conviction has been vacated. See Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2006). Additionally, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his attorney, who failed to inform the Board about the change in his sentence, prior to the Board’s decision dismissing his appeal.
 
*2 Inasmuch as the respondent cannot be viewed as subject to removal from the United States based upon the charge contained in the Notice to Appear that was affirmed by the Immigration Judge and Board, the case will be reopened and proceedings terminated.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision of May 12, 1999, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Removal proceedings against the respondent are terminated.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Susan R. Smolens, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; continuance
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s March 22, 2007, decision finding him removable as charged and denying his request for a continuance to seek post-conviction relief is dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1997 (Exh. 1). On May 31, 2006, the respondent was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, in and for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for the offenses of aggravated assault and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault in violation of Title 18 Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes sections 2702(a)(4) and 903(a)(1), respectively (Exh. 2). For his aggravated assault conviction, the respondent was sentenced to a minimum of 11 1/2 months and maximum 23 months’ incarceration and for his conspiracy conviction, the respondent was sentenced to 5 years’ probation (Exh. 2). Based upon his conviction, the respondent was placed into the instant proceedings with the issuance of the Notice to Appear on June 12, 2006 (Exh. 1). During his proceedings, the respondent contested his removability as charged and requested a continuance to seek post-conviction relief.
 
In his March 22, 2007, decision, the Immigration Judge tersely found the respondent’s conviction to be one for a “crime of violence” and, thus, an aggravated felony as that term is defined in section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) (I.J. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for a continuance noting the amount of time the respondent had been given to prepare his case and the speculative nature of the outcome of his conviction-related proceeding (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent disputes the Immigration Judge’s finding that his conviction is one for an aggravated felony. See Respondent’s Brief at 17-20. The respondent also alleges that the Immigration Judge inappropriately relied upon the police report to find his conviction to be one for a crime of violence and that the Immigration Judge erred in finding him removable where the Notice to Appear does not clearly state the charges levied against him. Id. at 7-10. Finally, the respondent argues that his continuance should have been granted so that he may seek post-conviction relief because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings. Id. at 12-13. In this regard, the respondent avers that his sentence will be reduced. Id. at 16-17.
 
*2 The statute under which the respondent was convicted encompasses a variety of different crimes and consequently is a divisible statute. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has concluded that in cases where the statute of conviction is disjunctive and, therefore, reaches both conduct that would constitute an aggravated felony and conduct that would not, the court may conduct an examination of the charging papers in the record of conviction to determine if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the alien was convicted of the elements of the defined crime. See Garcia v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 287 (3d Cir. 2006); Matter of Sweetser, 22 I&N Dec. 709 (BIA 1999); see also Singh v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 144 (3d Cir. 2004). The Third Circuit has also held that recklessness is not sufficient mens rea for an aggravated felony. See Popal v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 249 (3d Cir. 2005) (dealing with simple assault conviction).
 
Under these circumstances, we consider whether the documentation or other judicially noticeable facts in the record indicate that the respondent was convicted of a crime of violence. In this case, we find that the judicially noticeable documents support the finding that the respondent was so convicted (Exh. 2). In this regard, the plea colloquy contained in the record indicates that the respondent pled guilty to the offense of aggravated assault under Title 18 Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes section 2702(a)(4) (Exh. 2).¿FN1º According to 18 P.C.S. § 2702(a)(4), “¿aº person is guilty of aggravated assault if he… attempts to cause or intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon.” The offense is a Second-degree felony and requires attempted or intentional or knowing bodily injury to a designated person or with a deadly weapon; reckless actions are not included. 18 P.C.S. §§ 2702(a) and (b). The plea colloquy indicates that the respondent pled guilty to a violation of this section with the use of a deadly weapon (Exh. 2). Therefore, the respondent pled guilty to a crime which is a crime of violence and aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act.
 
Moreover, allegations of error or a request for collateral or post-conviction relief do not prevent a conviction from being final for immigration purposes unless relief is granted and we are without jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s appellate arguments in regard to the adequacy of his representation and/or any due process violations that occurred during his criminal proceedings. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323 (BIA 1996); Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); see also Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750, 751-52 (BIA 1993). Further, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion for a continuance pending the outcome of his post-conviction application for relief; it is not good cause to request a continuance to await the results of a collateral event which may occur at some uncertain, indefinite date in the future and the outcome of which may or may not be favorable to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R § 1003.29; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision whether to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing).
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We note that the Immigration Judge did not rely upon a police report to determine under which portion of the statute the respondent was convicted. Further, we note that the Notice to Appear specifically charges the respondent with removability as an aggravated felon under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as that term is defined in section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act. Therefore, we find his appellate arguments regarding the alleged use of a police report and alleged insufficiency of the Notice to Appear to be baseless.

APPLICATION: Relief
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 2, 2007, finding the respondent removable based on his admissions (Tr. at 9-10) and record of conviction¿FN1º (Exh. 3); and ordering his removal to Jamaica, will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(c). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate contentions that he was denied constitutional due process, first by the Immigration Judge, and secondly, by his former counsel, based on allegations of ineffective assistance in the presentation of his case.
 
Initially, we find no support for the respondent’s claim that he was denied constitutional due process by the Immigration Judge. We have held an alien must demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by a violation of a procedural rule or regulation before his deportation proceeding will be invalidated. Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325, 329 (BIA 1980). This is consistent with the rule that an alien must have been prejudiced by a procedural defect in his deportation proceeding before he will be found to have suffered a denial of due process. See Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981). In the matter before us, no such prejudice has been shown. Moreover, the record reflects that the respondent had ample opportunity to prepare for and address the removal charges.
 
The respondent has also raised a claim of denial of due process premised on his allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5 th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). We note the respondent here has failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in Lozada, in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Notwithstanding, even if were to find the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, he must also establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorney’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra at 640. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, acknowledging that it “has never squarely held that an alien has ‘a constitutional right to effective counsel in removal proceedings,”’ nevertheless has stated that an “alien’s right to due process is violated when ‘the representation afforded ¿himº was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing,’ and, as a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice.” Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 fn.15 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 fn.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194, 198 (5th Cir.1975)) (internal citations omitted)). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra at 561. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998); see also Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir. 2004) (ineffective assistance of counsel may violate an alien’s right to due process under the Fifth Amendment if the “representation afforded ¿the alienº … was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.”).
 
The respondent has failed to demonstrate what actions his former attorney should have taken that would have warranted a different result and so as to demonstrate he was “prejudiced.” See e.g.,Dakane v. United States Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (Prejudice is shown where counsel’s actions is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s ineffectiveness, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different). The respondent’s contention that his former counsel should have objected to the documentary evidence establishing his 2002 New Jersey drug trafficking conviction (Exh. 3) is specious and unavailing, as there is no argument that he stands convicted of that offense and that it is final for immigration purposes. Moreover, we find no support for the respondent’s appellate argument that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance when she failed to argue that 2002 New Jersey drug trafficking conviction for which he was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, 54 month of which to be served without parole, was not an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). We find there is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence to suggest that his former counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair.
 
*3 Finally, with regard to the respondent’s appellate constitutional challenges, we note that this Board and the Immigration Judges lack the authority to consider constitutional challenges to the statutes and regulations we administer. See Matter of Fede, 20 I&N Dec. 35 (BIA 1989); see also Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988); Matter of Valdovinos, 18 I&N Dec. 343 (BIA 1982).
 
The respondent raises no other arguments on appeal which were not addressed by the Immigration Judge or which would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions¿FN2º and the conviction record (Exh. 3) submitted in this case. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229a(c)(3)(A). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was either statutorily eligible or warranted any relief from removal to which he may have been otherwise entitled.
 
Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the appeal is dismissed.

The record reflects the respondent was convicted on September 13, 2002, in the Superior Court - Law Division, Somerset County, New Jersey, of the offense of Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine, in violation of the New Jersey Statutes 2C:35-5a(a)/2C:35-5b(1), and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, 54 months of which to be served without parole (Exh. 3).

The respondent admitted that his 2002 New Jersey drug trafficking conviction is an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, at the hearing through his representative and conceded his removability (Tr. at 9-10). In addition, noting the respondent did not appear eligible for any relief from removal, his attorney made no applications for relief (Tr. at 11). Absent egregious circumstances, a concession made by counsel of record is binding upon the alien as an admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barton C. Winter, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ann M. Tanke
Acting Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 22, 2007, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him on September 12, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) urges affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Guatemala who entered the United States on or about October 3, 2005. In the motion to reopen filed before the Immigration Judge, the respondent asserted that he did not receive notice of the scheduled hearing. In addition, he claimed that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to enter an appearance in Immigration Court or assist him in maintaining his current address with the court, arguing that the deficient representation constituted exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear at his removal hearing.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded if the alien files a motion to reopen, within 180 days of the date of the order of removal, demonstrating that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, or at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
Despite the respondent’s claim that he did not receive notice of the removal hearing, we find that the respondent was properly served with notice of the removal hearing at his last known address. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c). The record reflects that the respondent was personally served the Notice to Appear on October 5, 2005 (Exh. 1). Thus, the respondent was informed in writing of his obligation to notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever he changed his address or telephone number during the course of proceedings, as well as of the consequences of his failure to notify. See Section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. The respondent also received oral notice in Spanish of the consequences of his failure to attend a removal hearing (Exh. 1). The record further reflects that the hearing notice was mailed to the address that the respondent provided to the DHS at the time of charging. While the respondent’s father stated in his supplemental affidavit in support of the respondent’s amended motion to reopen that he and the respondent moved to Minnesota in “January/February of 2006,” the respondent failed to file a change of address with the Immigration Court on form EOIR-33 as required by statute. See Section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. Thus, the hearing notice mailed to the respondent on March 10, 2006, at the last address supplied to the DHS, constituted sufficient service under the statute.
 
*2 Although the respondent also argues that exceptional circumstances existed for his failure to appear, those claims are untimely, as he did not raise them in a motion to reopen filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s September 12, 2006, decision.¿FN1º See section 240(b)(5)(c) of the Act see also Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dee. 140 (BIA 1998) and Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(e)(3)(A) of the Act).¿FN2º Nevertheless, we would also find that the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel that would constitute exceptional circumstances. Regardless of former counsel’s actions in failing to enter an appearanee or to instruct the respondent about his address reporting requirements, the respondent had the statutory responsibility to notify the Immigration Court of his change of address, and the record reflects that he received written notification of his statutory obligation. We thus find that the respondent has not demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel that eaused him to fail to appear for the September 12, 2006, heating. He therefore has not established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter ofA-A, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings pursuant to section 242B of the Act. However, as section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act sets forth identical language to that contained in section 242B(c)(3), we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, by analogy.

IN RE: WYNDHAM JAMES

August 6, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Albert Van Lare, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on October 3, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s June 29, 1999, decision denying his motion to terminate his proceedings. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen. The motion is denied.
 
Through his motion, the respondent, through new counsel, argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his proceedings before the Immigration Judge and the Board. In particular, the respondent asserts that his prior counsel failed to notify him of the June 29, 1999, removal order entered against him and told him that his case had been resolved favorably in 1998; filed an appeal with the Board without his authorization; failed to notify him of any court appearances beyond his original appearance in early 1998; and, failed to have any contact with him after 1998. The respondent asserts that he has complied with the Board’s requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although not specifically raised by the respondent, it appears that the respondent seeks to have the motions deadline equitably tolled under Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000).
 
Under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. At the outset, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra. In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id at 640.
 
Further, the Second Circuit has concluded that a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim occurs when “counsel’s performance impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause.” See Iavorski v. INS, supra quoting Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994). Such a deprivation of fundamental fairness is established when “(1) competent counsel would have acted otherwise, and (2) the alien was prejudiced by counsel’s performance.” Esposito v. 1NS, 987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir. 1993). It is only when these conditions are met, that the filing deadline for an untimely motion to reopen proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be equitably tolled. See id. at 108 (motion to reopen to permit filing of appeal based on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 In this case, we find that even if the respondent complied Matter of Lozada, supra, he has failed to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the evidence contained in the record. In this regard, we note that the respondent notified former counsel of his complaint and provided former counsel with an opportunity to respond. The respondent’s former counsel disputes the respondent’s claims and has provided evidence to support his position. In addition to the documentation submitted by former counsel in response to the respondent’s Lozada claim against him, we find that the independent evidence of record supports former counsel’s position that the respondent has misrepresented the events during his proceedings both before the Board and the Immigration Judge in order to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
First, the respondent’s claim that former counsel notified him in 1998 that his case had been resolved favorably is belied by the transcript contained in the record which shows that the respondent, represented by former counsel, was present and testified during his merits hearing on May 24, 1999 (Tr. at 30-37). This evidence also dispels the respondent’s contentions that he was not provided the opportunity to participate in his own proceedings, that he was not notified by former counsel of any court appearances after 1998, and that he had no contact with former counsel after 1998. It is disingenuous at best for the respondent to contend that he was informed of a favorable disposition of his case in 1998 by his attorney, that he was not notified of any court appearances after 1998, that he had no contact with his former counsel after 1998, and that he was unable to participate in his “defense” when the record clearly establishes that the respondent was present, represented by former counsel, and actively participated in the May 24, 1999, merits hearing (Tr. at 30-37). Moreover, the record contains a Notice of Appearance, Form EOIR-27, filed with the Board on July 28, 1999, in conjunction with the respondent’s appeal which has been duly executed by both the respondent and former counsel. This evidence contradicts the respondent’s claim that he was completely unaware that former counsel filed an appeal with the Board on his behalf. Under these circumstances, the respondent has failed to establish that the motions deadline applicable to his current motion should be equitably tolled.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

August 3, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Neil Taylor, Jr., Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s January 18, 2007, decision denying her motion to reconsider his November 17, 2006, decision denying her motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. On appeal the respondent, through counsel, cites Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in arguing she should not be penalized for her attorney’s mistake in having her come to his office on the day of his uncle’s funeral even though a motion to waive her presence at Immigration Court on that same day had not been granted. The respondent also cites Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999) in claiming the Immigration Judge incorrectly required her to demonstrate “exceptional circumstances” rather than “reasonable cause” for failing to appear at her scheduled hearing (Resp.’s Br. at 4-5). The Department of Homeland Security has not offered any response to the respondent’s appeal.
 
The respondent misstates the holdings in Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, and Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998), which discussed the timeliness of motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.¿FN1º As the respondent’s proceedings were initiated on March 23, 2006, with the issuance of the Notice to Appear, her proceedings are governed by section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), which requires a showing of exceptional circumstances, not “reasonable cause,” for failure to appear. Consequently, the Immigration Judge correctly applied the “exceptional circumstances” standard for the respondent’s failure to appear. We also note that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are not applicable in deportation proceedings. See Matter of Magana, 17 I&N Dec. 111 (BIA 1979). As such, the respondent’s arguments in this regard are unavailing.
 
However, we find it difficult to conceive a set of facts upon which a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was so clearly demonstrated as those which are presented before us.¿FN2º The respondent’s counsel has repeatedly admitted he knew his motion to waive the respondent’s appearance at her master calendar hearing had not yet been acted upon. Nonetheless he still had his client travel to his office rather than the Immigration Court as he had a funeral to attend that day, on the assumption that a favorable decision would be rendered. He predicated this assumption on the actions of another Immigration Judge in another Immigration Court, who allowed such waivers (Motion to Reconsider at 1). Counsel admittedly is new to the practice of immigration law, and essentially presented “common sense” and humanitarian arguments in his motions that had nothing to do with either the law, or Immigration Court practice (Motion to Reopen; Motion to Reconsider, tab A). In essence, he contended that as a close relative’s funeral was being held where his attendance was necessary, the Immigration Judge should have excused his telling his client, the respondent, not to appear in Immigration Court, but instead come to his office for a telephonic hearing, despite the fact that a decision had not been rendered on his motion. Such action, facially, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly cited our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra, in noting the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find such a claim is implicit in the respondent’s motion. However, as noted, we are hard-pressed to discern a situation in which ineffective assistance was so clearly presented. Rather, by his own account, counsel has repeatedly provided the respondent with inaccurate and/or incomplete assistance, both with regard to her appearance at court, and in the filing of her motion to reopen. Given the highly unusual situation presented, we find that the concerns addressed by the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied in the instant situation. Counsel clearly admits his deficient service, has had an opportunity to address the same, his errors occurred in the course of representation he clearly agreed to perform, and the respondent was unquestionably prejudiced as a result of his advice. Id. While the requirement that a bar complaint be filed has not been complied with, we shall refer this case to the EOIR Office of General Counsel for review, thus addressing all of the concerns expressed in Matter of Lozada.
 
In sum, we find the respondent was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, she has demonstrated exceptional circumstances excusing her failure to appear for her October 10, 2006, hearing. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s October 10, 2006, and November 17, 2006, decisions are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s October 17, 2006, motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

Section 242(b) applies when service of the notice of hearing is made prior to June 13, 1992. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Here, proceedings were initiated in 2006 (Exh. 1). As such, the cases cited by the respondent are inapplicable to her case.

We assume the same thought came to the Immigration Judge, as he outlined the requirements for such a claim as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in his denial of the motion to reopen. The fact that counsel chose to ignore this suggestion supports rather than undermines the inference of ineffective assistance of counsel.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joyce Bakke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of an aggravated felony
 
Lodged: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; Termination; Section 212(c) Waiver
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals an Immigration Judge’s March 1, 2007, decision granting the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) motion to rescind an order granting the respondent’s September 22, 2006, motion to reopen the instant deportation proceedings. In addition, a motion to reopen filed by the respondent on March 23, 2007, and supplemented by a filing on May 4, 2007, is currently before the Board. The appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.
 
On January 1, 1998, the Immigration Judge found the respondent deportable under former section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent was convicted on July 21, 1994, of the offense of transportation/sale of a narcotic substance, to wit: cocaine, in violation of California Health and Safety Code § 11352 (I.J. at 2 (1/13/98)). The Immigration Judge further found that the respondent was ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), pursuant to Matter of Soriano, 21 I&N Dec. 516, 533 (A.G. 1997). The respondent did not appeal this decision and was physically removed from the United States in 1998 pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
Five years later, on January 24, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court, arguing that the Immigration Judge: (1) erroneously concluded that his 1994 criminal conviction involved an aggravated felony; (2) failed to inform him of his right to seek a section 212(c) waiver; and (3) led him to believe that it would be futile to file an appeal. The Immigration Judge denied this motion on March 17, 2003, finding that it was untimely, as it was filed well over 90 days after the January 13, 1998, entry of the final administrative order (I.J. at 2 (3/17/03)). The Immigration Judge further found that his prior decision was in accord with the law and facts at the time, and that he properly advised the respondent of his right to appeal (I.J. at 2 (3/17/03)). On November 25, 2003, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of this decision on the merits and further rejected an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which the respondent had raised for the first time in the appeal. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We noted in our decision that the respondent’s motion was also barred because it was filed after his physical departure from the United States under a final order of deportation—an act that brought the deportation proceedings to a close. See Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864, 865 (BIA 1994).
 
*2 On September 22, 2006, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. The respondent noted that after reentering the United States illegally in 2001, he was arrested and indicted for violating 8 U.S.C. § 1326, and sentenced to serve 77 months of imprisonment after the entrance of a conditional guilty plea. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the respondent argued that the 8 U.S.C. § 1326 charge should be dismissed because the January 13, 1998, deportation order was issued in violation of his due process rights. The counsel for the Government in the criminal appellate proceedings agreed and filed an unopposed motion for remand to the District Court, which the Ninth Circuit granted, asserting that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that the respondent’s 1994 conviction was an aggravated felony without employing the modified categorical approach. See United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, 247 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir. 2001). In the second motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Court, the respondent argued that reopening was appropriate under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, because of material changes in the law and because his deportation order amounted to a deprivation of due process. The Immigration Judge granted this motion on September 28, 2006.
 
However, in a decision issued on March 1, 2007, which is the subject of the instant appeal, the Immigration Judge granted the DHS’s motion to rescind his order granting reopening. In pertinent part, the governing regulations provide that an Immigration Judge may reopen any case in which he has rendered a decision, “unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Furthermore, the Board has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of Immigration Judges in deportation cases. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(2). Additionally, a request to reopen a case in which a decision has been made by the Board, which is made by the party affected by the decision, must be in the form of a written motion to the Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)(1). Based on this authority, we agree with the Immigration Judge that jurisdiction became vested with the Board on June 13, 2003, when the respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of his January 24, 2003, motion to reopen (I.J. at 5 (3/1/07)). The cases cited by the respondent-Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974), and Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 156 (BIA 1998)—are distinguishable because they involved situations in which the Board permitted the filing of a motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge after dismissing an appeal of an earlier decision issued by the Immigration Judge for lack of jurisdiction (I.J. at 5 (3/1/07)). On the contrary, on November 25, 2003, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s January 24, 2003, motion to reopen on the merits (I.J. at 5 (3/1/07)). Therefore, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s March 1, 2007, decision and the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
*3 Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen filed with the Board, we note that he is seeking to have the January 13, 1998, deportation order vacated and the proceedings terminated, or in the alternative, to be allowed to pursue section 212(c) relief in subsequent proceedings. The respondent claims that there is a basis in law for reopening these deportation proceedings, despite the fact that he physically departed from the United States pursuant to an order of deportation in 1998. Specifically, he argues that he is entitled to benefit from material changes in the law effectuated by Rivera-Sanchez, supra, and United States v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). He further claims that he has experienced a denial of due process, which is an extraordinary circumstance warranting sua sponte reopening. In immigration proceedings, however, collateral attack on an executed order of removal is warranted only when that order resulted in a “gross miscarriage of justice.” Matter of La Grotta, 14 I&N Dec. 110, 111-12 (BIA 1972). Furthermore, such a gross miscarriage of justice exists only when it can be conclusively determined, upon the basis of then-existing judicial and administrative decisions, that the prior finding of deportability was not in conformity with the law as interpreted at the time the order was entered and executed. Hernandez-Almanza v. INS, 547 F.2d 100, 102-03 (9th Cir. 1976); Matter of Farinas, 12 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 1967); Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730 (BIA 1966). With these principles in mind, we conclude that the respondent’s 1998 deportation order is not susceptible to collateral attack in these proceedings.
 
At the time of the respondent’s deportation in 1998, aliens in deportation proceedings who had been convicted of aggravated felonies were deemed to be categorically ineligible for section 212(c) relief. See Matter of Soriano, supra, at 533-40. While the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court ultimately overruled the rationale of Matter of Soriano, those decisions were not issued until 1999 and 2001, respectively, well after the respondent’s deportation occurred (I.J. at 2, (3/1/07)). See St. Cyr, supra; Magana-Pizano v. INS, 200 F.3d 603 (9th Cir. 1999). Likewise, the Ninth Circuit had not yet adopted the framework requiring the application of the modified categorical approach to divisible statutes when determining removability in aggravated felony cases. See, e.g., Rivera-Sanchez, supra. Because the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 1998, determination that the respondent was deportable and ineligible for section 212(c) relief was in conformity with the law as interpreted at the time, we cannot find that the deportation order resulted in a “gross miscarriage of justice,” such that it is subject to collateral attack in the instant proceedings. Ramirez-Juarez v. INS, 622 F.2d 174, 175-76 (9th Cir. 1980); see also Robledo-Gonzales v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 667, 682 n. 13 (7th Cir. 2003). Specifically, the respondent’s 1998 deportation order is not invalidated simply because the law may have changed subsequent to the issuance of that order. Ramirez-Juarez, supra; see also Alvarenga-Villalobos v. Ashcroft, 271 F.3d 1169, 1172-73 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that a removal order that. was lawful when executed is not invalidated by subsequent changes in law) (citing Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 307-08 (1989)). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent’s 1998 deportation order did not violate his due process rights.¿FN1º
 
*4 Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Furthermore, we find that the cases cited by the respondent with respect to the “gross miscarriage of justice” issue are distinguishable. Unlike the scenarios in those cases, the respondent’s 1994 conviction for transportation/sale of a narcotic substance has not been vacated. See Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2006); Estrada-Rosales v. INS, 645 F.2d 819 (9th Cir. 1981).

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on May 3, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our February 6, 2006, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision finding her removable, and denying her application for adjustment of status. The respondent appealed our decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In an order issued January 24, 2007, the court granted the respondent’s unopposed motion to remand proceedings.
 
In the motion to remand the respondent contended the Board neglected to address the claim in her motion to reconsider that a remand was warranted as she was eligible for cancellation of removal. On remand the respondent newly alleges in a brief that she, in fact, did seek cancellation of removal during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge (Remand Br. at 3). The respondent avers the Immigration Judge and this Board erred by “ignor¿ingº her requests” for cancellation of removal, and failing to address her eligibility for such relief (Remand Br. at 7).¿FN1º She also maintains the Immigration Judge should have considered her eligibility for cancellation after determining she was ineligible for adjustment of status (Remand Br. at 8).
 
The respondent’s above-noted arguments contain misstatements of fact. During the proceedings below the respondent did initially indicate she wished to seek cancellation of removal in addition to adjustment of status (Tr. at 2). The Immigration Judge granted her a continuance of more than 11 months in which to submit any applications for relief, specifically referencing a cancellation application (Tr. at 3-4). However, when the hearing reconvened, the respondent indicated the only relief she intended to pursue was adjustment of status with a waiver of inadmissibility (Tr. at 7-10). To that end, the sole application for relief submitted by the respondent was for adjustment of status (Exhs. 2-3).¿FN2º Contrary to the arguments in her brief on remand, the respondent neither expressed any desire to pursue an application for cancellation of removal, nor did she submit the requisite application for such relief within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge. As such, she waived her opportunity to pursue an application for cancellation of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (stating that an Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications, and that if an application is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived). Accordingly, we find no error in this regard.
 
*2 For the respondent’s benefit, we observe that her subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision by counsel is not grounds to reopen unless she can show counsel behaved so egregiously that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B- et al., 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998) (finding no ineffective assistance of counsel where the attorney’s insistence on corroborating evidence discouraged the aliens from applying for asylum), citing Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (absent a showing of egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney is binding on the alien). Here, the respondent has not alleged, much less established, she had ineffective assistance of counsel during the proceedings below. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Given these facts, we find no merit to her argument the Immigration Judge erred in not addressing her eligibility for cancellation of removal after her claim for adjustment failed. Absent showing that her counsel engaged in egregious conduct as noted, she cannot now recant her decision to pursue only one form of relief. Id. Therefore, we find no merit to these allegations of error.
 
In her brief on remand the respondent states she is currently pregnant with a United States citizen child, and asks that her case therefore be reopened for consideration of an application for cancellation of removal (Remand Br. at 11-13). This assertion is in the nature of a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). However, it is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board decision she seeks to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent has not contended that her pregnancy constitutes an exception to this deadline, nor do we otherwise find as such. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). We also do not find that her pregnancy constitutes an exceptional circumstance exempting her from the time requirements for motions to reopen. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board retains limited discretionary power under the regulations to reopen or reconsider only in exceptional circumstances). Therefore, reopening in this regard is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

1

The respondent contends it was “fundamentally unfair” for the Immigration Judge to find her ineligible for adjustment of status and conclude proceedings as the DHS had filed a new charge of removability against her only seven days before the hearing (Remand Br. at 8). However, the respondent neither raised this claim on appeal, nor was this part of the Circuit Court remand. As such, we do not find that this claim is properly before us. Moreover, this argument is in the nature of a motion to reconsider, and is untimely as it was filed more than 30 days after the Board decision she seeks to have reconsidered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Therefore, reconsideration is not appropriate.

2

We note in neither her Notice of Appeal nor her appeal brief before the Board did the respondent contend she had presented a claim for cancellation that the Immigration Judge neglected to address. Thus, this issue was never presented before the Board, and we did not err in failing to address it in our initial decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Princy Sethi, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present in the United States without being admitted or paroled
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of March 15, 2006, that denied his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (hereinafter “Act”). The appeal will be dismissed. The request for oral argument before the Board is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(e).
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the applicant, a legal permanent resident, had been convicted of multiple crimes involving moral turpitude and, as the respondent had failed to report for a deferred inspection, was presently in the United States without being admitted or paroled and, therefore, he was removable from the United States. See I.J. at 7-9. The Immigration Judge further determined that as a matter of discretion, after balancing the positive and negative factors, cancellation of removal was not warranted. See I.J. at 9-14. See also Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998) (ruling that in exercising discretion under section 240A(a) an Immigration Judge must review the record as a whole to balance the adverse factors of undesirability with social and humane considerations.)
 
Regarding the crimes involving moral turpitude, the respondent argues that he was only convicted of one crime for theft (shoplifting) under section 609.52 of the Minnesota Statutes, which is considered a misdemeanor. See Matter of Jurado, 24 I&N Dec. 29 (BIA 2006) (holding that retail theft is a crime involving moral turpitude.) While the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had admitted under oath to a second conviction for shoplifting in Pennsylvania, the respondent argues that his testimony on this offense did not amount to an admission of a conviction, but merely that he was arrested for this offense, and, therefore, he is admissible under the petty offense exception at section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). The record does not contain any court documentation of a conviction and we are forced to rely on the sworn testimony. During his testimony, the respondent admitted being arrested for a theft in Minnesota in 1989, for shoplifting in Pennsylvania in 1992, for assault in Missouri, and for theft and “execution of documents by deception” in Texas in January 2006. See Tr. at 43, 45, 48-50. We agree that the respondent clearly admitted to the conviction for theft in Minnesota, but the record reveals that when questioned about the other arrests he denied any convictions, and the Immigration Judge committed error in finding otherwise.¿FN1º As discussed by the Immigration Judge during the hearing and in his decision, the respondent, through his attorney, conceded the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). See I.J. at 3; Tr. at 2-3. However, the respondent’s attorney admitted in open court that this was a mistake, then appears to have made an oral motion to correct this mistake, and, although the Immigration Judge noted at the hearing and in his decision that the attorney’s concession amounted to ineffective assistance by counsel, the Immigration Judge refused to invoke the petty offense exception at section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) as he found the respondent had admitted to a second conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude (that is, shoplifting in Pennsylvania in 1992). See I.J. at 7-9; Tr. at 70-72. As the Immigration Judge clearly indicated that the respondent’s concession of the charge under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and erroneously determined that the respondent had admitted under oath to more than one conviction to a misdemeanor crime involving moral turpitude, we conclude that the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was ineligible for the petty offense exception is also clearly erroneous.
 
*2 However, even if respondent is not prohibited from admission under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), he is still removable under the charge at section 212(a)(6)(A)(i). The record reveals that the respondent attempted to reenter the United States on September 5, 2004, after a 10-day trip to Peru, but his inspection for admission was deferred apparently due to the suspicion that he was inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). See Tr. at 37, 39. See also section 101(a)(13) of the Act (“admission” and “admitted” means the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.) The respondent never reported for this deferred inspection and has not lawfully reentered the United States. See Tr. at 40-41. The respondent argues that the charge under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) is merely derivative of the section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) charge and his inspection would not have been deferred but for the latter charge. Regardless of the Department of Homeland Security’s (hereinafter “DHS”) reasons for deferring the respondent’s inspection, the respondent has acknowledged that he never reported for the scheduled inspection and he has conceded the charge.¿FN2º There have been no allegations that his attorney made this concession in error. Thus, the respondent is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) unless he can demonstrate that cancellation of this removal is warranted under section 240A(a).
 
The positive factors for cancellation of removal include the respondent legally entering the United States in 1979 and becoming a legal permanent resident in 1984. See Tr. at 24, 34. He has significant family ties in the United States to include his parents, siblings, wife, two biological children, and two adopted children. See Exh. 3(8-9); Tr. at 35. He also has maintained steady work with a car dealership for a substantial period and a lengthy history of paying his taxes. See Exh. 3(10); Tr. at 38, 46. The respondent also has significant economic ties to the United States, to include his career which pays him approximately $10,000.00 a month, a house worth approximately $280,000.00 with equity of approximately $60,000.00, and a bank account with $1,000.00 to $1,200.00 balance. See Tr. 38. His wife and youngest child appear to be not just emotionally attached to him, but also economically dependent on him as her small travel agency has yet to be profitable. See Tr. at 75. Mitigating his family ties to the United States is the fact that the respondent does not appear to have a close relationship with his parents or his oldest child, who did not provide any type of statement in support of the respondent and the respondent did not testify to any ongoing relationship with these individuals. In addition, his business ties to the United States appear to be mitigated by the charges surrounding his arrest in January 2006 that are in connection with his business practices in an automobile dealership. See Tr. at 45-46.
 
*3 However, the most troubling and significant unfavorable factor is the respondent’s repeated omissions, evasions, and fabrications connected with his cancellation of removal application and testimony. Prior to his testimony, the Immigration Judge gave the respondent the opportunity to amend his application, after which the respondent added his arrest in January 2006. See Tr. at 15. However, this action was only undertaken after counsel for DHS had confronted the respondent and his attorney with the arrest record prior to the hearing. See Tr. at 48. After amending the application, the respondent swore under oath that the contents were accurate and true. See Tr. at 17. However, it was clearly revealed during testimony that the information on the application was incorrect and that the respondent knew this at the time he attested to its truthfulness. On his application, the respondent claimed that he had only been married one time (to his current wife), that he had married his wife in December 2000, that he obtained his legal permanent residence status in connection with an amnesty program, and that he had only been arrested on two occasions in 1989 and again in 2006. See Exh. 2. However, his testimony revealed that he had previously been married to another woman, that he had married his current wife in December 1998, that he obtained his legal permanent residence status through his first marriage to a United States citizen, and that he in fact had been arrested on four different occasions, to include an arrest for shoplifting in 1992 and an arrest for assault. See Tr. at 35, 43, 45, 48-50, 54-56. The respondent acknowledged during his testimony that he had knowingly submitted an incorrect application and failed to make any explanation for his behavior. Id. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s criminal and arrest record, with the most recent arrest just months prior to his hearing, and due to the numerous omissions and fabrications on his cancellation application, for which he offered no adequate explanation, shows evidence of a lack of rehabilitation and a lack of credibility. We find that the respondent’s fabrications, omissions, and evasiveness while under oath is an unfavorable factor against the grant of cancellation of removal that far outweighs the positive factors in this case.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in giving an undue amount of weight to the issue of the inaccurate application, evidence of rehabilitation, and his credibility. We disagree. See Matter of A-S-, 21 I&N 1106 (BIA 1998) (ruling that the Board defers to an adverse credibility finding when the discrepancies and omissions described by the Immigration Judge are actually present, the discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the alien provided false or incredible evidence, and a convincing explanation for the discrepancies and omissions has not been provided by the alien.) The respondent claims that the inaccuracies on the application were corrected during testimony, but we find that this characterization is itself inaccurate as our review of the transcript shows that the respondent reluctantly acknowledged the inaccuracies and omissions on his application only after counsel for DHS confronted him with evidence that he had knowingly made false statements on the application and during his prior testimony. See Tr. at 47-48, 52-56. See also Matter of Jurado, supra. (ruling that unsworn falsification to authorities is a crime involving moral turpitude.) We also find that the Immigration Judge gave this unfavorable factor its appropriate weight as the respondent’s lack of credibility undercuts the veracity of his claims of favorable factors to include his rehabilitation, economic ties to the United States, and hardship incurred on him and his family if removed. See Matter of O-D-, 21 I&N Dec. 1079 (BIA 1998) (holding that an alien’s presentation of a counterfeit document, absent an explanation or rebuttal, indicates an overall lack of credibility regarding the entire claim.) In addition, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by not weighing the totality of the evidence. We disagree, as our review of the Immigration Judge’s March 2006 decision reveals that it includes consideration of all pertinent factors concerning cancellation of removal as discussed in Matter of C-V-T-, supra,
 
*4 Finally, the respondent claims that the DHS’s failure to submit a reply brief must be treated as its acquiescence with the respondent’s position on appeal. We find no merit in this argument as the DHS is not required to file a reply to the respondent’s appeal and its decision to not submit a reply brief in no way abrogates the respondent’s burden of proof in establishing that he meets the criteria for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.¿FN3º See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(c).
 
Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the negative factors outweigh the positive factors and, therefore, the respondent does not merit cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act as a matter of discretion. We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The pertinent testimony includes the following: Q. All right. In 1992, were you convicted of that crime? A. I don’t remember. I don’t think so, sir. Q. Where did that crime occur? A. (Indiscernible). Q. Pardon me? A. (Indiscernible.) I think it was (Indiscernible). Q. Well, did you plead quilty? Or not contest? A. No contest. I don’t remember, sir. (Indiscernible) it was no conviction. Q. Did you plead no contest? A. Yes, sir. See Tr. 63. We find this testimony is not a clear admission to a conviction for shoplifting in 1992 due to the fact of the multiple “indiscernibles” in the transcript and that the respondent does not appear to understand the meaning, or the legal the implications, of pleading “no contest.”

2

We note that during the hearing the respondent claimed that he did not, or could not, take time off from work for his delayed inspection as his employer did not look favorably on allowing absences. See Tr. at 40. However, the respondent had previously testified that he regularly took vacations abroad with his family. See Tr. at 39.

3

The respondent cites Rarogal v. INS, 42 F.3d 570 (9th Cir. 1994), for the proposition that where the government has the opportunity to concur with the Immigration Court’s findings and to file a brief in support of the Immigration Court’s decision or request for summary affirmance, the government’s silence should be considered as acquiescence with the position advanced by the respondent. The decision in the Rarogal case does not contain such a holding. The facts of Rarogal included government counsel, in open court, conceding the respondent’s rehabilitation from his criminal past and announcing that the government no longer opposed relief from deportation of the alien. Id. at 572. In the respondent’s case, the DHS has not conceded his rehabilitation, nor has the DHS changed its position on opposing cancellation of the respondent’s removal. Therefore, the holding in Rarogal has no bearing on the outcome of the current case.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on June 23, 2004, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s September 24, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered on June 9, 2003. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
On April 2, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion because it is time and number barred and the respondent has failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief from removal. The motion will be denied.
 
As the respondent was ordered removed in absentia, we must look to in absentia case law and statutes for guidance in this matter. In a deportation case, we found that an alien is not required to rescind his deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Section 240(b)(7) of the Act sets forth a similar limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a removal hearing, as follows:
Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and who, at the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 239(a), was provided oral notice, either in the alien’s native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)) to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section 240A, 240B, 245, 248, or 249 for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.
 
 
In this case, the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent, and he was provided oral notice in Spanish of the consequences of a failure to appear as provided in section 240(b)(7) of the Act (Exh. 1). Consequently, it appears that the respondent is ineligible to seek cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240(b)(7) of the Act.
 
Additionally, the motion will be denied because it was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
*2 The respondent has not provided any evidence that warrants rescission of the in absentia removal order entered June 9, 2003. In his motion, the respondent states that his prior attorney failed to file a motion to change venue. See Respondent’s Motion at 4. The record reveals that a motion to change venue was untimely filed with the Immigration Court. He also states the he lacked sufficient funds to travel to the June 9, 2003, removal hearing held in Harlingen, Texas. These generalized statements made by respondent’s counsel in the instant motion to reopen are insufficient to constitute an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent’s request for a change of venue is moot.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen proceedings and remand to the Immigration Judge for a hearing on his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). He bases the motion on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and has submitted evidence to show that he has Complied with the requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion.
 
The respondent has not alleged that the late filing of this motion was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and it is denied as untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Moreover, we find that the prejudice required to establish ineffective assistance of counsel has not been shown. See Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that alien must demonstrate prejudice from counsel’s ineffective assistance in order to succeed on a due process challenge to an order entered in deportation proceedings); see also Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that the ineffective assistance must have been so fundamentally unfair that alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case). The respondent does not assert that he is not removable. He claims instead that the evidence to show his removability is not clear and convincing. We disagree. The documentary evidence in the record showing three drug possession convictions and the respondent’s admission that he was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and served 16 months (Tr. at 5) are sufficient to show that he is removable as charged.
 
With respect to the relief of cancellation of removal, the respondent has not shown that he is not barred from relief as an aggravated felon. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mayra Joli, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 22, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand.
 
On May 2, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. He also premises his motion on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the totality of the circumstances presented in this case, we will reopen these proceedings on our own motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997): The respondent’s motion is supported by evidence that establishes his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(a). See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 252 (BIA 2002) (allowing reopening of proceedings where a visa petition based on a marriage during proceedings was already pending and there was completed adjustment application supported by clear and convincing evidence of the bona fides of the marriage).
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(C), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C)º - Convicted of firearms or destructive device violation
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2007, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge, inter alia, denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), as a matter of discretion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of facts by an Immigration Judge, including those as to the credibility of testimony, to determine whether the findings are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).¿FN1º The Board may review all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues on appeal from decisions of the Immigration Judge “de novo.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(iii).
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica who entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1982, contends that he did not receive a fair hearing as the Immigration Judge was biased. He asserts that his 1999 conviction for criminal possession of a weapon was not valid as he received ineffective assistance of counsel and the police lied, and that the Immigration Judge erred by improperly weighing the equities in denying his application for cancellation as a matter of discretion. We disagree. We first note that the respondent cites to no specific instance, series of events, or any conduct or action by the Immigration Judge which suggests that the Immigration Judge acted in any way improperly or failed to conduct the respondent’s hearing in a proper and impartial manner. Accordingly, there has been no showing that the respondent’s hearing was not fairly conducted.
 
The respondent insists that his 1999 conviction for criminal possession of a weapon is not valid. Despite the availability of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attack, such as where there has been ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s conviction is final for immigration purposes unless and until it has been formally overturned. See Matter of Onyido, 22 I&N Dec. 552 (BIA 1999). The respondent has provided no indication that his conviction has been overturned. Consequently, the respondent remains an alien convicted of criminal possession of a weapon.
 
Turning to the underlying issue on appeal, the respondent, who was 8 years old when he entered the United States in 1982, has had no contact with family members in the United States for some 7 to 8 years, is single with no children, and has no assets, argues on appeal that he wants to remain in the United States. He had previously been employed at a car wash and as a bus driver, had received the equivalent of a high school education, had been of assistance to an elderly neighbor for several years, and does not use drugs; all of these factors were considered by the Immigration Judge in denying his application for cancellation as a matter of discretion, and on appeal, the respondent did not dispute any factual findings made by the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge considered all of the favorable factors, individually and cumulatively. Nonetheless, the Immigration Judge concluded that the serious adverse factors of record, including the respondent’s 1999 convictions for attempted assault, menacing, and criminal possession of a weapon; his 2000 arrest for impersonating a police officer, trespass, and criminal possession of a weapon; and his 2005 conviction for criminal possession of a weapon, all crimes for which the respondent insists he was wrongfully charged, outweighed those favorable factors. After fully considering and weighing all of the favorable and adverse factors of record, we agree with the Immigration Judge that relief was not warranted in the exercise of discretion; we therefore affirm the decision for the reasons stated therein. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s March 19, 2007, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, as untimely.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, was ordered removed from the United States by an Immigration Judge on October 20, 2006, and the respondent waived appeal of that order. On January 19, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. She contends, through counsel, that, although the motion was untimely, the 90-day Statutory deadline on filing motions to reopen should be equitably tolled in her case in view of her belief that she received ineffective assistance of counsel; she asserts that she accepted voluntary departure after being misinformed by previous counsel that she was barred from self-petitioning for adjustment of status, as a battered spouse, by reason of a lack of good moral character. The Immigration Judge concluded that, while the 90 day deadline is inapplicable where (1) the basis of the motion is to petition for relief as a battered spouse, (2) the motion is accompanied by a copy of the self-petition or cancellation of removal application, (3) the motion is filed within 1 year of the entry of the final order of removal, and (4) the alien is physically present in the United States when the motion is filed, the respondent’s motion contained neither a cancellation of removal application nor a copy of a self-petition. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iv). The Immigration Judge further concluded that, with respect to her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent had not met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond, and, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had not been prejudiced as she was, in fact, ineligible to seek a waiver of her visa fraud conviction under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), so as to establish good moral character.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent reiterates her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, indicating that, as she first learned on December 20, 2006, that her previous counsel had erred, equitable tolling was appropriate. She also argues that the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion was erroneous by failing to allow her to self-petition pursuant to section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act, as she had not received a copy of her self petition (I-360) from her previous counsel.
 
We find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. An alien seeking reopening of a removal order must file the required motion within 90 days after the entry of the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23 (b)(1). The respondent did not comply with this requirement, and therefore her motion was properly dismissed as untimely. As to the respondent’s invocation of the equitable tolling doctrine, she provides no explanation as to why, having learned, on December 20, 2006, of the alleged misadvice by previous counsel, she was unable to file her motion in a timely fashion, by Thursday, January 18, 2007. While the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held that the time for filing a motion to reopen can be equitably tolled, they declined to do so where, as here, no explanation for the failure to file the motion to reopen with the 90 day deadline is offered. See Harchenko v. INS, 379 F.3d 405, 409-410 (6th Cir. 2004). Furthermore, while the Immigration Judge may waive the 1 year filing deadline to reopen proceedings pursuant to section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv), where there is a showing of exceptional circumstances, the statute requires, without exception, that the motion be accompanied by either a cancellation of removal application or a copy of the self-petition that has been or will be filed with Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Orville McKenzie, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jill Tavlin Swartz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand; termination
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. Upon review of the record of proceedings, we adopt and affirm the February 28, 2006, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s request for a continuance and ordering him removed to Jamaica. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The respondent asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because former counsel failed to file an application for cancellation of removal prior to his withdrawal from representation. The respondent’s former counsel has filed a response that persuasively contests the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance, and indicates that the respondent failed to adequately cooperate with counsel in his representation. We find that the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Moreover, even assuming ineffective assistance of former counsel, we find that the respondent did not act diligently in pursuing his claims for relief. The record indicates that the respondent was given until July 6, 2004, to file an application for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 7-8). The application was not filed by this deadline. On August 3, 2005, the Immigration Judge granted former counsel’s motion to withdraw from representation. In granting the motion the Immigration Judge stated, “¿tºhe respondent should seek new counsel as soon as possible if he wishes to be represented at the ¿February 28, 2006º merits hearing.” Despite this warning, the respondent waited to obtain new counsel until the day before the February 28, 2006 hearing (Respondent’s Motion for Continuance, dated February 27, 2006). At the February 28, 2006 merits hearing, the Immigration Judge denied counsel’s request for a continuance and indicated that although the respondent missed the July 6, 2004 deadline, he “could have even filed ¿the applicationº ten days before this hearing” (Tr. at 12). We find the respondent’s delay in obtaining new counsel unreasonable under the circumstances. His lack of diligence indicates that reopening is not warranted as a matter of discretion.
 
Further, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a continuance. A party seeking a continuance has the burden of establishing good cause. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448, at 450 (1992); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). In determining whether an alien has demonstrated “good cause,” an Immigration Judge has broad discretionary authority. See, e.g., Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra. As discussed above, the respondent failed to diligently pursue his claims for relief. Thus, we cannot find that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion in denying the continuance.
 
*2 During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss proceedings. In support of his motion, the respondent submitted evidence indicating that his October 21, 1996, conviction for burglary and grand theft has been vacated. We have held that if a court vacates an alien’s conviction solely to allow an alien to avoid immigration hardships, the conviction would not be eliminated for immigration purposes. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003); see also Ali v. U.S. Atty Gen., 443 F.3d 804 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding that a conviction was not vacated on the basis of a substantive or procedural defect simply because a motion for new trial was granted). Although counsel for the respondent argues that the conviction was vacated for procedural and substantive defects,¿FN1º the evidence submitted by the respondent does not identify the basis upon which he sought to vacate the conviction, nor do the orders from the criminal court identify the basis. As the respondent has failed to establish the basis upon which the court vacated his conviction, such conviction remains for immigration purposes. See Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra, at 813 (upholding the Board’s determination that the alien has the burden of proving that his conviction had been vacated because of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings); see also, e.g., Rumierz v. Gonzales, 456 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2001) (upholding the Board’s determination that an alien bears the burden of proving that he has met the standards under Matter of Pickering, supra).
 
Accordingly, in view of the above, the appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.

*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on January 18, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding her subject to removal as charged. In that decision we stated our agreement with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), because she did not have the 5-year period of lawful permanent residence required by section 240A(a)(1) of the Act.¿FN1º The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent alleges that her former counsel failed to file an application for cancellation of removal on her behalf and failed to make the argument that the respondent met the requirement for cancellation of removal found at section 240A(a)(1) because her father’s lawful permanent resident status could be imputed to her. The respondent acknowledges that there was no controlling law supporting her argument of imputed lawful permanent resident status. However, she contends that it is a reasonable extension of Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that a parent’s period of continuous residence may be imputed to a child).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin with determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). Counsel’s actions must have rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair such that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting her case. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003). In addition, the alien must show that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra, at 973.
 
The respondent has failed to show ineffective assistance on the part of her former counsel. Former counsel’s failure to submit an application for cancellation of removal and support it with an argument as to imputed lawful permanent residence did not constitute deficient performance. At the time of the respondent’s hearing there was no controlling case law supporting the proposed argument. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for her former counsel to fail to make that argument. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690 (1984) (holding that in analyzing an ineffectiveness claim, it is proper to judge the reasonableness of counsel’s challenged conduct as of the time of that conduct). Moreover this Board has recently held that the argument proposed by the respondent is without merit. See Matter of Escobar, 24 I&N Dec. 231 (BIA 2007) (holding that a parent’s lawful permanent resident status cannot be imputed to a child for purposes of calculating the 5 years of lawful permanent residence required to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(1)).
 
*2 For these reasons, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edgardo Quintanilla, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela M. Fontova
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 28, 2007. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), in the exercise of discretion. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not considering the respondent’s alcoholism and drug abuse as a disease. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (e)(5). We find that the respondent’s arguments on appeal fail to establish error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent failed to establish that he warranted cancellation of removal in the exercise of discretion. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998) (finding that the Court “must balance the adverse factors evidencing the alien’s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented on his behalf to determine whether the granting of… relief appears in the best interest of this country.”). Although the respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have considered his alcoholism and drug abuse as a disease, we note that the respondent first raises this argument on appeal and has failed to establish that the documentary evidence submitted with his appellate brief to support this argument was not available and could not have been presented before the Immigration Judge. The Board does not consider evidence first offered on appeal as our review is a review of the record created before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Federenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Inasmuch as the respondent did not raise this argument before the Immigration Judge and the respondent has not established that the evidence submitted on appeal to support this argument is new and previously unavailable, we decline to consider the respondent’s argument. Furthermore, while the respondent contends that his prior counsel committed ineffective assistance by not raising such an argument before the Immigration Judge, we note that an attorney’s tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931,934 (9th Cir. 1986); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The decision of the respondent’s prior counsel to proceed on a different theory of the case does not establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Lastly, we find insufficient evidence to establish bias on the part of the Immigration Judge or a violation of the respondent’s due process rights. The portion of the transcript quoted in the respondent’s appellate brief does not indicate that the Immigration Judge improperly questioned the respondent or that the Immigration Judge exhibited bias in considering the evidence regarding the respondent’s alcohol and drug abuse.
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that the adverse factors of record, including his convictions for Use/Influence of a Controlled Substance, Theft, Burglary, Driving Under the Influence, Driving with a Suspended License, and Lewd Conduct, outweighed the favorable factors of record. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the best interests of this country would not be served by granting cancellation of removal to the respondent. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581,.584 (BIA 1978). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on November 22, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely. The respondent seeks reopening and remand to pursue her adjustment of status application. The respondent also appears to assert ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The respondent’s motion is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely and exceeds the number of motions to reopen permitted under the regulations. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent appears to acknowledge this, as she argues that the Board should take jurisdiction over the motion under our sua sponte authority in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). As noted by the respondent, the Board retains limited authority to reopen cases sua sponte, but this authority is only used in exceptional circumstances. This case does not present exceptional circumstances. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on July 31, 2000. The respondent did not seek to rescind the in absentia order until January 3, 2003. The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2003 denial of that motion on November 28, 2003. The respondent then waited two years to file a motion to reopen, filing on August 22, 2005. The Board denied that motion in November 22, 2005. Waiting another 1 1/2 years, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen. The respondent has not exercised due diligence in pursuing her claim. Furthermore, the respondent raised the issue of her counsel’s fault in her motion to rescind, and the Board addressed the claim in its decision. The respondent did not file a motion to reconsider. The fact that she is now eligible to adjust her status through the interim regulations does not change the fact that all of her motions have been untimely. Accordingly, we find the respondent does not present exceptional circumstances.
 
Equitable tolling of the time limits for motions to reopen is available to aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Diligence must be exercised, however. Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 2005) (diligence must be shown to toll motions deadline). The respondent claims that her attorney informed her that she did not need to appear at the hearing as she could participate in a telephonic hearing. As noted above, the respondent waited more than 2 1/2 years to assert this claim. She was notified immediately of the order, and took no action. Furthermore, this claim was asserted and addressed in the Board’s November 28, 2003, decision, and the respondent did not move to reconsider. Lastly, in the motion filed on August 22, 2005, the respondent did not raise ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that the respondent has not exercised due diligence, and the matter has been addressed previously, and is abandoned by the failure to raise it in the intervening motion.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oscar L. Amorow, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand; waiver of inadmissibility
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s November 29, 2005, decision insofar as her application for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), was denied. During the pendency of the appeal, she filed a motion asserting that she received ineffective assistance by her former attorney, Mr. Josselin Saint-Preux,¿FN1º regarding the preparation and presentation of her application for section 212(c) relief, and requesting that the record be remanded to permit her an opportunity to supplement the record regarding that application.
 
Regarding the motion, although the respondent asserts ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Mr. Saint-Preux, her motion fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for making such a claim. Attached to the motion is a brief letter from the respondent’s current attorney to Mr. Saint-Preux regarding the representation she received in conjunction with her section 212(c) application, but this is no substitute for an affidavit by the respondent herself of the type discussed in Matter of Lozada, supra. There also has been no showing that the respondent filed a complaint against Mr. Saint-Preux with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the claimed violations of his ethical or legal responsibilities, and she has not explained why she failed to do so. Id.
 
In her motion, she also asks for an opportunity to present additional evidence to support her section 212(c) application. However, she neither submitted nor sufficiently detailed the additional evidence of which she seeks consideration, and she has failed to persuasively explain how the consideration of additional evidence would alter the decision reached in her case. Accordingly, the motion to remand is denied.
 
Regarding the respondent’s appeal, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of section 212(c) relief in this case based on the record before her. Moreover, the appellate arguments being advanced do not persuade us to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, we adopt and affirm and adopt the Immigration Judge’s November 29, 2005, decision and dismiss the respondent’s appeal. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). The request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2007).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to remand is denied and the appeal is dismissed. The request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2007).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank T. Morell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher J. Reeber
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; cancellation of removal
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. She appeals an Immigration Judge’s March 22, 2006, decision finding her inadmissible to the United states under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i), denying her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and ordering her removed to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a response brief in support of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by considering whether the respondent, a returning lawful permanent resident of the United States, was inadmissible without first determining whether she had engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States. See section 101(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(iii). This argument is unpersuasive, as the Immigration Judge observed that the illegal activity in which the respondent had engaged was the very activity underlying the alien smuggling charge. See I.J. at 6; Exh. 1. Cf. United States v. Tsai, 282 F.3d 690, 696 n.5 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that the returning lawful permanent resident alien was properly regarded as seeking admission to the United States because he “ha¿dº engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States,” that being “the alien smuggling activity”). As the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had engaged in illegal activity after departing the United States, he properly found that she was subject to the grounds of inadmissibility enumerated at section 212 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182. See generally section 101(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the Act.
 
The respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in relying on evidence that had been entered into the record as a result of former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance. However, the respondent has neither substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor demonstrated a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 997-99 (9th Cir. 2006); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Cf. Exh. 27 (confirming that current counsel was substituted in as attorney of record on June 9, 2005); Tr. at 29, 134 (current counsel’s confirmation that the respondent had filed no objections to the DHS’s proffered evidence). See also Tr. at 30 (current counsel’s explanation regarding why he failed to obtain copies of exhibits included in the record of proceedings prior to the June 30, 2005, hearing). We do not find merit in the respondent’s unsupported assertion that the Immigration Judge deemed prior counsel’s assistance to have been ineffective, particularly in light of the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent would be bound by the actions of prior counsel. See Tr. at 115 (Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was bound by the actions of prior counsel). Cf. Tr. at 113 (vague comment regarding effectiveness of prior representation, which does not reveal that the Immigration Judge found prior counsel to have provided ineffective assistance). Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that she suffered prejudice as a result of prior counsel’s failure to object to the DHS’s proffered evidence, as such evidence is routinely received in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.7(a) (providing that an Immigration Judge may receive into evidence prior statements such as those received during the respondent’s removal proceedings). See also Tr. at 124-27, 148-56 (evidencing respondent’s opportunity to cross-examine preparers of two key documents included in the record or proceedings). We therefore find that the respondent has failed to establish that she experienced prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of her removal proceedings. See generally Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 We agree, however, with the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge should not have relied on the written admissions and concession submitted by former counsel (Exh. 6), as the Immigration Judge had indicated that the respondent would not be bound by the withdrawn admission and concession. See I.J. at 15-16; Tr. at 19, 113. Nevertheless, the Immigration Judge’s reliance on the withdrawn submission is harmless error, as the record supports the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent was involved in alien smuggling activity, as defined in section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, even if we disregard the respondent’s earlier concession.¿FN1º See, e.g., Exh. 18 (Report of Investigation, indicating that the respondent previously stated that she was asked to provide transportation to the smugglee, that she realized while in the vehicle that the passport held by the smugglee did not in fact pertain to the her, and that the driver of the vehicle had accompanied the respondent on the trip to Mexico simply because the respondent did not feel well enough to drive); Tr. at 67-68, 82-83, 97 (respondent’s testimony that, prior to her departure for Mexico, her husband requested that she transport the smugglee into the United States, and that she asked her husband about the smugglee’s immigration status and was told that the individual was a United States citizen), 83, 87, 93-94, 96, 105 (respondent’s testimony that she asked to see the smugglee’s documents, and realized that the photograph did not look like the smugglee), 148-56 (respondent’s counsel’s cross-examination of the officer who created the Report of Investigation).
 
The Immigration Judge properly distinguished the respondent’s participation in the smuggling activity under consideration in the instant case from the alien’s limited connection to the smuggling activity at issue in Altamirano v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 586 (9th Cir. 2005). See I.J. at 14-15. Whereas, in Altamirano v. Gonzales, supra, the alien simply had knowledge of the smuggling plan and was present in the vehicle in which her family members were attempting to smuggle an undocumented alien, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was an active participant in the scheme to procure the smugglee’s entrance into the United States. See I.J. at 14-15. See also Tr. at 82-83, 97, 100 (respondent’s testimony that her husband asked her and a neighbor to transport his niece’s friend into the United States). Moreover, in Altamirano v. Gonzales, supra, the Immigration Judge did not question the alien’s credibility. See Altamirano v. Gonzales, supra, at 589 n.2. In contrast, the Immigration Judge gave specific, cogent reasons for disbelieving the respondent’s version of events. Notably, although the respondent disclaims involvement in the scheme to bring the smugglee into the United States, and testified that she did not know of the smugglee’s lack of authorization to enter the United States until after they were placed in secondary inspection, the record reveals that she previously had stated to an immigration officer that she had been asked to transport the smugglee from Mexico into the United States, and that upon picking up the smugglee she realized that the passport that the smugglee had in her possession did not in fact pertain to the smugglee. See I.J. at 10-12, 14, 17-18. Compare Tr. at 50 with Exh. 18 and Tr. at 142-56.
 
*3 Similarly, the respondent’s appellate assertion that the driver of the automobile involved in the smuggling incident was responsible for arranging the transportation of the smugglee is belied by her testimony before the Immigration Judge. See Tr. at 82-83 (respondent’s assertion that she did not ask the driver about the smugglee’s immigration status prior to departing the United States for Mexico because he “did not know ¿the smuggleeº. It ¿wasº not on the side of ¿the driverº”). Based on the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was an active participant in the plan to transport the smugglee into the United States is not clearly erroneous, and we therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent engaged in the illegal activity of alien smuggling after departing the United States. We consequently affirm the Immigration Judge’s corollary finding that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act.
 
Turning next to the respondent’s application for relief from removal, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2). The record does not support the respondent’s appellate contention that, but for brief and casual departures from the United States, she has continually resided in the United States since she was purportedly admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor when she was approximately 2 years of age. Cf. Exh. 21 (indicating that respondent first entered the United States in 1995 without inspection, and noting that she gave birth to three children in Mexico between the years of 1980 and 1986). Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s unsubstantiated assertion that Mexican culture requires a wife to live with and follow the direction of her husband and that, therefore, the husband’s period of residence should be imputed to the wife pursuant to an extension of the holding in Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005). The record supports the Immigration Judge’s finding that the relevant date of admission is the date of the respondent’s admission to the United States as a lawful permanent resident, which was April 18, 2002. See I.J. at 18-20; Exh. 8. Pursuant to the “stop-time rule,” the respondent’s opportunity to accrue the requisite 7 years of residence after admission in any status halted when she was issued a Notice to Appear on April 9, 2004. See Exh. 1. See also sections 240A(a)(1), (d)(1) of the Act. The respondent therefore accrued a maximum of approximately 2 years of continuous, post-admission residence, rather than the necessary 7 years. See I.J. at 21. The Immigration Judge thus properly determined that the respondent is unable to establish statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.
 
*4 Finally, the respondent also asserts on appeal that the immigration court’s policy regarding change of venue is unconstitutional because it requires that an alien concede removability before a motion for change of venue will even be considered. However, we are without authority to consider such constitutional challenges. See, e.g., Matter of Fede, 20 I&N Dec. 35, 36 (BIA 1989).
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Likewise, any confusion regarding whether the smugglee was the niece of the respondent’s husband, or a friend of such niece (I.J. at 10, 14, 16-17; Tr. at 83), also amounts to harmless error, as the record supports the Immigration Judge’s ultimate resolution of the respondent’s case irrespective of the identity of the smugglee.

CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated December 2,2004, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Bermuda in absentia, and deemed his pending application for relief to be abandoned. The respondent thereafter filed an untimely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, which the Immigration Judge denied on August 11, 2005. The respondent then appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, and in a decision dated March 16, 2006, we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the respondent’s former counsel’s assistance was in fact ineffective. At the remanded evidentiary hearing, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent’s prior counsel had not provided ineffective assistance and, moreover, that the respondent had departed the United States prior to submitting the motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge has now certified the record back to the Board in a decision dated February 7, 2007, in order for us to determine whether the respondent’s departure from the United States served to divest the immigration court of jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
The respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s finding that he physically departed the United States in November 2004, prior to his December 2, 2004, removal hearing.¿FN1º We therefore accept the Immigration Judge’s factual finding that the respondent so departed the United States, as the respondent has failed to establish that such finding was clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); I.J. (February 7, 2007, decision) at 3. The regulations preclude the filing of a motion to reopen with an immigration judge by or on behalf of an individual who is the subject of removal proceedings, subsequent to such individual’s departure from the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) (governing motions filed before the Board). Consequently, the respondent’s departure from the United States in November 2004, while he was the subject of removal proceedings, had the effect of depriving the immigration court of jurisdiction over his subsequently-filed motion to reopen. As the Immigration Judge is without jurisdiction to grant the motion to reopen, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
In addition, the respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that he received actual, in-person, prior notice of his December 2, 2004, removal hearing, which included a warning regarding the consequences of failure to appear. See I.J. (February 7, 2007, decision) at 4. Moreover, we find ample support in the record for the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s former counsel did not render ineffective assistance to the respondent. See I.J. (February 7, 2007, decision) at 3-5 (finding no ineffective assistance of counsel, and recounting respondent’s assertion that he would have departed the United States prior to his removal hearing irrespective of his attorney’s advice); Unidentified Appellate Submissions (January 4, 2006, letter from Massachusetts Office of the Bar Counsel, indicating that no disciplinary action would be taken against respondent’s former counsel and closing respondent’s file regarding his grievance against former counsel, and January 24, 2006, letter from the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers, upholding Office of Bar Counsel’s decision to close respondent’s file). The respondent has thus failed to establish that exceptional circumstances prevented him from attending his December 2, 2004, removal hearing. As the respondent neglected to attend his December 2, 2004, removal hearing notwithstanding the Immigration Judge’s explicit, in-person admonition regarding the consequences of such failure to appear, and the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances excusing his failure to appear, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), (iii). We will therefore sua sponte vacate that portion of our March 16, 2006, decision which remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Our decision dated March 16, 2006, is vacated to the extent that it remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the respondent’s former counsel rendered ineffective assistance.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s December 2, 2004, decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gene P. Tausk, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John McPhail
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s February 22, 2007, decision finding him removable from the United States and pretermitting his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony. Also, he avers that the Immigration Judge erred in ordering him removed during a master calendar hearing. In that regard, he asserts that the Immigration Judge should have allowed him additional time to present his case. Last, he claims that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsels.
 
The record reveals that the respondent sustained a 2003 conviction for delivery of marijuana in a drug free zone.¿FN1º See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 481.120, 481.134. The Immigration Judge determined that this offense qualified as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), and we find no reversible error in that determination. According to the United States Supreme Court, a state drug offense qualifies as a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and, by extension, an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act if the offense would have been punishable as a felony under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), 21 U.S.C. § 802 et seq. Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47, 127 S. Ct. 625, 630-31 (2006). The Texas offense of delivery of marijuana is comparable to the federal offense of marijuana distribution, which is punishable under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) by a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years, making it a federal “felony.” Lopez v. Gonzales, supra, at 631 n.7 (holding that “for purposes of § 924(c)(2) the crimes the CSA defines as ‘felonies’ are those crimes to which it assigns a punishment exceeding one year’s imprisonment.”). 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) provides an exception for one who distributed a “small amount of marijuana for no remuneration” however; documents in the record reflect that the respondent transferred marijuana to a minor in exchange for a sum of United States currency.¿FN2º Hence, the offense did involve marijuana “trafficking” in the conventional sense of that term. Accordingly, we agree that as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3).
 
*2 Also, we do not find error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to proceed with the respondent’s removal hearing and order him removed during a master calendar hearing. The respondent had appeared before the Immigration Judge on 2 occasions. During the respondent’s second master calendar hearing, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was ineligible for the relief that he sought and thus ordered him removed. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Immigration Judge had acted in an inappropriate manner by proceeding with the removal hearing.
 
Last, the respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but fails to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also, Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). While he submitted copies of letters that he allegedly mailed to his former attorneys, there is nothing in the record to show that the letters had been delivered or received by his former counsels. Furthermore, he has not filed a complaint with the necessary entered into with his former counsels. Based on the record before us, we do not find that the respondent was ineffectively represented.
 
In conclusion, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is removable as charged and does not appear to be eligible for any form of relief. Accordingly, his appeal is dismissed.

The record also reflects that on January 4, 2007, the respondent pied guilty to attempted possession of a controlled substance.

Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4), a defendant who demonstrates that he distributed “a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration” may be punished as a misdemeanant rather than a felon. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) does not define a discrete offense, however; rather, it is a sentencing provision that describes a “mitigating exception” to the otherwise-applicable 5-year statutory maximum called for by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D). See, e.g., United States v. Hamlin, 319 F.3d 666, 670-71 (4th Cir. 2003) (federal prosecutor seeking a 5-year sentence against a marijuana distributor not required by Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of marijuana distributed was “large” or that remuneration was present); United States v. Outen, 286 F.3d 622, 638 (2d Cir. 2002) (same). Thus, it is the defendant who must prove the additional facts (i.e., the “smallness” of the amount of marijuana and the absence of remuneration) that trigger the exception. In the absence of any evidentiary showing by the respondent that he would have qualified for this mitigating exception had he been prosecuted federally, we conclude that the proper federal analogue for his state crime is felony marijuana distribution. Cf. Matter of P-F-, 20 I&N Dec. 661, 663 n.2 (BIA 1993).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Anthony J. Keber, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 By decision dated February 23, 2007, the Board denied the respondents’ Motion to Reopen, which was filed on December 11, 2006. The respondents have now filed a motion for reconsideration of our February 23, 2007 denial of their motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not submitted a response.
 
Based on the record before us,¿FN1º we find that the instant case warrants sua sponte reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, we will remand the record to enable the respondents to apply for any applicable relief from removal.
 
Due to the nature of our disposition of this matter, we need not address the respondents’ other arguments. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ removal proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Resendez Guajardo, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(C), I&NAct ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)º - Controlled substance trafficker
  
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s March 7, 2006, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States as an alien who the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance. See section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
 
The respondent was apprehended in May 2005, when he applied for admission at San Francisco International Airport as a returning lawful permanent resident. At that time the respondent was paroled into the United States for deferred inspection. His parole was subsequently revoked, a Notice to Appear was issued and he was placed in removal proceedings. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the court documents of record support the immigration inspector’s conclusion that at the time of the respondent’s attempted entry into the United States, there was “reason to believe” that he was or had been an illicit trafficker in marijuana or cannabis. Id.; Fla. Stat. § 893.13(1)(c)(2). It is noted for the record that the respondent conceded that he sold marijuana in Florida in 1995. Tr. at 12.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he plead nolo contendere in his criminal proceedings, and therefore was not convicted within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and thus not removable or inadmissible. This argument is without merit. The ground of inadmissibility under which the respondent was charged, is not one that requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to prove an actual conviction exists under drug trafficking laws in order to sustain the charge, despite the respondent’s assertions to the contrary. See section 212(a)(2)(C); see also Molina v. Ashcroft, 368 F.3d 1206 (9th Cir. 2004); Alarcon-Serrano v. INS, 220 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The respondent also claims that his prior attorney was ineffective. A claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the claim be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553,556 (BIA 2003); cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 It is noted that respondent has failed to meet the above-noted requirements of prongs one and three. Additionally, although the respondent did forward a letter to prior counsel on October 31, 2006, no response is contained in the record of proceedings currently before this Board. It should also be noted that the record contains a letter from the respondent’s prior counsel, which serves as notification of his withdrawal. This letter states that on five occasions prior counsel attempted to contact the respondent and further, that the Respondent owes a substantial amount of money to his prior counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stephen M. Ruhle
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case shall be remanded. The respondent has asserted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested that the Board summarily affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The DHS argues that the respondent failed to meet the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The record of proceeding contains an EOIR-28, indicating that the respondent was represented by counsel at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s counsel was informed by the Immigration Judge of the due date for the respondent’s application for cancellation relief (Tr. at 36). The application was not filed by the March 16, 2007, deadline and by written decision dated March 19, 2007, the Immigration Judge deemed the application as abandoned.
 
In asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has indicated that he was surprised to receive the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent asserts that he was under the impression that his attorney would comply with the deadline. The respondent has included copies of several letters he sent to his attorney via certified mail indicating that he was upset, and seeking clarification. We find that the respondent, who is pro se on appeal, has substantially complied with the Lozada requirements. The respondent’s letters indicate that there was an issue over respondent’s lack of full payment to the attorney of record. However, there is no letter of request to withdraw as respondent’s attorney. In fact, the record of proceeding does not show any further communication with the court by the respondent’s attorney of record after the December 19, 2006, hearing. Upon review of the record as a whole, we find that although the respondent has not fully complied with the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, he has clearly demonstrated that he was prejudiced. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 533 (BIA 2003).
 
Finally, The respondent contests his detention and raises issues related to the determination of his bond. We note that any such issues are not properly before this Board as such concerns shall be separate and apart from any removal hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d). We therefore remand the record to the Immigration Judge to afford the respondent a further opportunity to submit an application for cancellation relief based on the aforementioned.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Diana Cobar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael D. Steinberg
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 11182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
  
APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver
 
On March 20, 2006, an Immigration Judge issued a decision finding the respondent removable as charged under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as an alien inadmissible based on fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). The Immigration Judge did not find that the respondent was subject to removal based on the charge under 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act as he was not an arriving alien. The Immigration Judge rejected the respondent’s request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act of the sustained ground of removal, and ordered him removed to the Philippines.
 
The respondent appeals, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. He moves to remand the proceedings so that the Immigration Judge can consider evidence relevant to the fraud underpinning his removability charge¿FN1º. The motion to remand will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent sets forth his claim of ineffective assistance in accordance with the framework established in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition to the procedural requirements, however, he must also establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s ineffectiveness. See Id. at 640. The respondent must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted). Here, the respondent asserts that he provided former counsel with evidence that, unbeknownst to him, his wife had previously entered into a marriage that was never terminated. He contends that, since his marriage was void ab initio, he was not in fact married when he entered the United States and thus did not make a false statement that he was the unmarried son of a lawful permanent resident. The respondent asserts that former counsel disregarded the evidence proving the marriage was void and instead advised him to admit he was legally married and pursue a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. He reasons that the evidence of his void marriage is new since counsel’s ineffective assistance prevented its submission earlier in the proceedings.
 
*2 The underlying removal charge at issue here, section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, provides:
Any alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act is inadmissible.
 
Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent testified that when he entered the United States in 1995, he told immigration officials that he was unmarried despite marrying his wife in 1986, because he was uncertain whether the marriage was valid. Tr. at 16, 18-19. Further, when he filed a visa petition in 1996 on behalf of his wife, following his return to the Philippines and a second marriage to that same wife, he did not disclose the 1986 marriage. Id. at 19. Since the respondent admitted that he was unsure whether he was a party to a valid marriage, his assertion to immigration officials that he was not married, and his failure to disclose the fact of the 1986 marriage on the visa petition for his wife, were willful misrepresentations of a material fact in order to obtain visas. The dispositive factor is the respondent’s conduct in averring unequivocally that he was unmarried when actually he had entered into a marriage that may have been valid. That conduct constituted a willful misrepresentation to obtain an immigration benefit, irrespective of the respondent’s subsequent discovery that the marriage was not legitimate.
 
Since the respondent admitted that he had willfully misrepresented his marital status on two occasions, any failure by former counsel to submit evidence that the marriage was void did not result in prejudice because such evidence could not cure the misrepresentation. Thus, the respondent cannot sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and we see no basis to remand the record for consideration of the evidence which would not alter the outcome. We further find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was removable, or that he was ineligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

One month after filing his appeal, the respondent moved before the Immigration Judge to reopen the proceedings based on his ineffective assistance claim. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposed the motion. The Immigration Judge, noting that he lacked jurisdiction over the case since the appeal had vested jurisdiction with the Board, forwarded the motion to us.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Finees M. Casado, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gregory J. Ball,
Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on March 30, 2007, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
The respondent now suggests that his waiver of appeal was invalid because of erroneous legal advice he was given. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). He argues that he received ineffective assistance from a professional inmate legal assistance group. However, he has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he or she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has provided no affidavit setting forth the agreement with this legal organization, has not shown that this group has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority. The assertion in the motion that the respondent intends to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only if the case is first reopened, see Respondent’s Motion, at page 5, is insufficient as a reason to excuse the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent does not explain why he did not raise the claim of ineffective assistance in his appeal, when he knew or should have known of the alleged erroneous advice and had already retained counsel at that point. Consequently, we find no error in our prior decision summarily dismissing the appeal. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000)(the decision to reopen proceedings is a discretionary decision, and this court applies a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard when reviewing the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen).
 
We therefore lack jurisdiction over this case, and we find no error in our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the motion is denied and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - Nonimmigrant - remained longer than permitted (withdrawn)
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 8, 2007, is affirmed. On appeal, the respondent contends that he was subject to ineffective assistance of counsel by his criminal attorney. The pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks, not constituting direct appeals, do not serve to negate the finality of the conviction or the charge of deportability, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to that motion. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 1993)(holding that collateral attacks on convictions in state court have no impact on their finality, and finding that Immigration Judge did not err in denying request for continuance so respondent could pursue motion to vacate conviction in California state court); Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); see also Okabe v. INS, 671 F.2d 863 (5th Cir. 1982); Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, 516 F.2d 565 (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1050 (1976). In addition, the respondent is precluded from collaterally attacking his criminal record of conviction in a removal proceeding. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085 (9th Cir. 1993). The respondent also contends that his immigration counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the removal hearing. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In some cases, the Ninth Circuit has not required strict compliance with Lozada requirements, especially when the record shows “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002). However, the respondent’s contention is conclusory in nature and he has made no such showing. See Puga v. Chertoff, 488F.3d812 2007 WL 1500308 (9th Cir. May 24, 2007).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent suggests that he may be eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), but it is evident that his criminal conviction renders him statutorily ineligible for such relief pursuant to section 240A(b)(1)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sufen Hilf, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 31, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our July 10, 2006, decision in which we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s October 25, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s October 11, 2005, motions to reconsider and reopen proceedings.
 
On January 26, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen based, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends that this motion is timely filed. See Respondent’s Motion at 5. We disagree. Our July 10, 2006, decision (dismissing the respondent’s appeal) remains the final administrative order in this case.¿FN1º See Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999) (stating that an administrative decision becomes final when the Board reaches a decision on appeal). Thus, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before October 10, 2006. Also, as the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen (October 11, 2005, motion to reopen and reconsider filed before the Immigration Judge), his motion is number barred. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7) (stating that a party may file only one motion to reopen, and that such a motion must be filed within 90 days following the date of the final administrative decision); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Therefore, the instant motion is time and number barred unless the respondent can establish that he falls within an exception to these statutory and regulatory limitations on motions to reopen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that equitable tolling can apply to the time limits on motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417 (6th Cir. 2007). Although, the Sixth Circuit has not specifically held that equitable tolling applies to numerical limitations on motions to reopen. Id.
 
The pivotal issue before us is whether the respondent has established that equitable tolling is warranted based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent asserts that all three of his prior attorneys - Mr. Nadadur Sampath Kumar, Ms. Vera Weisz, and Mr. David Wegner were ineffective. The respondent has complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Respondent’s Motion at 7-8, Attachments 6, 8, and 17. We need not consider the claims raised against all three attorneys because we find that Mr. Wegner’s representation was ineffective and prejudiced the respondent’s removal proceedings. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Given the respondent’s due diligence, we find equitable toiling is warranted in this case.
 
*2 On September 15, 2005, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had abandoned his applications for relief because they were not filed on or before the August 12, 2005, deadline and ordered the respondent removed from the United States. Mr. Wegner filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge explaining that he did not timely file the respondent’s applications because he believed that since the date of the merits hearing was postponed, the applications deadline would also be postponed. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion and on July 10, 2006, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. Mr. Wegner cited no authority for his mistaken belief that the Immigration Judge’s application filing deadline was altered when the merits hearing was postponed. Yet, he continued to inform the respondent that the Immigration Judge’s decision was “totally unjust.” See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachment 8(c)(i) (Mr. Wegner’s September 27, 2005, letter to the respondent). Mr. Wegner continued to make this argument when he filed a motion to reconsider with this Board on August 9, 2006. But for Mr. Wegner’s mistake, the respondent’s adjustment application would have been timely filed. The respondent’s motion is supported by evidence that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachment 16.
 
The respondent has also demonstrated that he exercised due diligence from the time he discovered Mr. Wegner’s ineffectiveness. After we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider on October 31, 2006, the respondent apparently began to question Mr. Wegner’s judgment and conduct. By November 2006, he retained new counsel, filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and on January 26, 2007, he filed the instant motion to reopen.
 
Finally, we come to the issue of whether the respondent is precluded from applying for adjustment of status because he failed to voluntarily depart pursuant to a 120-day grant of voluntary departure by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Officer John Brechtel on July 19, 2003. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachments 4 and 6(c)(i) (Form 1-210). In light of our recent decision in Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007), and given the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the respondent’s failure to depart pursuant to the DHS order was not voluntary. Notably, the respondent has proffered evidence showing that Office Brechtel may have rescinded the grant of voluntary departure. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachments 6(d) and (e), and 7. Additionally, there is no evidence that voluntary departure as granted by the DHS in this case is contractual in nature as is the voluntary departure granted by an Immigration Judge. Matter of Zmijewska, spura at 93.
 
Based on the foregoing, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to that the respondent can apply for relief from removal.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sigang Li, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 14, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s November 9, 2004, decision finding that the respondent had abandoned his applications for relief and ordering him deported to the Dominican Republic.
 
On May 1, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance by his prior counsel, Ms. Vinaya Saijwani. The motion was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent argues that we should equitably toll the 90-day time limit on filing motions to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that aliens raising an ineffective assistance claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably toiled. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248 (3rd Cir. 2005).
 
We find that equitable tolling is warranted in this case. The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and has demonstrated that Ms. Saijwani’s conduct has prejudiced his case. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Ms. Saijwani admitted that due to her personal problems she failed to timely file the respondent’s applications for relief from removal. Nevertheless, she continued to represent the respondent on appeal and never asserted that her own conduct constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also contends that Ms. Saijwani failed to inform him of our February 14, 2006, decision until after he was detained on April 23, 2007. Ms. Saijwani, who has been notified of the respondent’s claim, has not challenged the respondent’s assertions of misconduct. The respondent, by and through new counsel, exercised due diligence by filing the instant motion to reopen within days of learning of our prior order.
 
Although the respondent asserts that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), he has not proffered his application in support of this motion. In light of the facts of this case and the failure to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to object or otherwise respond to this motion, we will grant the respondent’s reopening to afford him the opportunity to apply for relief from removal. While we find reopening appropriate in this case, the respondent must establish his eligibility for cancellation of removal despite his 1991 conviction for conspiracy to illegally acquire and possess food stamps.
 
*2 The respondent also claims that Ms. Saijwani should have filed a motion to terminate so that he could pursue his pending naturalization application. See Respondent’s Motion at 4. While the respondent may file such a motion in remanded proceedings, we make no judgment on its merits given the respondent’s 1991 conviction. See generally Matter of Acosta Hidalgo, 24 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2007) (removal proceedings may only be terminated pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f) where the DHS has presented an affirmative communication attesting to the alien’s prima facie eligibility for naturalization). The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent, with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio M. Zaldana, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lee P. Crystal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us when in a decision dated May 12, 1997, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 12, 1997, as untimely filed and not properly before us. On November 24, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and seeking to reapply for relief pursuant to the former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to aliens who pled guilty prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)). The respondent’s motion is granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.
 
Although the motion is untimely filed, the respondent claims that he should receive the benefit of “equitable tolling” of the filing deadline because the attorney who earlier represented him, Jose M. Quinones, who was since suspended from practice before the Board, failed to file a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s February 12, 1997, decision, after allegedly placing the matter in the hands of a “notario,” and then failed to tell him of our final order. The respondent has not complied with all the procedural requirements we set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but as this case falls under the jurisdiction of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, we find the respondent has presented a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir 2000) (Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir 1999) (the court found the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien’s late petition is the result of the deceptive actions by a notary posing as an attorney). Consequently, even though the respondent’s motion is untimely filed, applying Ninth Circuit precedent, we find that the respondent’s situation falls within the Ninth Circuit’s “equitable tolling” policy. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
*2 A “motion to reopen proceedings seeks to reopen proceedings so that new evidence can be presented and so that a new decision can be entered, normally after a further evidentiary hearing.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 403 (BIA 1991). Such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Finally, an alien must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought before a motion to reopen will be granted. Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 482 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondent has demonstrated that consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, supra, and the new section 212(c) regulation found at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(a), he is no longer precluded from establishing his eligibility for a waiver on inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, and that reopening of the proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the Board’s May 12, 1997, decision will be vacated, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to allow the respondent the opportunity to establish his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act, or any other form of relief to which he may be entitled.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s May 12, 1997, decision is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Seth B. Fitter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondent has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s order dated February 24, 2006. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Egypt. Prior to being placed in removal proceedings, he married a United States citizen. The respondent’s wife filed an immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) on behalf of the respondent on September 16, 2003. The respondent filed an adjustment of status application at the same time. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent several continuances to allow the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) time to adjudicate the Form I-130 visa petition (Tr. at 1-2, 7, 10-12, 13-14). On August 14, 2005, the Immigration Judge stated that if the visa petition were still pending at the next scheduled hearing date (February 24, 2006), the respondent could move for another continuance (Tr. at 14).
 
On February 24, 2006, a new Immigration Judge was assigned to the matter (Tr. at 15). The respondent’s attorney advised the Immigration Judge that the DHS had instructed him that it would not adjudicate the respondent’s visa petition until after the Immigration Judge issued a decision in the case (Tr. at 18-22). The respondent’s attorney inquired about the possibility of an order of administrative closure, and the attorney for the DHS opposed such an order (Tr. at 16-17). When voluntary departure was raised as a potential form of relief, the respondent was asked what he wanted to do (Tr. at 23-26). The respondent stated that he wanted a continuance (Tr. at 26). A brief recess was held, and after the recess the respondent’s counsel advised the Immigration Judge that the respondent said he wanted a continuance (Tr. at 27-28). The Immigration Judge concluded that since the DHS was apparently refusing to adjudicate the visa petition, the Immigration Judge would have to issue an order of removal or an order of voluntary departure (Tr. at 28). The respondent was then qualified for voluntary departure and granted voluntary departure (Tr. at 29-35). Through counsel, the respondent waived appeal (Tr. at 36).
 
The respondent now alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing because counsel should have moved for a continuance and if the motion were denied, should have appealed from the order of the Immigration Judge. The respondent contends that under controlling law, the Immigration Judge was obligated to grant continuances until the visa petition was adjudicated. See Benslimane v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 828 (7th Cir. 2005); Subhan v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir. 2004).
 
*2 In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), affd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we held that ineffective assistance claims require: (1) that the respondent submit an affidavit detailing the agreement between the respondent and his counsel; (2) that the attorney whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the respondent state whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the respondent establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001). He has complied with the technical requirements and has also established that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance that rendered the proceedings unfair. The respondent’s former counsel should have been aware of controlling law that required the Immigration Judge to grant continuances in cases such as this one. Because of his former counsel’s actions, the respondent waived appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision, a decision that effectively, and improperly, denied the respondent an opportunity to have a hearing on his application for adjustment of status.
 
Accordingly, we will sustain the appeal and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The order of the Immigration Judge dated February 24, 2006, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the issuance of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa A. Baird, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bruce B. Dizengoff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; section 212(c) waiver
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from a December 19, 2005, decision of an Immigration Judge, denying his motion to reopen proceedings following the previous entry of an in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The respondent argues that he was deprived of due process as a consequence of ineffective assistance of his former counsel and as such, he has not had a fair hearing in these proceedings. See section 240(b)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A); see also Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127 (3rd Cir. 2001). The respondent has not complied with the mandatory requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and we thus decline to sustain the appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel, for the reasons set forth in Matter of Lozada at 639-40.
 
We will, however, under the unusual circumstances of this case, remand the record for further proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). No single circumstance, on its own, leads us to conclude that a remand is necessary, but the sum total of the circumstances presented in this case leads us to the conclusion that the exceptional circumstances necessary for sua sponte reopening (or, analogously, remand) exist in this case. Cf. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We first note that the respondent does not have appeared to attempt to delay these proceedings in any way. Cf. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 108 (1988) (discussing the heavy burden a party filing a motion to reopen bears and the government’s legitimate interest in discouraging delays in immigration litigation). We also take notice of the asserted recent death of the respondent’s daughter (Respondent’s Br. at 5). Additionally, we agree with the respondent that there is a possibility that the Immigration Judge reached a conclusion in this case before all the evidence was presented (see, e.g. Tr. at 105, quoted at page 5 of the respondent’s brief), and we cannot be fully confident that the respondent has had a full opportunity for a fair hearing. Consequently, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary Elizabeth Delli-Pizzi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David Burke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered deported from the United States on July 12, 1991, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on May 20, 2004, but the Immigration Judge denied it on June 25, 2004. An appeal followed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”). On January 18, 2005, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion. These proceedings were remanded to the Board on November 7, 2005, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent argues in his motion to reopen and before the Board that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and therefore established that “reasonable cause” was responsible for his failure to appear for the hearing.¿FN1º The respondent does not deny that his former counsel, Mike Herrera, was notified of his hearing. He contends, however, that former counsel knew that he was living in Chicago when he received the notice, and he did not make an attempt to notify him of the hearing. He argues that he should not be penalized on account of his former counsel’s negligence. The respondent provided proof that he filed a complaint against his former counsel with the Texas Bar Association. Another former counsel of the respondent, Michael P. DiRaimondo, indicates in his statement that he served Mr. Herrera with a copy of the motion to reopen to presumably allow Mr. Herrera an opportunity to respond to the allegations. A response from Mr. Herrera is not contained in the record.
 
In an agreed upon motion to remand filed with the Fifth Circuit, the respondent and counsel for the government indicated that the Immigration Judge ignored evidence and considered facts not part of the record in denying the respondent’s motion. The motion to remand and order from the Fifth Circuit does not provide specific examples of such. However, on April 3, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) filed with the Board its position that the record should be remanded to the Immigration Judge to allow him another opportunity to address the respondent’s reopening request in accordance with the concerns raised by the Fifth Circuit. The respondent states in his most recently filed brief with the Board that he is in agreement with the remand request of the DHS. Inasmuch as both the respondent and the DHS have determined that it is appropriate for the Immigration Judge to again address the respondent’s motion to reopen, we shall honor the request. Our prior decision is therefore vacated, and these proceedings are remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

In Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993), this Board held that in all deportation cases where the Notice of Hearing for which the alien failed to appear was served after June 13, 1992, an alien must satisfy the standard for reopening cited in sections 242B(c)(3)(A) and 242B(f)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A) and (f)(2). If an alien was served a Notice of Hearing prior to June 13, 1992, he must satisfy the standards for reopening set forth in former section 242(b)of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). Under section 242(b) of the Act, the alien must establish that he had reasonable cause for his absence from the proceedings. Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). The regulations do not contain any time or numerical limitations on aliens who wish to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. See Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998); Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I& N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii).

IN RE: MARCOS ALFONSO SOLIS-ENRIQUEZ
FILE: AXX XX7 212 - SEATTLE
June 5, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated March 29, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A hearing notice which is sent by certified mail to the alien’s last known address is sufficient to establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien received “written notice” of the deportation hearing within the meaning of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Here, the Immigration Judge found that the Notice of Hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent by certified mail, which return receipt was signed by the respondent (Exh. 2).
 
An order of deportation issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge either within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances (8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(1)) or at any time if the alien demonstrates he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own (8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(2)).
 
In his motion to reopen filed on March 16, 2007, and again on appeal, the respondent claims that he did not receive notice of his hearing and that he was never informed of the requirement to inform the Immigration Court (IC) of his address changes. He further indicates that he was represented by counsel in Los Angeles, who presumably failed to inform the respondent of his hearing.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the record establishes that the respondent was advised of the requirement to notify of address changes and that he received the NOH. Specifically, the Order to Show Cause (OSC) was personally served on the respondent on July 31, 1993 (Exh. 1). The OSC contained explicit warnings of keeping the IC apprised of his address changes, and the warning was also provided in Spanish. The record also contains a signed postal return receipt indicating that he received the NOH (Exh. 2).
 
We find no merit to the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge is not a fingerprinting expert, and thus cannot discern whether the respondent indeed received the NOH. The Immigration Judge made no fingerprinting analysis, but instead correctly noted the striking similarity between the respondent’s signature on the OSC, request to change venue and the NOH return receipt. It is the respondent’s burden to show that reopening is warranted and thus any “expert” analysis should come from him. We concur with the Immigration Judge that the signatures appear to be the respondent’s. Compare Chaidez v. Gonzales, 2007 WL 1438455 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
*2 To the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance by former counsel, we find no merit. First, the record reflects that the respondent signed the return receipt for the NOH, so he was aware of the hearing date. Second, the December 8, 1993, in absentia order was mailed to the respondent at the same address as that contained in the NOH, with a courtesy copy mailed to his counsel, and there is no indication in the record that it was returned undelivered. Lastly, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails because the respondent has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
For the aforementioned reasons, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen these deportation proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tsz-Hai Huang, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on August 26, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred. On May 31, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the respondent’s unopposed motion to remand for consideration of previously unavailable evidence. The motion will be denied.
 
The only evidence cited in support of the motion is that the respondent’s first attorney, Randhir Kang, has been disbarred. However, this development does not affect our previous disposition of the respondent’s case. We have repeatedly considered and denied the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to Mr. Kang, and the fact of his disbarment does not cure the unexplained untimeliness of his prior motions or his failure to properly notify Mr. Kang of the allegations against him and his failure to provide an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). At most, it may excuse the filing of a bar complaint, but in this case, the complaint was filed. Moreover, the disbarment does not, in itself, establish that Mr. Kang provided ineffective assistance to the respondent. In fact, after investigating the bar complaint, the State Bar of California concluded that the respondent’s claim “does not warrant action,” as the Mr. Kang’s conduct “does not provide a basis for imposing discipline.” Therefore, the fact that Mr. Kang has been disbarred for conduct in other cases has little bearing on the respondent’s particular case. Finally, the respondent’s current motion does not address our finding that the respondent himself was primarily responsible for the circumstances leading to the denial of the ineffective assistance of counsel motions filed against Mr. Kang by his second attorney, Olumide Obayemi. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The transcript of proceedings shows that the respondent, by counsel, conceded that he was inadmissible and subject to removal due to his 2005 Minnesota Controlled Substance Crime in the Third Degree-Sale convictions (Tr. at 37-39), and as he was statutorily ineligible for relief on account of these drug trafficking aggravated felony convictions (Tr. at 44-45), he waived his right to appeal (Tr. at 45). The Immigration Judge noted in his February 12, 2007, decision that the respondent had waived appeal. On March 14, 2007, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26).
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal). The respondent on the Notice of Appeal argues that his former counsel did not adequately explain his options to him, and this led to his accepting the waiver. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board).
 
However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim.¿FN1º See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006)(citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5th Cir. 2000)(upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). However, even if were to find the respondent had substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, the respondent must also establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (“alien’s right to due process is violated when ‘the representation afforded ¿ himº was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing,’ and, as a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice.”). Specifically, the respondent’s former counsel acknowledged that the respondent’s 2005 Minnesota Controlled Substance Crime in the Third Degree-Sale convictions were aggravated felony convictions that precluded the respondent from establishing his eligibility for relief and waived appeal stating that “it’s not in ¿the respondent’sº best interest to appeal and stay in jail unnecessarily (Tr. at 45).”¿FN2º See Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475-76 (5th Cir. 2004) (former counsel’s alleged failure to file an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of discretionary relief was not ineffective since alien was not entitled to relief that is available only in the exercise of the Attorney General’s discretion). There is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence to support his contention that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions so as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

The assertion in the appellate brief that the respondent intends to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only if requested, see Respondent’s Mot., at p. 4, is insufficient as a reason to excuse the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements.

In this regard, we note the record reflects the respondent was convicted of the offense of Controlled Substance Crime in the Third Degree in violation of MINN. STAT. ANN. § 152.023 subdiv.1(1) (Exh. 2). Section 152.023 provides as follows:
§ 152.023 Controlled substance crime in the third degree
Subdivision 1. Sale crimes. A person is guilty of controlled substance crime in the third degree if:
(1) the person unlawfully sells one or more mixtures containing a narcotic drug;
As the language of MINN. STAT. ANN. § 152.023 subdiv.1(1) makes clear, a conviction thereunder necessarily involves “illicit trafficking” in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)), and constitutes an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), thereby precluding his eligibility for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert M. Birach, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tara L. Good
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. In a decision dated June 9, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, as well as protection under the Convention Against Torture. On July 11, 2006, the respondent appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision, and we rejected the appeal as untimely on July 28, 2006. On August 4, 2006, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our July 28, 2006, decision, which we denied on September 26, 2006. On November 6, 2006, the respondent filed a “Motion to Re-open and Request for Stay of Removal.” On January 17, 2007, we denied the motion as a motion to reconsider because it was numerically barred and as a motion to reopen for lack of jurisdiction. The respondent now seeks to reopen proceedings alleging that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a timely appeal. The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
Even assuming that the respondent’s motion to reopen is not numerically barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), we nonetheless find that it is untimely. The regulations governing motions to reopen before the Board provide that a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date on which a final administrative decision is rendered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(e)(2). In this case, the final administrative decision was rendered on July 28, 2006. A timely motion to reopen was thus due on or before October 28, 2006. The respondent’s motion, however, was not filed until February 15, 2007.
 
Moreover, although the respondent alleges in his motion to reopen that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, he has failed to establish that the doctrine of equitable tolling should be applied to excuse the time limitation applicable to his motion. Specifically, we find that the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s failure to file a timely appeal. See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 865-66 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that prejudice must be established even when an alien has been denied the opportunity to appeal because of an attorney’s actions or inactions); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In his motion, the respondent did not raise any specific claims that the Immigration Judge erred in the underlying decision. Thus, the respondent has not established that a timely appeal would have been successful. See Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696, 699-700 (6th Cir. 2001) (finding that an alien presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must establish that, but for his prior attorney’s failures, he would have been entitled to remain in the United States). Moreover, we find that the respondent failed to establish that he fully complied with the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although the respondent presented a copy of a letter he purportedly sent his prior attorney relating to the alleged ineffective assistance, this letter was sent only 1 day prior to the filing of the letter with the Board. Thus, the attorney would not have had time to respond to the allegations of ineffective assistance prior to the filing of the letter, and the respondent has not filed any subsequent documents or pleadings to indicate whether he received any response from the attorney. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. To the extent that the respondent relies in his motion to reopen on Scorteneau v. INS, 339 F.3d 407 (6th Cir. 2003), we find that it is distinguishable because it involved an alien’s failure to exercise due diligence in filing a motion to reopen after learning about his attorney’s alleged misfeasance, which is not at issue here.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Myra L. Hammond, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James R. McHenry III
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2006 decision denying his most recent motion to continue and ordering him removed. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a memorandum in support of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A review of the hearing transcripts shows that the respondent was granted various continuances, for a variety of reasons, since the hearing on August 18, 2003. The most recent motion for a continuance was for the adjudication of a Labor Certification that had been pending with the State of Alabama since April 30, 2001. The respondent had declined to apply for any other form of relief (Tr. at 24).
 
The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge and based on whether good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996). At the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent had had approximately 3 years, since June 2003 when the Notice to Appear was issued, to have the Labor Certification adjudicated favorably (and approximately 5 years since the Labor Certificate apparently was filed with the State of Alabama). We find that the Immigration Judge did not err in denying a continuance for the purpose of obtaining a Labor Certification which might lead to a visa. See Zafar v. Attorney General, 426 F.3d 1330 (11th Cir. 2005). The pertinent facts in the current case are similar to those in Zafar, specifically that the Labor Certification is still pending and has not been approved yet. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that the facts in Zafar are distinguishable in that Zafar’s request for a continuance was denied the first time it was requested, unlike the facts in the current case where there were previously granted motions to continue. We find this not a significant, distinguishable fact. Accordingly, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion.
 
To the extent that the respondent has attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (see respondent’s appellate brief at 7-8), we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dan R. Larsson, Esquire
*1 This case is presently before us on remand by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On February 8, 2007, the Ninth Circuit granted the parties’ joint motion to remand this case to the Board. The parties jointly agreed that a remand “is appropriate to allow the Board to reassess the jurisdictional issue raised in this case in light of Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2006) and Weidersperg v. INS, 896 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir. 1990).” See Joint Motion on Remand to the Board dated December 13, 2006.
 
The procedural history of this case is as follows. On January 12, 1999, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia. On February 24, 1999, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s February 16, 1999, motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). Two days later, on February 26, 1999, the respondent was removed from the United States. See Respondent’s March 23, 2005, Motion to Reopen at 51.
 
On or about April 1, 1999, the respondent reentered the United States. Years after his return to the United States, on March 23, 2005, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and lack of notice. On May 18, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for lack of jurisdiction because the respondent had been removed from this country. See 8 C.F.R. §1003.23(b)(1). We affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
Pursuant to the Ninth Circuit’s directive, we will reassess the jurisdictional issue presented in this case. We also reconsider this case in light of the Ninth Circuit’s recent decision in Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007). In that case, the Ninth Circuit held that an alien who was lawfully removed from the United States after the conclusion of immigration proceedings, and who then re-entered illegally and filed an untimely motion to reopen his original deportation proceedings with the Immigration Judge was not barred by the provision in 8 C.F.R. §1003.23(b)(1) which provides that a motion to reopen “shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.”
 
On reconsideration and in light of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Lin v. Gonzales, supra., we find that the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, we will remand the record of proceedings to the Immigration Judge to adjudicate the respondent’s March 23, 2005, motion on its merits and in light of Ninth Circuit precedent.
 
*2 Pursuant to the Ninth Circuit’s February 8, 2007, remand order, and upon further consideration of the issues presented therein, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 21, 2005, and the Immigration Judge’s May 18, 2005, order are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Zachary Nightingale, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on March 1, 2007, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 1, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen with the Board. The motion will be denied.
 
In our March 1, 2007, decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his proceedings based upon the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), and that his admissions and waivers during his proceedings on October 19, 2006, without representation, were intelligent and voluntary. In particular, we concurred in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s 1994 conviction for assault with a deadly weapon by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury in violation of section 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code and his 2006 conviction for vandalism in violation of section 594(b)(1) of the California Penal Code each constitutes a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude rendering the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. As a result, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal.
 
On April 16, 2007, the respondent, through new counsel, filed the instant motion to reopen alleging that his motion before the Immigration Judge was denied and appeal before the Board dismissed due to ineffective assistance of prior counsel. See Respondent’s Motion at 9-20. According to the respondent’s motion, prior counsel’s failure to gather and introduce evidence regarding the respondent’s delusional psychotic disorder was ineffective assistance of counsel because this evidence, says the respondent, establishes that he did not knowingly or intelligently concede removability or waive his right to appeal. Id. at 9. The respondent also avers that he has shown prejudice because the Board and the Immigration Judge were not able to consider this evidence in making their respective decisions and that the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of his motion to reopen and/or appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen. Id. at 11-20. In this regard, the respondent argues that he is entitled to contest his removability and/or apply for relief from removal even if he is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. Id. at 20-27. Further, the respondent disputes the Immigration Judge’s October 19, 2006, decision finding him removable as an aggravated felon under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act based upon his 2006 conviction for resisting an executive officer in violation of California Penal Code section 69.1 Id. at 25-27.
 
*2 Initially, we note that the respondent has substantially complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in making his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Respondent’s Brief at 10. However, we find that the respondent has failed to establish the substance of his claim against prior counsel. In particular, the respondent now claims through his current motion that his siblings notified prior counsel of his psychological problems and delusions during their November 7, 2007, appointment with prior counsel. Thus, the respondent alleges that prior counsel had notice of his condition and that he failed to pursue evidence in this regard resulting in the denial of his motion to reopen and dismissal of his appeal before the Board. In contrast to this claim, prior counsel has submitted a response to the respondent’s allegations in which he states that he was not notified of the respondent’s condition until the end of December 2006, merely 2 weeks before the respondent obtained new counsel and ordered prior counsel to cease work on his case. While we agree that had prior counsel had sufficient notice of the respondent’s delusional condition and said delusional condition contributed to the respondent’s refusal to apply for relief for which he appeared eligible, the respondent may have had a valid claim of ineffective representation, we find that the evidence presented does not sufficiently establish that prior counsel had notice of the respondent’s condition such that he was able to respond. As a result, we cannot find that the respondent has, satisfied his burden in establishing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the record before us.2
 
Despite the respondent’s failure to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, however, we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen could be granted based upon his submission of new evidence which may materially affect the outcome of his proceedings. Specifically, the respondent has presented medical evidence establishing that he suffers from a delusional psychotic disorder which prevents him from being able to decipher reality from his own paranoid delusions. This evidence suggests that the respondent likely did not have the mental capacity to act properly on his own behalf during his proceedings when he dismissed his opportunity to apply for relief from removal. In this regard, we reiterate our prior decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act which renders the respondent’s concessions regarding removability under this charge irrelevant. However, inasmuch as we find that the respondent has met the technical requirements for reopening based upon his motion, we now find it necessary to address the Immigration Judge’s additional finding of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act based upon his conclusion that the respondent’s 2006 conviction for resisting an executive officer in violation of section 69 of the California Penal Code is a “crime of violence” and, thus, an aggravated felony rendering the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*3 California Penal Code section 69 creates criminal liability for “¿e ºvery person who attempts, by means of any threat or violence, to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon such officer by law, or who knowingly resists, by the use of force or violence, such officer, in the performance of his duty.” Section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act defines a crime of violence as any other offense that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. A conviction under section 69 has been construed to cover only threats or use of violence. See People v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 151 Cal.App.3d 893 (Cal. App. Dep’t Super. Ct. 1984); In Re Manuel G, 941 P.2d 880 (Cal. 1997). Therefore, it is a categorical “crime of violence.” As a result, the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act and ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240b(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), due to his conviction for an aggravated felony. In light of this, we find no reason to reopen the respondent’s proceedings inasmuch as he is not eligible for the relief sought and is removable as charged.
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Footnotes

1

The record reflects that the Department of Homeland Security lodged the additional charge of removability against the respondent in its opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge and that the Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b, as a result of this conviction which he found to be an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(F).

In his motion, the respondent’s siblings admit that they cannot provide a copy of the agreement reached with prior counsel nor can they provide evidence establishing that they timely notified prior counsel of the respondent’s condition.

APPLICATION: Termination of Removal Proceedings
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2007, decision sustaining the charges of inadmissibility against him and ordering him removed from the United States to his native Mexico. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States without inspection in 1978 but adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident in 1989. In November 1996 an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent deported from the United States in absentia on the basis of a 1992 California conviction for possession of a controlled substance, and in August 1998 the respondent was physically deported from the United States pursuant to that order. On an unknown date thereafter, the respondent re-entered the United States without being admitted or paroled, and in September 2002 he was convicted pursuant to a guilty plea in California of the offenses of possession of marijuana for sale and transportation of marijuana, for which he was sentenced to a 4-year term of imprisonment. See sections 11359 and 11360(a) of the California Health & Safety Code. On the basis of the aforementioned facts, the Department of Home, land Security (the “DHS”) initiated the present removal proceedings, in which the respondent is charged with inadmissibility to the United States as an alien who: (1) has been convicted of a controlled substance violation; (2) is present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled; and (3) has been removed and who prematurely seeks admission without the Attorney General’s consent. See sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 212(a)(6)(A)(i), and 212(a)(9)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), and 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)(2000). After conducting a number of evidentiary hearings, the Immigration Judge sustained the charges and ordered the respondent removed. The respondent appeals.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent advances two principal arguments. First, he challenges the Immigration Judge’s determination that his 2002 drug conviction is a valid factual predicate for the inadmissibility charge under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act. According to the respondent, the conviction upon which that charge is based was unconstitutional for various reasons. Furthermore, the respondent claims that the records of conviction proffered into evidence by the DHS do not establish by clear and convincing evidence that he was in fact convicted of possession of marijuana for sale. And second, the respondent contends that his 1998 deportation was unlawful because in November 1996—when the Immigration Judge ordered him deported in absentia—he was in State prison in California serving a 32-month sentence for narcotics possession and was therefore unable to attend his deportation hearing through no fault of his own. Accordingly, the respondent appears to maintain that he retains his lawful permanent resident status (i.e., the status he held before he was ordered deported) and that he is therefore not properly charged with inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act. We shall address each argument in turn.
 
The respondent asserts that his 2002 drag conviction is not a valid factual predicate for the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act because his underlying arrest by state law enforcement officers was effected without probable cause and because his criminal defense attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by ostensibly misleading him as to the scope of his plea agreement. It is well-settled, however, that the Immigration Judges and this Board lack authority to adjudicate the constitutionality or substantive validity of state convictions that are alleged as the bases of removal charges. De La Cruz v. INS, 951 F.2d 226, 228 (9th Cir. 1991)(following Ocon-Perez v. INS, 550 F.2d 1153 (9th Cir. 1977)); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). Accordingly, the respondent’s 2002 conviction is valid for immigration purposes unless and until it is vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction. Matter of Madrigal, supra.
 
The respondent also contends that the conviction documents contained within the administrative record do not establish by clear and convincing evidence that he was convicted of possession of marijuana for sale. This contention is belied by the evidence. Specifically, the record contains certified copies of an Information charging him with possession of marijuana for sale (Exh. 3, unnumbered p. 1); a judicial minute order reflecting the entry of a plea of guilty to that charge (Exh. 3, unnumbered p.4); an abstract of judgment reflecting a conviction for possession of marijuana-for sale (Exh. 3, unnumbered p.7); and a signed plea agreement reflecting a plea of guilty to a charge of possession of marijuana for sale and a statement of the basis for the plea which includes an admission that the respondent “willfully and unlawfully possessed marijuana for sale.” (Exh. 3, unnumbered pp.9-10). In short, the evidence could not be clearer that in 2002 the respondent did in fact enter a plea of guilty to the offense of possession of marijuana for sale in violation of section 11359 of the California Health & Safety Code.
 
*3 We now turn to the respondent’s argument regarding the validity of his prior deportation. In a supplemental filing appended to his appellate brief, the respondent has submitted a number of documents which substantiate his assertion that he was in State prison on the date in November 1996 when the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia deportation order against him. However, the respondent has evidently not filed a motion to rescind that order with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over his prior deportation proceedings. Yet by statute the filing of such a motion is the sole means by which an in absentia deportation order can be rescinded. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). This Board has no authority to rescind an in absentia deportation order on our own motion, Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999), and until the respondent secures rescission in accordance with the Act, the present charges will remain valid. For the following reasons, moreover, we do not find under the circumstances of this case that a remand of the record is warranted for further consideration of this issue by the Immigration Judge.
 
Were the respondent to file a motion to rescind and have it acted upon favorably, it may be that the current charges of removability would have to be modified to some extent. For example, if the respondent’s prior deportation order is rescinded, the respondent will be restored to his prior lawful permanent resident status, likely invalidating the present charges that are predicated on his unlawful presence in the United States. See sections 212(a)(6)(A)(i) and 212(a)(9)(A)(i) of the Act. Even if the respondent’s lawful permanent resident status were restored to him, however, it is by no means clear that the charge predicated on his controlled substance violation would have to be modified. See section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(13)(C)(v)(permitting a lawful permanent resident to be charged with inadmissibility as an arriving alien where the alien “has committed an offense identified in section 212(a)(2), unless since such offense the alien has been granted relief under section 212(h) or 240A(a)…”).1 Furthermore, regardless of whether the respondent is charged with removability under section 212(a) of the Act or section 237(a), his 2002 conviction for possession of marijuana for sale disqualifies him from consideration for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(3), and for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), which is unavailable by its terms to aliens who cannot prove that they have not been convicted of an aggravated felony: Section 240A(a)(3) of the Act.
 
*4 According to the United States Supreme Court, a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq. Under that standard, the respondent’s California conviction for possession of marijuana for sale plainly qualifies as an aggravated felony. Specifically, the CSA provides that possession of any quantity of marijuana with intent to distribute is punishable by a term of imprisonment of 5 years. 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(D). An offense punishable by 5 years in prison is a “felony” under the federal criminal law, 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(5), and therefore also qualifies as a felony for purposes of the aggravated felony definition. See Lopez v. Gonzales, supra, at 631 n.7.2
 
In conclusion, because the respondent is removable and ineligible for relief (and would remain so in any event), no constructive purpose would be served by remanding the record for further proceedings. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

The 1992 conviction underlying the respondent’s prior deportation proceedings would qualify as an “offense identified in section 212(a)(2),” as would the 1996 conviction for which he was imprisoned at the time of his November 1996 deportation heating and the 2002 conviction alleged in the Notice to Appear.

2

If a federal criminal defendant demonstrates that his particular violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) involved distribution of “a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration,” 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) provides that the offense is to be “treated” for sentencing purposes as if it were simple possession, thereby transforming it into a federal misdemeanor punishable by no more than one year in prison. 21 U.S.C. § 844. According to the Federal Courts of Appeals, however, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) does not define the elements of a discrete offense; rather, it describes a “mitigating exception” to the otherwise-applicable 5-year statutory maximum specified by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D). United States v. Hamlin, 319 F.3d 666, 670-71 (4th Cir. 2003); United States v. Bartholomew, 310 F.3d 912, 925 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Walker, 302 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir. 2002); United States v. Outen, 286 F.3d 622, 638 (2d Cir. 2002). Hence, in the federal criminal context it is the defendant who must prove the additional facts (i.e., the “smallness” of the amount of marijuana and the absence of remuneration) that trigger the exception. A federal prosecutor who seeks a 5-year sentence against a marijuana distributor need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of marijuana distributed (or sought to be distributed) was “large” or that remuneration was present. Because 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) is an ameliorative sentencing provision that is unrelated to the elements of any federal drug offense, we conclude that 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) (and not 21 U.S.C. § 8410)(4)) is the proper federal analogue for a state marijuana distribution (or possession with intent to distribute) offense under the “hypothetical federal felony” approach.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Fawell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Yeung
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening, termination
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on December 7, 2005, when we summarily affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 19, 2005. In that decision the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable pursuant to sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), and (B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), as having been convicted of a controlled substance violation; and which he also found to been a conviction for an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), based on the respondent’s record of conviction (Group Exh. 2). Having found the respondent convicted of an aggravated felony under the Act, the Immigration Judge pretermitted his request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and ordered his removal to India (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen seeking to terminate his proceedings. The respondent requests reopening on the grounds that the conviction which forms the essential basis for the grounds of removal found by the Immigration Judge and his determination as to the respondent’s statutory ineligibility for relief, has now been vacated. The Board’s December 7, 2005, decision will be vacated, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and the issuance of a new decision.
 
The respondent has offered a certified copy of an order from the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit, DuPage County, Wheaton, Illinois, dated February 16, 2007, granting the respondent’s motion to vacate his plea of guilty as to his February 24, 2004, conviction in the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit, DuPage County, Wheaton, Illinois, for the offense of Unlawful Delivery of a Controlled Substance, to wit: Cocaine, in violation of section 570/401(c)(2) of chapter 720 of the ILCS. See Respondent’s Exh. “H.”
 
The Board in Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), held that if a court vacates a conviction based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings, there is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. See also Pickering v. Gonzales, 465 F.3d 263 (6th Cir. 2006) (To prove deportability, the government must produce evidence of a conviction that remains valid for immigration purposes, and in order to meet its burden, the government must prove, with clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent’s conviction was quashed solely for rehabilitative reasons or reasons related to his immigration status, i.e., to avoid adverse immigration consequences); Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 1125, 1130 (10th Cir. 2005). In rendering his vacatur order, the criminal court Judge found support for the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and determined that the respondent’s plea was tendered involuntarily and was violative of constitutional due process. See Sandoval v. I.N.S., 240 F.3d 577, 578-79 (7 th Cir. 2001) (court found under Illinois law, if a defendant enters a plea of guilty in reasonable reliance upon the erroneous advice of counsel that the defendant’s plea would have no collateral deportation consequence, reliance on this misleading advice can render the defendant’s plea involuntary, citing People v. Correa, 485 N.E.2d 307, 309-12 (1985), and People v. Luna, 570 N.E.2d 404, 406-07 (1991) (holding that post-conviction petition, which alleged that counsel failed to advise alien that a felony conviction could result in deportation, was sufficient to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel)).
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, acknowledges and accepts the Board’s holding in Pickering that a conviction vacated solely for rehabilitative reasons or to avoid adverse immigration consequences remains a conviction for immigration purposes. See Ali v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d 722, 728-729 (7th Cir. 2005); see also Gill v. Ashcroft, 335 F.3d 574, 578 (7th Cir.2003) (finding a state conviction dismissed pursuant to state rehabilitative statutory scheme, and not because of any procedural or substantive defect in the conviction, remained a conviction for immigration purposes). However, the Seventh Circuit concomitantly recognizes that where an alien’s conviction is vacated pursuant to a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, it may no longer constitute a conviction for immigration purposes. See Ali v. Ashcroft, supra at 729 (citing with approval its decision in Sandoval v. I.N.S., 240 F.3d 577, 584 (7th Cir. 2001) and BIA decisions cited therein to hold that an alien whose conviction had been modified because of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea stage did not remain convicted for immigration purposes).
 
Although the criminal court’s vacatur was issued pursuant to a post-conviction motion under the applicable statutes, the Seventh circuit has found that because the very purpose of the Illinois Post Conviction Hearing Act is to remedy constitutional violations in the underlying criminal proceedings, the Illinois scheme is not a state rehabilitative statute, so that it falls outside the category of statutes that would preserve a conviction for immigration purposes. Sandoval v. I.N.S., supra at 582-83. Therefore, there remains no dispute that the criminal court’s action in this case was premised upon what it perceived to be a constitutional infirmity in the underlying proceedings, rather than some form of rehabilitative post-conviction relief. See e.g., Rumierz v. Gonzales, 456 F.3d 31, 34-35(1st Cir. 2006) (a vacated conviction is no longer a “conviction” within the meaning of the immigration laws only “if a court with jurisdiction vacates ¿theº conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.”); see also Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (holding that a conviction vacated under Ohio Revised Code § 2943.031 for the trial court’s failure to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes) and Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378, 1379-80 (BIA 2000) (holding that a conviction vacated pursuant to Article 440 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law, which is neither an expungement statute nor a rehabilitative statute, did not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes); Matter of Pickering, supra at 624.
 
*3 Finally, the DHS has opposed the respondent’s motion on the grounds that it is untimely and that the respondent’s remaining 2004 conviction, for delivery of a “Look-alike” substance in violation of section 570/404(b) of chapter 720 of the ILCS, constitutes an “aggravated felony” within the meaning of the Act. See generally U.S. v. Robertson, 474 F. 3d 538 (8th Cir. 2007). However, the Immigration Judge expressly declined to consider this alternative theory of removability (I.J. at 3-4). Under these circumstances, and considering especially that the conviction underlying the outstanding order of removability has been vacated, the Board will exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen and remand for further proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s December 7, 2005, decision is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Socheat Chea, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Holya,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 18, 2006, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear at the hearing on April 2, 2003. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was issued on October 23, 2002, and personally served on the respondent on that date. Furthermore, the certificate of service on the Notice to Appear indicates that the respondent was provided oral notice in the Portuguese language of the consequences of a failure to appear, and it is signed by the respondent to acknowledge her receipt of it. See Exh. 1.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received notice of the hearing as required by section 239(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2). Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. Section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent received proper notice of the hearing, as it was mailed on November 25, 2002, to the most recent address provided by the respondent, and she acknowledges that she received it.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge failed to consider all of the evidence regarding the developments that occurred regarding notice to the respondent. She avers that her husband received a change of venue and his case was transferred to Atlanta, but the respondent’s case was not. The respondent states that she was told that venue for both of their cases had been changed, but the respondent has not provided any evidence that the Immigration Court provided her with such information, nor is there any evidence in the record that the respondent ever sought a change of venue to Atlanta, Georgia. The respondent also indicates that her husband was ordered removed in absentia, but the Immigration Judge subsequently granted his motion to reopen. The respondent has not provided a copy of the motion to reopen or the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding her husband’s case. Therefore, it is unknown on what basis his proceedings were reopened by the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent also argues that she never received a hearing notice from the Atlanta Immigration Court, which indicates the existence of a notice problem. However, the record does not reflect that the respondent ever filed a motion to change venue with the Phoenix Immigration Court requesting that her case be transferred to the Atlanta Immigration Court, nor that the Immigration Judge granted a motion to change venue. Consequently, the respondent’s case was never transferred to the Atlanta Immigration Court. Therefore, her argument regarding lack of notice from the Atlanta Immigration Court is without merit.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent asserts that subsequent to receiving the hearing notice from the Phoenix Immigration Court, she relied on information from an individual who spoke Portuguese, and who incorrectly informed her that her case was transferred to Atlanta. There is no indication that the respondent ever contacted the Phoenix Immigration Court regarding her scheduled hearing. The respondent’s reliance on an unknown individual’s incorrect advice that the respondent’s case had also been transferred to Atlanta does not constitute exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien’s late petition is the result of deceptive actions by a representative). Even if the respondent had alleged and established ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear, she failed to exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen her removal proceedings. See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Lopez v. INS, supra. She acknowledges receiving the notice of hearing, dated November 25, 2002, yet the respondent did not seek to determine the status of her removal proceedings and file a motion to reopen until July 3, 2006, over three years after she was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has failed to establish that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda A. Dominguez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal under section 240A; voluntary departure
 
The respondent has filed a timely1 appeal of the Immigration Judge’s written decision dated October 12, 2005, denying the respondent’s applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), and ordering him removed to the Ivory Coast. On appeal, the respondent argues that he suffered prejudice due to ineffective assistance of counsel. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent has submitted new evidence and has requested that his case be remanded to the Immigration Judge. The complete and well-written decision of the Immigration Judge will be affirmed, the respondent’s appeal dismissed, and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The respondent has failed to meet the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Most importantly, he has failed to show that he suffered prejudice resulting from his prior counsel’s conduct in regard to his claim of cancellation of removal. Exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen son has not been shown. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act; Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001) (hardship that is substantially beyond that ordinarily expected to result from removal from the United States).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has failed to show that he would have qualified for voluntary departure, and thus failed to show prejudice in that regard as well. Specifically, contrary to the respondent’s argument on his Notice of Appeal, the record before us does not contain a complete copy of a valid passport issued in the respondent’s name, and he has not provided a copy of such on appeal. Thus he has failed to show that he had the means to depart the United States, and he thus failed to qualify for voluntary departure. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(2). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States because she failed to appear for a hearing on March 12, 2002. She filed a motion to reopen on August 25, 2006, but an Immigration Judge denied the request on September 15, 2006. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she did not receive notice of her hearing from either the Immigration Court or her former attorney. The record reflects that on or about February 21, 2002, an attorney filed a Notice of Appearance on behalf of the respondent. We further note that the Immigration Court served former counsel with the Notice of Hearing advising counsel that the respondent’s hearing would be held on March 12, 2002 (See Exh. #2/Certificate of Service). In addition, the record contains a letter dated March 11, 2002, from former counsel indicating his request to withdraw as the respondent’s attorney. The motion to withdraw was not received by the Immigration Court until 3 days after the entry of the in absentia order of removal. Attached to that letter was a copy of the Notice of Hearing. We therefore conclude that the respondent’s former counsel had notice of the respondent’s hearing before the Immigration Court. A Notice of Hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5 and Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (1985). We therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the notice requirements were satisfied in these proceedings.
 
We have considered the respondent’s argument that her former attorney did not notify her of her hearing. However, the nature of the respondent’s argument involves attorney negligence. Such a claim is based on exceptional circumstances, and had to be filed within 180 days of the issuance date of the order of removal. See Mater of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998); section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It was not timely submitted, and the respondent’s request is therefore time-barred from consideration. We further note that the respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear and was aware that she was in removal proceedings. Inasmuch as more than four years elapsed before the respondent requested reopening, she has failed to pursue her claim with due diligence. Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267 (2d Cir. 2006); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006). See also Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133 (2nd Cir. 2007) (discussing the burden required for proving ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy A. Merriman,
Of Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated September 21, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ motion to reopen their removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondents filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record contains Forms I-826, Notice of Rights and Request for Disposition, for each of the respondents, in which they request a hearing before the Immigration Court, and which are also signed by each respondent on June 11, 2002. The record contains Forms I-213, Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, dated June 11, 2002, which reflects the respondents addresses as: 50 Wyoming Street, Buffalo, NY 14215. The Forms I-862, Notices to Appear (NTA) were mailed to the respondents at the above address on June 19, 2002, which ordered the respondents to appear at a removal hearing on August 21, 2002. The respondents failed to appear and an in absentia removal order was entered on that date.
 
In their August 15, 2006, motion to reopen, the respondents do not allege that they did not receive notice of their hearing. Instead, they aver that since they were attempting to immigrate to Canada, they were advised by the Red Cross not to appear at their hearing, and so they left prior to the removal hearing. On appeal, they contend that Viva Le Casa advised them to depart to Canada, and they indicate that they want their removal orders “removed” because they are now Canadian residents and they want to travel to the United States.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on August 21, 2002. There is no indication in the record that the respondents advised the Immigration Judge that they had departed the United States. The respondents failed to file their motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. To the extent they allege ineffective assistance of counsel (insofar as they were purportedly advised not to appear at their hearing), they have failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and re-affirmed in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements constitutes forfeiture of the ineffective assistance claim). Moreover, they have failed to show that they have been diligent since they purportedly discovered their removal orders in 2004.1 See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006)(court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

On appeal, the respondents maintain that it was only when their attorney in Canada reviewed their documents in 2004, that they realized they had a court date in August 2002. This claim is nonsensical, because if they had documents in their possession which reflected the 2002 hearing date, they obviously received notice of their hearing or the removal order. Consequently, they should have been aware of their hearing. This statement is also inconsistent with their other averment that they were advised by the Red Cross (or Viva Le Casa) not to appear at their hearing.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
*1 This case is before us on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Pursuant to a joint motion to remand, in its November 14, 2006, unpublished decision, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the Board. Upon further consideration, the Board again declines to reopen proceedings in this case.
 
The respondent is from Mexico. On October 20, 1993, in California, he was convicted of sale/transportation/offer to sell heroin. On May 22, 2001, the respondent was convicted of possession of heroin in California. On January 10, 2002, an Immigration Judge found that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was ineligible for relief from removal. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely on August 29, 2003.
 
On October 14, 2005, the Board issued an order which found that the respondent had not submitted a proper motion to reopen on June 14, 2005, as it contained no legal argument, but rather had presented several “Attachments”, including the respondent’s affidavit.
 
On January 20, 2006, the Board considered a reconsideration motion filed by the respondent. The Board reconsidered the reasons for the earlier denial of the motion to reopen, based on the explanation that the respondent’s attorney’s office made a clerical error in omitting the actual motion to reopen. Upon reconsideration, however, the motion to reopen was again denied. The Board found that, despite blaming former counsel for filing an untimely appeal, the respondent failed to show diligence in bringing his claims.
 
In any event, the Board found, the respondent failed to show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s actions. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Board noted that the Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for relief from removal based on his conviction of an aggravated felony. The motion to reopen argued that the respondent was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) concerning the 1993 conviction, which would then allow him to pursue cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, at pp. 10-12).
 
The Board’s January 20, 2006, decision found that this contention was incorrect. The United States Supreme Court held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to aliens who pled guilty to offenses prior to April 24, 1996. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). The respondent was found to have committed an aggravated felony based on his 2001 conviction for possession of heroin, after a previous conviction, and relief under 212(c) of the Act was therefore unavailable even under that court ruling.
 
*2 The joint motion to remand, approved by the Ninth Circuit, states that the Board is to “consider¿º whether, in connection with a proper analysis of a controlled substance violation precluding relief, including but not limited to consideration of properly noticed documents, ¿the respondentº has shown prejudice sufficient to support ¿the respondent’sº claim of ineffective assistance of counsel” (case citations omitted).
 
As the Board noted in its January 20, 2006, decision, the respondent was convicted in 2001 for possession of heroin, after a previous conviction. The respondent’s 2001 conviction for possession of heroin was preceded by the 1993 heroin conviction, so the 2001 heroin possession conviction is an aggravated felony under federal law. See 21 U.S.C. § 844(a); Lopez v. Gonzales, __ U.S. __, 127 S.Ct. 625 (U.S. 2006). The 2001 crime is not subject to a section 212(c) waiver under INS v. St. Cyr, supra, as it was committed long after April 24, 1996. Moreover, as the respondent was convicted of the aggravated felony in 2001, he is not eligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(a) of the Act.
 
Additionally, even if a section 212(c) waiver was potentially available concerning the 1993 narcotics conviction, it would not eliminate the existence of that conviction and its ability to render the 2001 conviction an aggravated felony. See Becker v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 1000, 1003-04 (9th Cir. 2007) (“… the grant of section 212(c) relief merely waives the finding of deportability rather than the basis of the deportability itself. Therefore, the crimes alleged to be grounds for deportability do not disappear from the alien’s record for immigration purposes”). Therefore, as the Board stated in its January 20, 2006, decision, the respondent is ineligible for relief under section 212(c) of the Act, as well as section 240A(a) of the Act, and the respondent has not shown prejudice regarding alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: As set out in the joint remand motion approved by the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2006, we have given further consideration to the respondent’s motion to reopen, and find that it should again be denied. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
By a decision dated January 22, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen his immigration proceedings. The respondent has filed a timely appeal of that decision. On appeal, the respondent avers that this Board should apply equitable tolling to the numerical limitations on motions to reopen in order for him to seek redress for his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally section 240(c)(6)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion. We have reviewed the record of proceedings, the Immigration Judge’s decision, and the arguments advanced on appeal. Upon consideration of the totality of the factors presented in this case, we will adjudicate the instant motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1134-36 (BIA 1999). See Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL 627822 (Feb. 27, 2007). Moreover, given the circumstances, we find that the reopening of the respondent’s proceedings is warranted. See, e.g., Respondent’s’Brief, sub-exh. D; cf. I.J. Dec. (Sept. 18, 2006) at 2. See generally Motion to Reopen (Dec. 7, 2006), sub-exhs. A and F.
 
With regard to the DHS’s argument that the respondent is precluded from seeking adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), as a result of his failure to voluntarily depart from the United States, we disagree. There is no evidence to suggest that the respondent ever posted the voluntary departure bond required by section 240B(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(3). See generally I.J. Dec. (Sept. 18, 2006) at 3. Assuming arguendo that the respondent did not pay the bond by September 25, 2006, his alternate order of removal would have taken effect at that time and he would still be eligible to seek adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3); Matter of Diaz-Ruacho, 24 I&N Dec. 47 (BIA 2006).
 
*2 Accordingly, we find it appropriate to grant the respondent’s motion and remand the matter to the Immigration Court. In the remanded proceedings, the parties will be provided with an opportunity to present additional evidence relevant to the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status, including testimony and documentary materials.
 
In view of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shan D. Potts, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 25, 1997, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s September 9, 1996, decision finding the respondent ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
On January 17, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen seeking the opportunity to apply for 212(c) relief. A special motion to reopen for 212(c) relief must have been filed on or before April 26, 2005. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(h). The respondent’s motion was filed over one year after the deadline. Although it appears that the respondent is eligible for 212(c) relief, his motion will be denied because it was not timely filed.
 
We also find the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel that would warrant equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen under 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.44(h). See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003) (no claim for ineffective assistance where an alien was unable to demonstrate both a deprivation of due process and resulting prejudice). Nothing in the record demonstrates that the respondent was actually deprived of due process. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985) (ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process “if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case”).
 
The respondent asserts an ineffective assistance claim against both his prior attorneys: Ms. Gloria Weil-Herrera, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and the Board, and Mr. George A. Verdin, who represented him in bond proceedings. The respondent asserts that Ms. Weil-Herrera failed to inform him of our September 25, 1997, order, and, consequently, he was precluded from filing a motion to reopen and seeking judicial review. See Respondent’s Motion at 7. The respondent asserts that Mr. Verdin failed to keep him informed of further 212(c) developments. Id. at 8. According to the respondent’s declaration, he obtained a copy of his file in 2006 and eventually obtained current counsel to file a motion to reopen. See Motion to Reopen, Attachment at 3 (respondent’s declaration in support of his motion).
 
We find that the respondent has failed to exercise due diligence in his case such that he warrants the equitable tolling of the motions deadlines. Even if, as he asserts, Ms. Weil-Herrera failed to notify him of our September 25, 1997, decision, the respondent failed to take any action whatsoever to check the status of his case for nearly 10 years. According to the respondent, he was on notice that Ms. Weil-Herrera could not be relied upon since by December 1996, just two months after his hearing, he had to retain Mr. Verdin because he was unable to contact Ms. Weil-Herrera. See Motion to Reopen, Attachment 2 (respondent’s declaration in support of his motion). The respondent also states that Ms. Weil-Herrera did not advise him to file for any other form of relief from deportation, but he fails to assert or establish that he was prima facie eligible for any other form of relief at the time of his September 9, 1996, deportation hearing. Additionally, the respondent knew from Mr. Verdin that his case was pending with the Board, and he did nothing to check the status of his case. Based on the respondent’s own assertions, he has failed to establish that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his case.
 
*2 Regarding his claim against Mr. Verdin, who assisted him in bond proceedings in December 1996, the respondent does not claim that he made any effort during the following 10 years to contact Mr. Verdin regarding the status of his case. See Motion to Reopen, Attachment 1-3 (respondent’s declaration in support of his motion). He does not claim to have checked in regularly with Mr. Verdin or that he kept Mr. Verdin appraised of his address. Nor does he provide any evidence of the contractual duties owed him by Mr. Verdin. The respondent, who knew he was deportation proceedings, had a duty to diligently pursue his immigration case. Yet, according to his own statement, he did not do anything for about 10 years. Based on the respondent’s own statement and assertions, we find that his case does not warrant equitable tolling where he failed to exercise due diligence. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as untimely filed.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur A. Campomanes, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s September 6, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s counsel’s request for a continuance for filing of a new I-130 visa petition, and ordering the respondent removed to the Philippines. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s counsel’s request for a continuance after determining that the respondent had abandoned a visa petition that had been filed on her behalf and that she did not have, at the time of the hearing, an approved, or even pending, visa petition (I.J. at 2).1 One of the pre-requisites to qualify for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), is that the alien demonstrate that an immigrant visa is immediately available to him or her at the time that the application is filed. See Matter of Garcia, 16 I&N Dec. 653, 654 (BIA 1978). In the present case, it is an established, undisputed fact that, at the time of the hearing, no immigrant visa was immediately available to the respondent, as there was no approved, or even pending, visa petition. The respondent has merely argued, unpersuasively, that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion for continuance was erroneous and constituted a due process violation. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-5. We disagree. An Immigration Judge, in his or her discretion, may grant a motion for a continuance for good cause shown. Good cause is not demonstrated by requesting a continuance to await the results of a collateral event, which may occur at some indefinite time in the future, and the outcome of which may or may not be favorable to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). We find that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the respondent’s motion for a continuance in this case because, at the time of the hearing, the respondent was statutorily ineligible to adjust status.
 
This Board finds puzzling, as well as troublesome, the respondent’s unfounded suggestion, through counsel, of bias and/or misconduct by the Immigration Judge, claiming that the Immigration Judge “seemed more interested in finding a justification to deport her rather than finding out the facts in her situation and giving her an opportunity to seek an available relief.” See Respondent’s Brief at 4. We have found no evidence in the record of any bias or misconduct by the Immigration Judge. This Board also notes that the respondent has suggested, through counsel, that she received ineffective assistance from her prior counsel, who allegedly failed to appeal the October 2001 denial of a visa application that was reportedly filed on her behalf by her husband. See Notice of Appeal, attachment; Tr. at 15-16, 24; see also Respondent’s Brief, Exh. B. The respondent, however, has failed to set forth a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because she has not met the minimum requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), petition for review denied, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2007). The respondent also seems to have implied, through counsel, that the burden to prove ineffective assistance of counsel is on the government. See Respondent’s Brief at 4. A simple reading of Lozada reveals that that is not the case. We also find unpersuasive the respondent’s unsupported and unconvincing argument on appeal that the Immigration Judge “erred in compelling the respondent to be a witness against herself on … fraud allegations.” See Respondent’s Brief at 5.
 
*2 Finally, this Board acknowledges the argument and evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal suggesting that a visa application, purportedly filed by the respondent’s current husband after the hearing in this case, has already been approved. See Respondent’s Brief at 5, and its Exhs. B and D. Even if actual proof of the approval of a visa petition had been submitted, the dismissal of this appeal would nevertheless stand, as the respondent’s appeal is limited to the question of whether the Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion for a continuance was appropriate. Any subsequent filing and approval of a visa petition of which the respondent is the beneficiary is clearly irrelevant for purposes of this appeal.2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

At the hearing, the Department of Homeland Security informed the Court that the respondent’s first husband, Peter Butler, had filed a visa petition on behalf of the respondent, but that that petition was denied by the government on May 25, 2000. See Tr. at 2. The respondent’s counsel confirmed this fact, as well as the fact that a second visa petition, filed by the respondent’s current husband, Gilbert Geronimo, had been denied as well, in October 2001. See Tr. at 12-13. The respondent’s counsel also acknowledged at the hearing that no further action had been taken since the October 2001 denial, but that Mr. Geronimo intended to file a new visa petition on behalf of the respondent. See Tr. at 13, 16.

The present dismissal of the respondent’s appeal does not preclude her from filing an application to adjust status in the future, provided she has evidence of the alleged approval of a visa petition filed on her behalf.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antoinette J. Rizzi, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status, remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Morocco. On June 13, 2005, we reinstated proceedings, due to a finding of prior ineffective assistance of counsel, thus, the respondent’s appeal will now be adjudicated on the merits. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 1, 2004, decision. The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by failing to grant an additional continuance and by failing to administratively close proceedings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to remand will be denied. However, the respondent will be given the privilege of voluntarily departing.
 
The respondent acknowledges that he was granted three different continuances, over a period of 1 year, in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status and additionally for the pursuit of a motion to reopen and reconsider the denial of the I-140 petition and the I-485 application. The record reflects that the I-140 petition was denied due to the inability of the employer/petitioner to establish the ability to pay the proffered wage or salary. The respondent, in a reply (dated January 14, 2005) to a response concerning an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, acknowledged that the attorney Hadeed did inform the employer/petitioner of a request for further information about the ability to pay the proffered wage. There is a letter, dated December 3, 2004, from May Shallal Kheder, indicating that, prior to the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s order dated April 1, 2004, the respondent’s first motion to reopen and reconsider the I-140 denial was also denied. Such letter also indicates that the respondent quit working for the petitioner. Such letter further indicates that the employer/petitioner later decided not to continue to pursue the I-140 petition. We find that the respondent failed to adequately establish good cause for a fourth continuance on April 1, 2004. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see also Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987) (noting that a decision to deny a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing). There is insufficient evidence that the I-140 or I-485 were prima facie approvable at the time of the respondent’s April 1, 2004, hearing.
 
*2 Furthermore, we do not find that the respondent has established that the Immigration Judge erred by failing to administratively close his proceedings. The respondent admits that both parties did not agree to the administrative closure of this case. We have long held that an Immigration Judge may not grant administrative closure where it is opposed by either party. See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 480 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lopez-Barrios, 20 I&N Dec. 203 (BIA 1990). The respondent asks that we revisit and reconsider our holding in Matter of Lopez-Barrios, supra. However, we decline to do so at this time.
 
The respondent has requested that we remand the record so that he may pursue a second I-140 petition. However, we note that such petition and supporting documentation, which the respondent indicates are attached to the appellate brief, are not in fact attached to such-brief and are not in the record. Hence, as there is insufficient evidence that the pending I-140 is prima facie approvable, the respondent’s motion to remand is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 90 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on September 22, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s May 6, 2005, decision. The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), because the respondent’s conviction for second degree sexual abuse by a jury trial does not fall within the ambit of the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); and the respondent’s conviction for an offense constituting an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A), has no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a).
 
On March 28, 2007, the respondent filed the instant untimely motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance claim against his prior attorney, Ms. Erin Hall. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). A final order was entered in this case on September 22, 2005.
 
Because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
Although the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has failed to establish that his case was prejudiced as a result of Ms. Hall’s conduct. Nor is it clear that Ms. Hall’s assistance was ineffective.
 
We recognize that the respondent’s motion is supported by new evidence which was not submitted to the Immigration Judge, namely, a transcript of the respondent’s April 15, 1989, sentencing proceeding in the Circuit Court of the County of Multnomah, in Portland Oregon. The respondent submits this document to establish that although he was convicted at trial, he relied on the availability of 212(c) relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h) (aliens are not eligible to apply for 212(c) relief with respect to convictions entered after trial). However, the proffered evidence would not necessarily alter the result in this case. To date, in the Ninth Circuit, wherein this case arises, an alien who is convicted at trial is not eligible for section 212(c) relief. See Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121-22 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 902 (2003). Although Ms. Hall did not submit this transcript to the Immigration Judge, she submitted a memorandum of law arguing the respondent’s 212(c) eligibility even though he was convicted at trial.
 
*2 Even if the respondent could establish his 212(c) eligibility despite the fact that he was convicted at trial, he is ineligible for a 212(c) waiver because his aggravated felony conviction lacks a comparable ground of inadmissibility. See Matter of Blake, 23 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 2005). In his motion, the respondent asserts that Ms. Hall should have argued that the facts of his case are different from those in Matter of Blake, supra. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment ER-8 (Bar Complaint to the Washington State Bar). The respondent also asserts that Ms. Hall should have argued that Blake was wrongly decided. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment ER-5 at 39-44 (Respondent’s Brief filed with the Ninth Circuit). Ms. Hall’s failure to raise these particular arguments did not prejudice the respondent’s case. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (counsel’s actions must have rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair such that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case). Under the principles enunciated in Matter of Blake, supra, and Matter of Brieva, 23 I&N Dec. 766 (BIA 2005), the respondent’s aggravated felony conviction lacks a comparable ground of inadmissibility, and he is ineligible for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act. We find no reason to disturb those decisions.
 
Accordingly, we find that the respondent has failed to present a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carol H. Sloss, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reconsider our decision dated February 8, 2007. Our prior decision summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to provide specific reasons in his Notice Of Appeal for challenging the Immigration Court’s decision, and failure to submit a separate brief or statement in support of the appeal when he checked a box on the Notice Of Appeal indicating his intent to do so. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A) and (E). The respondent’s motion to reopen is based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Initially, we find that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that are set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The record shows that the respondent’s appeal brief was due on September 21, 2006. On September 19, 2006, former counsel attempted to file a motion to withdraw as the respondent’s representative, but the motion was denied because former counsel failed to provide the respondent’s last known address.1 The respondent’s current motion states that former counsel attempted to withdraw as his representative “because counsel had been continually unable to contact Respondent for several months” (Motion at 3). On October 11, 2006, former counsel filed a new Entry of Appearance As Attorney and requested an extension of time to file an appeal brief. The briefing extension request was denied as untimely because it was filed after the September 21, 2006, filing deadline originally set by the Board. An appeal brief filed by former counsel on November 13, 2006, was also rejected as untimely.
 
The facts presented in the respondent’s motion do not reflect that former counsel was negligent or otherwise ineffective in representing the respondent. According to the chronology outlined in the respondent’s motion, former counsel was unable to contact the respondent despite repeated efforts to do so, and finally attempted to withdraw as the respondent’s representative. The respondent has not identified any action or inaction of former counsel that caused the rejection of his untimely brief and the dismissal of his appeal. We can only conclude that the dismissal of the respondent’s appeal resulted solely from the respondent’s own failure to maintain communication and assist his former attorney with the preparation of his appeal. Under the circumstances, the respondent has not shown that any prejudice resulted from the representation of his former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion is defective, insofar as it requests reconsideration of our prior order, because it fails to identify any legal or factual errors in our previous decision that warrant reconsideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul A. Schelly, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey D. Clark,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is dismissed. The respondent appealed from the January 10, 2007, oral decision of the Immigration Judge, which found him removable; determined that he did not establish eligibility for cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, or any other relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Mexico. A reply brief was submitted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) on March 30, 2007.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusions regarding the respondent’s removability and ineligibility for relief. The Immigration Judge properly found the respondent removable as charged, pursuant to sections 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), and 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), and 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The record reflects that the respondent was convicted on May 31, 1996, of possession for sale of a controlled substance, namely cocaine, under California law. We note that this conviction is for a drug trafficking offense that is both an aggravated felony and a particularly serious crime. See Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, and R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002). The respondent stated that he did not have a fear of persecution or torture from governmental authorities in his native country of Mexico (Tr. at 10).
 
On appeal, the respondent suggests that he is eligible for cancellation of removal, asserting that he arrived in the United States in 1992 rather than the April 2004 date listed on the Notice to Appear. Consistent with the DHS’s appellate position, the respondent is ineligible for both cancellation of removal and voluntary departure due to his aggravated felony conviction, regardless of whether he arrived in this country in 1992 or 2004. See sections 240A(b)(1)(C) and 240B(b)(1)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b)(1)(C) and 1229c(b)(1)(C).
 
Finally, the respondent alleges on the Notice of Appeal (“NTA”) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent indicates that he himself filed the NTA after his attorney did not do so. With respect to this ineffective assistance claim, which is in remand posture, we note that the respondent has not satisfied any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has not forwarded an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement between himself and his attorney; has not shown that the attorney whose competence is being impugned has been informed of the respondent’s allegations against him and has been given an opportunity to respond; and has not communicated whether he has filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities against the attorney. See also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance claim and that a complaint letter to the California State Bar with the notation “cc” to opposing counsel does not satisfy the requirement). We also do not find that a remand is warranted in light of Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance). We observe that, even assuming the respondent’s Lozada compliance, he has not established that he is eligible for any relief from removal. To the extent that the respondent contends that his removal hearing was unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in conducting the hearing. We also find that the respondent has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would constitute a due process violation. See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 415 (9th Cir. 2006).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Termination
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The record establishes that on July 1, 2004, the respondent was convicted in the Circuit Court of Broward County, Florida, of the offenses of: (a) attempted sexual battery in violation of Florida Statutes (F.S.) §§ 777.04 and 797.011(5); and (b) tampering with a witness, in violation of F.S. § 914.22; and he received a sentence of two years incarceration (I.J. at 1-2; Exh. 2). The respondent appeals an Immigration Judge’s February 7, 2007, decision finding that his conviction for tampering with a witness constitutes an aggravated felony, as defined in section 101(a)(43)(S) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S), to wit, an offense relating to the obstruction of justice for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge further found that the respondent failed to demonstrate his eligibility for any form of relief from removal (I.J. at 3). The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he may not be removed because he has a criminal appeal pending. However, the record establishes that the respondent’s appeal of his criminal conviction was dismissed (Tr. at 2, 11, 17-18; Exh. 3, Appendix G). We acknowledge that the respondent has filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus with the District Court of Appeal for the Fourth District of Florida, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his criminal appeal (Exh. 3, Appendix E). In this regard, we have held that an alien who has exhausted his right to a direct appeal of his criminal conviction is subject to deportation for that conviction, and that the potential for further discretionary review will not affect the finality of the conviction for the purpose of immigration proceedings. See Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994). Therefore, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to consider the respondent’s conviction final for purposes of these immigration proceedings. Moreover, the respondent has identified no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that his conviction for tampering with a witness constitutes an aggravated felony, or asserted that he is eligible for any type of relief from removal (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 12).
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aria Shariati, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(G)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii)º - Failed to fulfill marital agreement (withdrawn)
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status (withdrawn)
 
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Remand; adjustment of status
 
In a decision dated November 16, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance in order to continue processing an application for adjustment of status; she ordered the respondent removed to Syria. The Immigration Judge had previously granted the respondent numerous continuances in order to await processing of a labor certification required in order to qualify for adjustment of status, but after nearly 3 years had passed, she declined to hold the case in abeyance any longer. The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge made procedural and substantive errors and requests a remand which will be granted. His request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2006).
 
The respondent raises the question of which charging document applies to his case, although for reasons relating to his eligibility for asylum and not to challenge his removability (Respondent’s Br. at 25-27; see also Respondent’s Br. at 28 (arguing he was denied a fair hearing)). The respondent was originally charged under sections 237(a)(1)(G)(ii) and 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii), 1227(a)(1)(C)(i), although these charges were withdrawn by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and substituted with a charge under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (Tr. at 2; see Exhs. 1 & 2). The respondent later conceded to removability — we presume — under the section 212 charge (Tr. at 6). However, the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 16, 2005, lists only the section 237 charges in the heading and appears to have found the respondent removable under the section 237 charges; the Immigration Judge notes that exhibit 2 — the lodged 212 charge — was not pled to (I.J. at 2; see Tr. at 32). We find it necessary to remand proceedings in order to obtain a more accurate picture of the respondent’s removability. As the respondent correctly points out, which charging document is sustained affects the respondent’s eligibility for relief, although we note that his failure to file an asylum application belies his claim that he was prevented from filing one due to confusion in the charging documents about when he arrived here. At any rate, he is correct that if he conceded the charges in the original Notice to Appear, he would be time-barred from applying for asylum; if he conceded to the lodged charge, he would be ineligible for adjustment of status. See Eligibility of Arriving Aliens in Removal Proceedings to Apply for Adjustment of Status and Jurisdiction to Adjudicate Applications for Adjustment of Status, 71 Fed. Reg. 27,585-592 (May 12, 2006). Furthermore, he cannot have conceded to both of the charging documents as they present different facts about when the respondent arrived and whether he was admitted.
 
*2 The issue of removability is also related to the respondent’s other claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, various procedural due process claims, and his claim that the Immigration Judge erred in finding him ineligible for adjustment of status. First, with regard to the respondent’s claim that he was not adequately represented by his three previous attorneys, all apparently from the same law firm, we can find no basis to remand. We note that the respondent has submitted a supplemental filing which indicates that he has complied with most of the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).1
 
However, we are not able to determine that he suffered prejudice by his attorneys’ actions. He alleges that his former attorneys never investigated the manner in which the respondent was arrested and that, due to the illegality of the arrest, all evidence obtained should be have suppressed (Respondent’s Br. at 21-22). He also argues that former counsel never presented proper evidence of the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status (Respondent’s Br. at 22-24). The respondent does not specify what evidence should have been suppressed and it is unclear how his arrest by United States Marshals necessarily affects his removability. However, to the extent he wishes to revisit this issue, he may state his claim before the Immigration Judge on remand and can revisit the issue of eligibility for relief as well. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600, 601 (BIA 1978) (noting that with certain exceptions, the remand of a case by this Board is effective for not only the stated purpose of the remand, but also for consideration of any and all matters which the Immigration Judge deems appropriate). We decline, however, at this time to find that he was subjected to ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has failed to establish that his arrest was illegal or that the manner in which he was arrested provided a basis for terminating proceedings. With regard to his attorneys’ attempt to aid the respondent in gaining relief from removal, there was no approved labor certification which was necessary for the respondent to adjust his status based on an employment-related visa petition. The respondent has failed to establish that his former counsels’ acts prejudiced him.
 
We also decline to find error in the Immigration Judge’s decision not to grant yet another continuance, although, again, our remand, in effect, provides the respondent with a continued proceeding and, therefore, with the result he seeks. As we have stated before, granting a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, and her decision denying such a motion will not be reversed on appeal unless the alien establishes, by a full and specific articulation of the particular facts involved or evidence which he would have presented, that the denial caused him actual prejudice and harm, and materially affected the outcome of his case. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Here, the respondent had already been granted several continuances and there remained no evidence that the respondent was eligible for any relief other than voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge properly denied the request for what amounted to an indefinite request to continue proceedings.
 
*3 We note the respondent’s argument that a continuance was warranted in order to allow his current attorney, who was, at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, new to the case, an opportunity to prepare himself and become familiar with the record of proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 27-28; Tr. at 26). Relatedly, he asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in applying San Francisco local operating rules (the Immigration Judge hailed from that area) while sitting in the Los Angeles immigration court (Respondent’s Br. at 31-32). According to the respondent, previous counsel did not formally withdraw from representing him and should have been present at the hearing; the Immigration Judge’s decision without their presence allegedly violated procedural due process (Respondent’s Br. at 32; see Tr. at 30). We find any error to be harmless because Los Angeles local operating procedures (like the San Francisco rules) specifically state that substitution of counsel is allowed where the request is made orally or in writing by the attorney to be substituted. This was done (Exh. 16).
 
ORDER: The record of proceedings is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to clarify the charges of removability and to allow the respondent to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.

Matter of Lozada requires that a motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must provide evidence (1) setting forth in detail the agreement entered into between client and counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion to remand or reopen reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. While the respondent has provided evidence that complied with the first and third requirements, we are unable to determine whether he has informed former counsel of the allegations.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on September 2, 2005. In a motion that was originally received on March 2, 2007, the respondent requested reopening of the proceedings. The respondent alleges in the motion, among other things, that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The motion, which is untimely, will be denied.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or by September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The pending motion was therefore untimely filed, and there is no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he or she has acted with due diligence. See Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 2005); Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent’s actions do not evidence diligence, as he has not explained why he failed to complain about the assistance of Marc Wigul in a timely manner. Mr. Wigul filed a notice of appearance (Form EOIR-27) on August 19, 2005, after the respondent himself had filed his appeal form. An associate of Mr. Wigul’s, Cindy C. Yu, filed an EOIR-27 on August 19, 2005, and submitted an appellate brief on the respondent’s behalf, although we considered Mr. Wigul still the attorney of record, for purposes of service of our order. In any event, the respondent’s explanation of his complaint against Mr. Wigul’s representation indicates that he had tactical differences with his attorney, which does not necessarily constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º
 
Although the respondent also asserts that he was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel from Robin Carr, Ms. Carr never filed an EOIR-27 with the Board and was never the attorney of record in this case. Any legal assistance provided by Ms. Carr, in regard to a petition for review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit would, in any event, be beyond our jurisdiction to consider.¿FN2º
 
Even had the motion been timely filed, we would decline to address the first two issues presented in the motion, since the respondent was not charged with removability as an aggravated felon on account of his conviction for wilful cruelty to a child, and he has presented no evidence that the Ninth Circuit has held, since the Immigration Judge issued his decision, that a violation under section 2800.2 of the California Vehicle Code would not be a crime involving moral turpitude.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied, as is the request for a stay of removal.

In a letter dated May 24, 2006, the California State Bar informed Mr. Wigul that there were insufficient grounds for disciplinary action, in regard to a complaint that the respondent had apparently filed.

In his explanation regarding Ms. Carr’s representation, the respondent curiously states that “On July 2005 ¿sicº I hired Ms. Robin Carr” to represent him in his appeal. Since Mr. Wigul submitted his EOIR-27 in June 2005, and his associate, Ms. Yu, submitted hers in August 2005, it is unclear why Ms. Carr would have failed to submit a formal notice of representation, if she in fact was retained a month after Mr. Wigul filed his notice.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gregory Olive, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reissuance of Board decision; stay of deportation
 
This case was last before us on November 1, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s February 23, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings against him. On February 15, 2007, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen, including a request to stay his deportation, based on his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance in representing him at the administrative level. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006). In the alternative, the respondent moves for a reissuance of this Board’s prior decision due to his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance in failing to timely file a petition for review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Department of Homeland Security has filed no opposition or other response to this motion, and the motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion will be granted in part, and denied in part.
 
The respondent concedes that his motion to reopen is untimely; however, he asserts that equitable tolling applies based on the ineffective assistance he received from his former counsel, Robert F. Jacobs. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and upheld in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We surmise that the respondent argues he should be excused from full compliance with the requirements for presenting an ineffective assistance claim under Lozada because the ineffective assistance is clear on the face of the record. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (involving former counsel who failed to file a timely brief before the Board). We disagree. Although the respondent has complied with the first two Lozada requirements, he has not complied with the third requirement, to wit, indicating that a bar complaint has been filed against Mr. Jacobs. “This requirement ensures a certain level of seriousness in the assertion of such charges and ‘highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings.”’ Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 825 (quoting Lozada, supra, at 639). Ordinarily, failure to comply with all of the Lozada requirements can be fatal to an alien’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that rigid compliance is not always necessary). We consider this third requirement crucial in discerning a legitimate claim of ineffective assistance from the numerous, baseless claims of ineffective assistance filed with the Board. In Rojas-Garcia, the court found that the claim for ineffective assistance was not fatal because: (1) the ineffective assistance was obvious from the face of the record; and (2) the alien had substantially complied with Lozada since his former counsel self-reported his defective representation to the bar. Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 825-26. Here, the respondent has not met either of these factors because there is no indication of a bar complaint either by the respondent or Mr. Jacobs, and there is no patent ineffective assistance of counsel at the administrative level.1 Therefore, his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel in support of the motion to reopen must fail.
 
*2 We find that even if the respondent had complied with Lozada, he has not established that Mr. Jacobs’ representation at the administrative level was ineffective. The respondent contends that Mr. Jacobs provided ineffective assistance at the administrative level when he did not object to the admission of the smugglee’s statements, and did not submit affidavits or witness testimony from the respondent’s family members to corroborate his story. As evidenced by Mr. Jacobs’ response to questions posed by the respondent’s current counsel, he made a tactical decision to not object to the smugglee’s statements hoping to highlight both internal and external inconsistencies. See Attachment to Motion “February 14, 2007 Letter from Mr. Jacobs.” Although there were inconsistences, as the Immigration Judge’s and our prior decision confirmed, the unmistakable similarities between the smugglee’s and the respondent’s statements regarding the essential elements of the smuggling scheme discredited the respondent’s version of the events at the hearing. Moreover, the Immigration Judge explained how the respondent’s own testimony was replete with implausibilities, inconsistencies, and thereby not credible (I.J. at 2-12; compare Tr. at 10 (sole purpose was to pick up son-in-law’s mother) with Tr. at 19-20 (purpose of trip was to also pick up smugglee and stating he was told to pick up the smugglee 8 days prior to the date he picked her up) with Exh. 2 (respondent’s Record of Sworn Statement). Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds to reopen. See Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (absent a showing of egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney is binding on the alien). Regarding the failure to submit affidavits from family members, Mr. Jacobs attempted to obtain such affidavits, including witness testimony, and advised the respondent of their necessity. See “February 14, 2007 Letter from Mr. Jacobs.” In addition, Mr. Jacobs advised the respondent that he should obtain proof such as telephone records, the flight itinerary of his son-in-law’s mother, declarations, and a doctor’s letter stating the mother was too ill to travel that day. Id. The respondent’s failure to obtain any of this evidence or produce any witnesses on his behalf is not attributable to Mr. Jacobs. Although the respondent has submitted documents purporting to be affidavits with this motion, he has not shown how these were unobtainable at the time of his merits hearing; in addition, the respondent has not provided any new evidence which would corroborate even one version of his story. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). ‘Therefore, the respondent has not shown patent or latent ineffective assistance by Mr. Jacobs in his representation at the administrative level, and there exists no good cause to reopen these proceedings.
 
*3 We now turn to the respondent’s motion to reissue our prior decision based on Mr. Jacobs’ ineffective assistance in failing to file a timely petition for review in the Ninth Circuit. We emphasize that any such ineffective assistance is based on Mr. Jacobs’ representation before the Ninth Circuit, and does not implicate any action by the Immigration Judge or the Board. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b), (c). Nonetheless; the Ninth Circuit has found that such ineffective assistance necessitates that the Board reissue a decision to allow an alien to then timely file an appeal in that forum. See Dearinger ex. rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (9th Cir. 2000) (upholding a district court decision ordering the Board to reissue its decision where counsel filed a petition for review 1 day late). Although the respondent has not complied with Lozada to bring an ineffective assistance claim within the scope of the Board’s authority, based on the Dearinger holding and the appellate court’s de novo review of such claims, we find that Mr. Jacobs’ failure to file a petition for review would constitute ineffective assistance before the Ninth Circuit, thereby raising a rebuttable presumption of prejudice. See Dearinger ex. rel. Volkova v. Reno, supra, at 1045. Accordingly, we will grant the motion to reissue.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied, and the request for stay of deportation is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 1, 2006, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

Mr. Jacobs’ failure to file a petition for review in the Ninth Circuit has no bearing on the analysis of his representation at the administrative level. However, we will revisit such failure in our discussion of the respondent’s motion to reissue our prior decision.

IN RE: SOON WOO SEO

April 25, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mathew L. Millen, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F..R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated October 26, 2006. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent was ordered removed from the United States because she failed to appear for a hearing on May 16, 2006. She filed a motion to reopen, but the Immigration Judge denied the request on July 28, 2006. That decision was appealed to the Board, but it was dismissed on October 26, 2006. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen on March 21, 2007. Therein, the respondent argues that these proceedings should be reopened based on “exceptional circumstances” causing her failure to appear. According to the respondent, she was the victim of negligence by her prior counsel who did not adequately advise her of the obligation to appear for her hearing on May 16, 2006. See also Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 2007 WL 1113912 (5th Cir. April 16, 2007).
 
The instant motion to reopen was filed with the Board more than 90 days after the date in which the final administrative decision by the Board was rendered on October 26, 2006. It is therefore untimely and is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We have also determined that the exceptions to these filing requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3) are inapplicable. In addition, 8 C.F.R. §1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Board should equitably toll the time and number requirements for reopening an order of removal entered in absentia based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir. 2000). In the instant case, the respondent indicates in her declaration that she was aware of her hearing. She states that she contacted her former attorney who told her that it should be okay if he represented her at the May 16, 2006, hearing by telephone. The respondent further indicates that former counsel did not instruct her to appear for the hearing, and implies that he may have even told her to not appear. See Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 2007 WL 1113912 (5th Cir. April 16, 2007). Even if such conduct was negligent, we note that the respondent’s current attorney represented her on appeal with the Board and filed a brief on her behalf. Current counsel should therefore have been familiar with the facts of the respondent’s case at the time, and clearly had the opportunity to discuss the case with the respondent within 90 days of the Board’s prior decision. Under these circumstances, we do not find it appropriate io equitably toll the 90-day period for seeking reopening even if we had the authority to do so. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rodel E. Rodis, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Termination; Waiver of Deportability
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s January 12, 2007, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States to his native Philippines as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2000).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by ordering him removed on the basis of his 1997 conviction for methamphetamine possession despite evidence that the conviction was the subject of a collateral challenge in California Superior Court. This argument lacks merit, however, because the pendency of a collateral challenge to a criminal conviction has no effect for immigration purposes unless and until the conviction is in fact overturned or materially modified. Grageda v. U.S. I.N.S., 12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 1993) (quoting Morales-Alvarado v. INS, 655 F.2d 172, 175 (9th Cir. 1981)); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). We have received no indication that the respondent’s conviction has been vacated or materially modified, and therefore it constitutes a valid factual predicate for the charge of deportability.
 
The respondent also contends that he was deprived of his due process right to a full and fair hearing because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney, who failed to file an application for a waiver of deportability under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), by a court-imposed deadline.1 Assuming arguendo that counsel’s failure to file the relevant application was defective performance, we nonetheless find no due process violation because counsel’s omission did not materially prejudice the respondent. Specifically, had the application in question been timely filed, it would have been subject to mandatory denial because the ground of deportability sought to be waived was based on a criminal conviction that resulted from a plea agreement entered into after April 1, 1997, the date when former section 212(c) of the Act was repealed. Sections 304(b) and 309(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009.2 Accordingly, we reject the contention that prior counsel’s ostensibly defective performance violated the respondent’s due process right to a full and fair hearing.
 
*2 In conclusion, the respondent is deportable as charged and has not met his burden of demonstrating that he is eligible for any form of relief from removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). Furthermore, the respondent has not proven that his due process rights were violated during the course of his removal proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also suggests that his former attorney was ineffective by failing to provide the Immigration Judge with evidence reflecting the pendency of his collateral challenge to the conviction underlying the charge of deportability. As we have already noted, however, the pendency of that challenge had no effect on the validity of the removal proceedings.

2

Specifically, the conviction record reflects that the respondent was not arrested for his methamphetamine possession offense until April 6, 1997 (Group Exh. 5, unnumbered page 4), approximately 1 week after former section 212(c) was repealed, and his plea agreement was obviously not entered into until some time thereafter. Consequently, IIRIRA § 304(b) has no impermissible retroactive effect vis-a-vis the respondent.

FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Virna A. Wright,
Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: HURWITZ, Acting Vice Chairman; HOLMES and MILLER, Board Members.
HURWITZ, Acting Vice Chairman:
In a decision dated January 22, 2004, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable on his own admissions and denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal under section 241(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b) (2000), and protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46, 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988) (“Convention Against Torture”). On December 4, 2004, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, and the respondent subsequently filed a petition for review. On July 11, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded this case with a request that we further consider the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s asylum application was frivolous, and that we formulate standards for deciding when an asylum application may be found to be *152 frivolous. Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 455 F.3d 106 (2d Cir. 2006). Upon further consideration, the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s finding that his asylum application was frivolous will be sustained, and that part of our decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s ruling in that regard will be vacated.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China who entered the United States in January 2002 without proper documents. The respondent was placed in removal proceedings and filed his original Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589) in Immigration Court in August 2002. The claim was based principally on problems related to his wife’s practice of Falun Gong. A statement included with the original asylum application indicated that he and his wife had two children, a son born on September 24, 1989, and a daughter born on May 2, 1991. In regard to the second child, the statement provided:
**2 According to the family planning policy, we were not allowed to have a second child. However, my wife and I believe[d] that there would not be any social security and retirement system to assure peasants like us. Therefore we had a second child. We hid here and there to avoid being captured by government officials. In order to give birth to my daughter, Liu Yin Fang, we hid here and there and led a stressful life.
 
In support of his original application for asylum, the respondent provided copies of his children’s birth certificates, each of which identified the respondent as the father and the respondent’s wife as the mother. He also submitted a copy of a Household Registration Booklet listing himself, his wife, and his son and daughter as members of the household.
 
Nearly a year after filing the original asylum application, the respondent retained new counsel and filed an amended application with a supporting statement providing the following account of events. After their son’s birth on September 24, 1989, his wife became pregnant again in August 1990. She avoided the quarterly check-ups with family planning officials because the second pregnancy violated the family planning laws. On April 20, 1991, four family planning officials came to their home and forcibly took his wife for an abortion. On May 8, 1991, the respondent’s sister-in-law found an abandoned female infant alongside a road in the village. The respondent and his wife informally adopted the infant as their own. In December 1996, the family planning office learned of the second child and fined the respondent and his wife for an illegal adoption. The pressures of these events affected his wife’s health and caused her to turn to the practice of Falun Gong for relief.
 
The remainder of the statement tracks the Falun Gong aspects of the claim contained in the original application and supporting statement. In support of *153 his amended asylum application, the respondent submitted an abortion certificate, a fine receipt, and statements from his wife and the sister-in-law who found the infant.
 
At a hearing before the Immigration Judge, the respondent testified concerning his request for asylum and answered questions from his attorney, the Government attorney, and the Immigration Judge. In regard to his wife’s second pregnancy, he testified that his wife remained at home undetected for almost the entire term of her pregnancy until the four family planning officials came to their home and forcibly took her for an abortion.
 
After the hearing, the Immigration Judge issued an oral decision denying the respondent’s requests for relief from removal and ordering him removed to the People’s Republic of China. In her decision, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not presented a credible claim for asylum or withholding of removal. She also found that the respondent had submitted a frivolous application for asylum in that he had deliberately fabricated the account of the abortion and the illegal adoption in his amended asylum application in order to obtain immigration benefits in the United States.
 
**3 The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision. In regard to the frivolousness finding, the respondent stated in his notice of appeal that he did not mention his wife’s abortion in the original application for asylum because “he did not meet the attorney and he was not interviewed by the attorney before filing the original I-589” and “[t]he secretary missed mention [ing] his wife’s abortion in his original I-589.” Other than the conclusory statement that the determination was “arbitrary and capricious,” and that there was no confirmation from the consulate that documents submitted by the respondent were fraudulent, the respondent’s 8-page brief did not address the Immigration Judge’s frivolousness finding. We affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion.
 
The respondent then petitioned the Second Circuit for review, challenging both the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility determination and her frivolousness finding. The Second Circuit concluded that “substantial evidence support[ed] the credibility ruling against [the respondent]” but remanded the frivolousness finding to give the Board “an opportunity, in the first instance, to formulate standards for deciding when an asylum seeker’s application may be deemed frivolous.” Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 108.
  
II. STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 
In 1996, Congress amended the immigration law to discourage the filing of frivolous asylum applications. Section 208(d)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(4)(A) (2000), requires the Attorney General to advise an alien applying for asylum, at the time of filing an application, of the consequences *154 of knowingly filing a frivolous application. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(c)(1)(iii) (2006). Those consequences are stated in section 208(d)(6) of the Act, which provides as follows:
If the Attorney General determines that an alien has knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum and the alien has received the notice under paragraph (4)(A), the alien shall be permanently ineligible for any benefits under this Act, effective as of the date of a final determination on such application.
 
 
The regulation that governs the determination whether an asylum application is frivolous provides:
For applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, an applicant is subject to the provisions of section 208(d)(6) of the Act only if a final order by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application. For purposes of this section, an asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated. Such finding shall only be made if the immigration judge or the Board is satisfied that the applicant, during the course of the proceedings, has had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim. For purposes of this section, a finding that an alien filed a frivolous asylum application shall not preclude the alien from seeking withholding of removal.
 
**4 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20 (2006).
 
In preparing this regulation, the Attorney General stated that the Department of Justice was “carrying out one of the central principles of the asylum reform process begun in 1993; to discourage applicants from making patently false claims.” Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Detention and Removal of Aliens; Conduct of Removal Proceedings; Asylum Procedures, 62 Fed. Reg. 444, 447 (Jan. 3, 1997) (Supplementary Information). In the Federal Register Notice promulgating the final “Asylum Procedures” rule in 2000, the Attorney General added the following observations:
One commenter stated that the regulatory definition of “frivolous” does not contain appropriate safeguards, and that the Service should advise every asylum applicant of the consequences of filing frivolous claims. The current regulation provides appropriate safeguards by stipulating that an immigration judge or the Board must be satisfied that an applicant had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies before finding that an applicant filed a frivolous application, and by permitting an applicant to seek withholding of removal even if he or she is found to have filed a frivolous application. The regulation itself also advises an applicant that he or she is subject to the provisions of section 208(d)(6) of the Act if a final order specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application. Finally, both the instructions to the Form I-589 and the application itself warn the applicant about the consequences of filing a frivolous claim, as required by section 208(d)(4) of the Act.

*155 III. APPLYING THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 
The implementing regulation provides a comprehensive framework for determining whether an asylum application is frivolous. Given the serious consequences of a frivolousness finding, the regulation provides a number of procedural safeguards. These include the following requirements: (1) notice to the alien of the consequences of filing a frivolous application; (2) a specific finding by the Immigration Judge or the Board that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application; (3) sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that a material element of the asylum application was deliberately fabricated; and (4) an indication that the alien has been afforded sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.1 We address each of these requirements in turn.
  
A. Notice
 
The statute and regulation require that the Attorney General advise the alien at the time of filing an asylum application of the consequences of filing a frivolous application, i.e., permanent ineligibility for any benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act except for withholding of removal. See section 208(d)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. In this case, the record includes a written notice from the Immigration Judge entitled “Notice of Privilege of Counsel and Consequences of Knowingly Filing a Frivolous Application for Asylum,” which sets forth the requisite warnings of the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application.2 Additionally, the Form I-589 contains a written warning that “[a]pplicants determined to have knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum will be permanently ineligible for any benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act.” At the *156 time of filing the original application, then counsel for the respondent assured the Immigration Judge that he had informed the respondent of the consequences of filing a frivolous application for asylum. As the respondent has not asserted a lack of notice of the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application, we will focus our attention on the other requirements for a frivolousness finding.
  
B. Specific Findings
 
**5 The regulation subjects an alien to the penalty provision for filing a frivolous application “only if a final order by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. The regulation further provides that “an asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.” Id. An element of a claim is “fabricated” when it misrepresents the truth. Black’s Law Dictionary 597 (8th ed. 2004) (stating that “fabricated evidence” is “[f]alse or deceitful evidence”). A “deliberate” fabrication involves a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of the truth. Id. at. 459 (stating that “deliberate” means “[i]ntentional; premeditated; fully considered”). Therefore, an Immigration Judge’s specific finding that a respondent deliberately fabricated a material element of his asylum claim constitutes a finding that he knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application.
 
As a number of courts have observed, “‘a finding of frivolousness does not flow automatically from an adverse credibility determination.”’ Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 113 (quoting Muhanna v. Gonzales, 399 F.3d 582, 589 (3d Cir. 2005)); see also Scheerer v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 445 F.3d 1311, 1317 (11th Cir. 2006) (“[A]n adverse credibility determination alone cannot support a finding of frivolousness.”). We agree that the Immigration Judge must separately address the question of frivolousness, including a discussion of the evidence supporting a finding that the respondent deliberately fabricated a material element of the asylum claim.
 
The Immigration Judge in this case, after finding the respondent not credible, separately addressed the question of frivolousness and provided the following analysis:
[T]he respondent’s application for political asylum has been deliberately fabricated in order to obtain immigration benefits in the United States. The original I-589 application for political asylum indicates that the respondent has a daughter. The statement attached to that application indicates that his wife gave birth to that daughter and was hiding in order to be able to effectively give birth to that daughter. The respondent’s new application is totally and completely different. It states that the daughter was adopted when the respondent’s sister-in-law found the baby girl in a rice paddy.
 
The respondent’s Q&A airport statements and credible fear interviews also mention absolutely nothing about any family planning problems in the People’s Republic of China, not any alleged forced abortion. The documentary evidence is totally and *157 completely lacking in order to overcome these most glaring discrepancies. It appears that the respondent and his wife do have a daughter and that she was naturally born to the respondent. This is substantiated by the household registration booklet and notarial birth certificate, and that the respondent has fabricated this story about an adopted daughter, in order to obtain immigration benefits in the United States. I, therefore, find that the respondent’s application for asylum must also be deemed frivolous.
 
**6 In these two paragraphs the Immigration Judge finds that the respondent “deliberately fabricated” the account of the abortion and illegal adoption in the second asylum application. As to materiality, she refers to “totally and completely different” aspects of the amended application-principally the account of the abortion and adoption. These findings meet the regulatory requirement that the Immigration Judge separately address and include specific findings that the respondent deliberately fabricated material elements of his asylum claim.
  
C. Burden of proof
 
We now turn to whether the Immigration Judge’s findings are supported by the evidence of record. In its remand, the court has requested that we provide guidance regarding “who carries the burden of proof, what degree of certainty is required, when an opportunity to be heard will be deemed sufficient, how ‘deliberate’ and ‘material’ a fabrication must be, and what deference the BIA owes to an IJ’s finding in this context.” Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 113.
 
Ordinarily, an applicant for relief from removal has the burden of demonstrating that he or she meets all of the requirements for eligibility for the applicable form of relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d) (2006) (providing that the alien shall have “the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion”). Moreover, “[i]f the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.” Id.
 
A frivolousness finding, unlike a determination in regard to eligibility for a particular form of relief governed by 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d), is a preemptive determination which, once made, forever bars an alien from any benefit under the Act. Because of the severe consequences that flow from a frivolousness finding, the preponderance of the evidence must support an Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent knowingly and deliberately fabricated material elements of the claim. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. Under the regulation, plausible explanations offered by the respondent must be considered in the ultimate determination whether the preponderance of the evidence supports a frivolousness finding.
 
*158 In regard to the requisite degree of proof, the court in Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 114, suggests that an emerging principle may be that in light of the serious consequences stemming from a frivolousness finding, “concrete and conclusive evidence of fabrication” should be required to support a finding of frivolousness. The court makes this suggestion after reviewing four published decisions upholding frivolousness findings and concluding that each involved “tangible evidence of fabrication that could not reasonably be disputed.” Id. at 115 (citing Ignatova v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1209, 1214 (8th Cir. 2005) (medical records submitted by the alien were identified by the hospital as fraudulent); Selami v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 621, 626-27 (6th Cir. 2005) (copied documents provided by the alien were clear forgeries when compared to true copies of the originals); Efe v. Ashcroft, 293 F.3d 899, 908 (5th Cir. 2002) (alien’s claim regarding age was conclusively disproved by dental records); Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 275 F.3d 1334, 1339 (11th Cir. 2001) (alien admitting he lied in his previously filed asylum application).
 
**7 We find no indication in the statute or regulation that a frivolousness finding must be supported by “concrete or conclusive” evidence of fabrication. As a general rule, “the law draws no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence in requiring the government to carry its burden of proof.” United States v. MacPherson, 424 F.3d 183, 190 (2d Cir. 2005). Moreover, proof that conduct was knowing or deliberate may be demonstrated by circumstantial evidence. Mayer v. Oil Field Systems Corp., 803 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1986). After taking into account the respondent’s explanations for discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim, however, the Immigration Judge must provide cogent and convincing reasons for finding by a preponderance of the evidence that an asylum applicant knowingly and deliberately fabricated material elements of the claim.
 
As the Attorney General emphasized at the time the regulation was promulgated, the regulatory standards for the frivolousness finding have been formulated with the severity of the consequences in mind. See Asylum Procedures, 65 Fed. Reg. at 76,128 (“The Department believes that the current regulation provides for appropriate safeguards for filing a frivolous asylum application, and that, for the reasons set forth in the supplemental information to the January 3, 1997, proposed rule, the definition of frivolous is sufficient.”) (Supplementary Information). As discussed below, in addition to mandating notice of consequences and specific findings of deliberate fabrication of a material element of the asylum application, as well as placing the ultimate burden of proof on the Government, the regulation requires that particular attention be given to providing the alien a sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim relied on in the frivolousness finding.
 
In considering an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision filed after September 25, 2002, as was the appeal in this case, we give de novo review *159 to questions of law, discretion, and judgment, but review findings of fact only for clear error. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(ii) (2006). We may not engage in fact-finding of our own other than to take administrative notice of commonly known facts. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Determining whether a fabrication was knowing or deliberate is a factual question of intent that is reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Awadallah, 349 F.3d 42, 65 (2d Cir. 2003). Whether a fabrication was material involves mixed questions of fact and law. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 521 (1995). Whether the Immigration Judge properly applied the regulatory framework is a question of law.
 
**8 In her decision, the Immigration Judge identified concerns regarding discrepancies and plausibility that indicated to her that the respondent may have deliberately fabricated material elements of his amended asylum application. See Monter v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 546, 553-54 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating that a misrepresentation is material if it has “‘a natural tendency to influence or was capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed”’ (quoting Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 770 (1988))). These concerns were not mere incidental or tangential discrepancies or omissions. As the court acknowledged in its assessment of the Immigration Judge’s credibility determination, the respondent’s claim in his original application “that his wife gave birth to their second child, rather than simply reporting (without emphasis or elaboration) that they had adopted their daughter in May 1991” is a “glaring inconsistency” when compared to the new claims in the amended application based on an illegal adoption of that same child after a forced abortion. Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 111.
 
As the respondent’s explanations must be considered in determining whether a preponderance of the evidence ultimately supports the frivolousness finding, we turn to the question whether the respondent was afforded a sufficient opportunity to account for the discrepancies and implausible aspects of his claim relied on by the Immigration Judge.
  
D. Sufficient Opportunity To Explain
 
The regulation requires that the frivolousness finding “shall only be made if the immigration judge or the Board is satisfied that the applicant, during the course of the proceedings, has had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. The regulation requires that the alien be given “ample opportunity during his hearing to address and account for any deliberate, material fabrications upon which the IJ may base a finding of frivolousness.” Mingkid v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 468 F.3d 763, 769 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Scheerer v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1317).
 
In order to afford a sufficient opportunity to account for discrepancies, it would be a good practice for an Immigration Judge who believes that an  *160 applicant may have submitted a frivolous asylum application to bring this concern to the attention of the applicant prior to the conclusion of proceedings. See, e.g., Farah v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that where the Immigration Judge relied on different inconsistencies in making the adverse credibility determination from those used in making the frivolousness determination, the respondent lacked a sufficient opportunity to explain the discrepancies related to the frivolousness finding). In some cases, the Government may raise the issue of frivolousness during the course of the hearing. See, e.g., Ignatova v. Gonzales, supra, at 1214 (noting that the Government filed a motion requesting that the Immigration Judge address whether the application was frivolous). In other situations, the Immigration Judge may raise the issue and afford the respondent an opportunity to respond with an explanation or corroborating evidence. See, e.g., Selami v. Gonzales, supra (observing that the Immigration Judge adjourned the hearing to afford the respondent an opportunity to respond to concerns that documents submitted in support of his asylum application appeared to be forged).
 
**9 In the case before us, the Immigration Judge did not mention during the course of the hearing that she was contemplating a frivolousness finding. We do not find that the particular concerns underlying the frivolousness finding were such that the respondent should necessarily have anticipated such a finding and provided explanations relevant to the question whether he deliberately fabricated the account of the forced abortion and illegal adoption in the second application. See Ye v. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 446 F.3d 289 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that for purposes of an adverse credibility determination the respondent need not be afforded an opportunity to respond to self-evident inconsistencies).3
 
The respondent did, however, explain during the course of the hearing why the new claims in his amended asylum application were not included in his original application. In a cover statement accompanying his amended application, he explained that when he filed the original asylum application he did not know that family planning was a basis for asylum, that he had never spoken to his first attorney, that the original asylum application was never read *161 back to him, and that he did not have a chance to correct mistakes in the original application prior to the time it was filed in Immigration Court.4
 
Although the respondent’s explanations raise as many questions as they answer, they do have some bearing on whether he deliberately fabricated critical aspects of the amended application and, therefore, should have been addressed and evaluated by the Immigration Judge. See Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, 439 F.3d 111, 123 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to consider the explanations that an applicant gave in order to rectify discrepancies in testimony).
 
The respondent essentially blames his first attorney and that attorney’s secretary for including incorrect information in his first application, for missing essential elements of his persecution claim that necessitated the filing of an amended application, and for failing to obtain his verification of the contents of his statement accompanying the original application. The regulation provides that “[t]he applicant’s signature [on an asylum application] establishes a presumption that the applicant is aware of the contents of the application.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.3(c)(2) (2006). The respondent’s first attorney signed the declaration under Part E of the original asylum application verifying that the information in the application “was provided to me by the applicant and that the completed application was read to the applicant in his or her native language or a language he or she understands for verification before he or she signed the application in my presence.”
 
Under the circumstances in this case, the Immigration Judge had good reason to be concerned with the plausibility of the abortion and illegal adoption aspects of the respondent’s amended asylum application. She should not, however, have entered a frivolousness finding without communicating these concerns to the respondent before concluding the proceedings and without addressing the respondent’s explanations. Had she confronted the respondent with her concerns, she could have further probed for clarification of the manner in which the original asylum application was prepared. See Matter of S-M-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1997) (describing the shared responsibility of parties and the Immigration Judge to assure that relevant *162 evidence is included the record). Further inquiry could have included a request for corroborating evidence from former counsel regarding the manner in which the first asylum application was prepared.5
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
**10 At the time of filing his amended asylum application, the respondent provided explanations relevant to the question whether he had deliberately fabricated a material element of the claims in his amended asylum application. These explanations should have been more fully explored during the course of the hearing and addressed in the Immigration Judge’s decision. For these reasons, we find that the “frivolousness” determination in this case does not meet the regulatory requirement that the respondent be afforded a sufficient opportunity to explain perceived discrepancies or implausibilities. We will therefore vacate our prior decision to the extent that it affirms the Immigration Judges’ frivolousness finding and sustain the respondent’s appeal from that finding.
 
ORDER: Our prior decision is vacated to the extent that it affirms the Immigration Judge’s frivolousness finding, and the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s frivolousness finding is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States to the People’s Republic of China pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s decision of January 22, 2004.

In light of the regulatory requirement that there be evidence of a deliberate fabrication of a material element of a claim, the term “fraudulent” may be more appropriate than the term “frivolous” when applied to a questionable asylum application. See Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 275 F.3d 1334, 1339, n.11 (11th Cir. 2001) (observing that the term “frivolous” generally means “insignificant, trivial, silly or gay” (quoting Webster, New International Dictionary (3d ed. 1961))). Obvious legal insufficiency of a claim does not support a frivolousness finding. Scheerer v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 445 F.3d 1311, 1318 (11th Cir. 2006).

2

The notice, which was entered into the record as an exhibit on March 5, 2002, states in relevant part: “Before you file an asylum application (Form I-589) the law (section 208(d)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act) requires that you be advised specifically about the consequences of knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum in the United States. If you knowingly file a frivolous application for asylum, YOU WILL BE BARRED FOREVER from receiving any benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act. A frivolous application for asylum is one which contains statements or responses to questions that are deliberately fabricated. Not being granted asylum does not mean that your application is frivolous.”

3

The requirement that the respondent be afforded a sufficient opportunity to explain is not to be applied in a mechanical fashion. There may be situations in which the deliberate fabrication of a material aspect of the asylum claim is so clear on the record that a formal request for an explanation would be a needless exercise. See, e.g., Barreto-Claro v. Att’y Gen., supra (finding that the respondent’s admissions that he stated falsely on his first asylum application that he had never before applied for refugee or asylum status and that he gave a fraudulent account of how he came to the United States established that he deliberately fabricated facts that were materially relevant to the question whether he had been firmly resettled in another country prior to arrival in the United States).

4

The respondent’s concession that his first statement included erroneous information is not enough in and of itself to indicate that he knowingly filed an application containing a deliberate fabrication of a material element of his claim. He contends that he was unaware of the incorrect information included in that application and unaware that his wife’s forced abortion or their fines for illegally adopting a child could be relevant to a claim for asylum. As we are limited to reviewing the Immigration Judge’s findings for clear error and do not engage in factual determinations, our focus on appeal is limited to whether the evidence supports a finding in regard to the factors in the amended asylum application identified by the Immigration Judge as deliberately fabricated or implausible material elements of the claim.

5

When an applicant for asylum claims ineffective assistance of counsel as an exception to the 1-year deadline for filing an asylum application, for example, he must file an affidavit describing the agreement entered into with counsel, inform counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned of the allegations being leveled and provide an opportunity to respond, and indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal obligations. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5)(iii) (2006); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the same requirements for motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel).

File: AXX XX9 518 - Houston

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The last order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on October 31, 2006. The respondent’s current motion, initially filed on February 2, 2007, is untimely and will be denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent argues that his former counsel, Richard Prinz, provided ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings before the Immigration Judge, and that Ajay Choudhary, his subsequent counsel, provided ineffective assistance of counsel by refusing to pursue ineffective assistance charges against Mr. Prinz, and by instead pursuing a sua sponte reopening before the Immigration Judge. The respondent asserts that he has notified both attorneys of his actions and that he has filed a complaint against both attorneys with the Texas Bar Association.
 
According to the record, Mr. Prinz was the respondent’s attorney of record from January 31, 2001, until Mr. Choudhary’s firm filed a superceding notice of representation (EOIR-28) in June 2006, Mr. Prinz represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge, who rendered his decision on February 15, 2001, denying the motion for a sua sponte reopening before the Immigration Court. Although the respondent blames Mr. Choudhary for failure to pursue the matter, he has not offered a persuasive explanation to excuse the fact that he waited approximately 6 years to complain about Mr. Prinz’s representation. Equitable tolling of a regulatory deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. Rashidi v. American President Lines, 96 F.3d 124, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1996). The respondent has presented no persuasive reason to toll the motions deadline for years. The motion to reopen, as it pertains to Mr. Prinz’s representation, is therefore denied.
 
As regards the accusations against Mr. Choudhary, the motion is also untimely. There is no indication that Mr. Choudhary’s representation was of such a nature as to offend the respondent’s right to due process. Even were we to accept the pending motion as timely, it would be denied, as the respondent failed to show prejudice resulting from claimed ineffective assistance of either counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62; (BIA 2003), Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 884 (5th Cir. 2004).
 
Because the motion is untimely, we could only reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We take this action only in “exceptional situations.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Wang v. Ashcroft, 260 F.3d 448, 453 n.4 (5th Cir. 2001). We decline to take such action here. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathy Giraitis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, appeals the Immigration Judge’s January 19, 2007 decision finding him removable and denying his application for cancellation of removal for certain lawful permanent residents under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)has filed a motion for summary affirmance. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Under this standard, the Board may not reverse an Immigration Judge’s factfinding unless we determine that the Immigration Judge committed clear error. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (stating that the Board must defer to the factual determinations of an Immigration Judge in the absence of clear error). In this case, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s factual findings. In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s negative equities, including his criminal history, his lack of rehabilitation, and his misrepresentations made under oath to the Immigration Judge about his criminal history, compared to the police records, outweigh his family ties and other positive equities. See I.J. at 11-17; Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978). On appeal, the respondent indicates that the Immigration Judge gave insufficient weight to his positive equities and evidence of his rehabilitation. We disagree. The Immigration Judge considered these factors, but concluded that the respondent’s criminal activities indicated a lack of rehabilitation and outweighed his positive equities. The Immigration Judge also stated that the respondent’s misrepresentations to the court are a reason for discretionary denial of his application for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge’s conclusions were reasonable and we find no reason to overturn them.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he was not properly represented by counsel and that there was a lack of due process. Specifically, he claims that the Immigration Judge did not allow two of his witnesses, one of his sister’s and one of his cousins, to testify at his hearing. To the extent that the respondent has attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 With regard to the claim of lack of due process, we note that there were numerous hearings and extensive testimony (see page transcript of the various hearings). The Immigration Judge allowed testimony from the respondent’s father’s cousin, whom the respondent referred to as his “uncle.” A review of the transcripts of the hearings does not indicate that the respondent’s sister or cousin were ever presented as witnesses. At the hearing on September 8, 2006, the respondent brought four friends, but not his sister, who apparently was sick (Tr. at 15-18). The Immigration Judge allowed these people into the courtroom and had each one identify themselves (Tr. at 16-18). However, the respondent never indicated that he wanted these people to testify on his behalf. In the course of that hearing, it was determined that the respondent had several criminal convictions (Tr. at 19-20, 27-32). The Immigration Judge found it necessary to continue the hearing in order for the parties to obtain all the criminal records. No testimony was elicited from any of the respondent’s friends. Further, we note that at the final merits hearing, the Immigration Judge specifically asked the respondent’s attorney if there were any other witnesses (Tr. at 83). Apparently, there were none as the respondent’s attorney made no request to call any additional witnesses to testify. Contrary to the respondent’s allegations, we find that the record of proceedings fails to show that the Immigration Judge refused to allow any of the respondent’s witnesses to testify. Accordingly, there is no evidence of a lack of due process.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Controlled substance violation
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act
 
  
APPLICATION: Continuance, cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 28, 2006, finding the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), based on the respondent’s record of conviction1 (Exh. 6). The Immigration Judge also found the respondent’s 2005 California drug trafficking conviction rendered the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as having been convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined by section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), and ineligible for the requested relief from removal. In addition, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance while awaiting action on a pending Habeas Corpus petition seeking to vacate that conviction.2 The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Mexico. The respondent’s appeal from that decision will be dismissed.
 
The only issue raised on appeal is the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in not granting his request for a continuance while awaiting action on his pending post-conviction motion to set aside and vacate the 2005 California Possession for Sale of a Controlled Substance, to wit: Methamphetamine, which underpins not only the aggravated felony charge of removability, but also precludes his eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, premised on his claim that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by his criminal attorney in that he was not advised of the possible immigration consequences of his guilty plea as to that offense.
 
We find no merit to the contentions raised by the respondent on appeal. At the outset, even if we were to accept the respondent’s assertion that the attorney at his criminal trial did not explain the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction, unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding his guilt or innocence. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). In addition, the Ninth Circuit has held that the Immigration Judge and the Board may not adjudicate the validity of an underlying criminal conviction. See Pablo v. INS, 72 F.3d 110, 113 (9th Cir.1995) (the court observed that “¿tºhe BIA correctly refused, in effect, to retry these criminal cases based on ¿alienº’s claim that he was innocent of the charges although he pleaded guilty to them”’; De la Cruz v. INS, 951 F.2d 226, 228 (9th Cir. 1991) (Upon petitioner’s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his state, court criminal trial because he was not advised of the deportation consequences of pleading guilty, the court recited that the “INS has no power to adjudicate the validity of state convictions underlying deportation hearings”). We observe, moreover, that a conviction is deemed final when all direct appeals have been exhausted or waived. See Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546 (BIA 1988). The pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks, not constituting direct appeals, however, does not serve to negate the finality of the convictions or the charge of deportability, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to that motion. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 1993).
 
*2 In addition, the respondent is precluded from collaterally attacking his criminal record of conviction in a deportation proceeding. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir. 1993) (citing Avila-Murrieta v. INS, 762 F.2d 733, 736 (9th Cir.1985) and Ocon-Perez v. INS, 550 F.2d 1153, 1154 (9th Cir. 1977)). Moreover, the court in Urbina-Mauricio found that “¿aºcriminal conviction is final for the purposes of immigration review if the alien has exhausted or waived direct appellate review.” Urbina-Mauricio, supra at 1089 (citing Hernandez-Almanza v. INS, 547 F.2d 100, 103 (9th Cir.1976)).
 
Moreover, the decision to grant or deny a continuance is in the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. See De La Cruz v. INS, supra; see also Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). That decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, supra at 237; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. There is no indication in the record that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. An Immigration Judge presented with a facially valid charge of removability need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. See Contreras v. Schiltgen, 122 F.3d 30, 33-34 (9th Cir. 1997), aff’d on add’l grounds in Contreras v. Schiltgen, 151 F.3d 906 (9th Cir.1998) (Contreras II) (the court found that the “validity of ¿the alien’sº California conviction can only be tested in an action against the state, which has the greatest interest in preserving its judgment and the best ability to either correct or defend it …and … ¿uºntil ¿the alienº has successfully overturned his conviction in such a proceeding, the ¿Immigration Judgeº is entitled to rely on the conviction as a basis for custody and eventual deportation.”).
 
In addition, we note that approximately 4 1/2 months have elapsed since the Immigration Judge rendered his decision in this matter, and we have yet to receive any indication from the respondent that he has prevailed in his collateral criminal proceedings. Consequently, as observed above, no purpose other than an unnecessary delay of the proceedings would be served by a further continuance, and the Immigration Judge exercised sound discretion in denying the request. See Matter of Sibrun, supra at 356-57. Therefore, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision not to allow the respondent a further continuance to collaterally challenge the conviction. Because the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the respondent’s request for a further continuance, his appellate claim of a due process violation fails. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a procedural due process challenge to deportation proceedings, alien must show error and substantial prejudice).
 
*3 The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the conviction record submitted in this case. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). Furthermore, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The record reflects that on March 4, 2003, the respondent was convicted in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside, California, of the offense of Sell, Transport, Furnish, Administer, Import, and Give Away a Controlled Substance, and Offer to Sell, Transport, Furnish, Administer, Import, and Give Away a Controlled Substance, to wit: Methamphetamine, in violation of section 11379(a) of the California Health and Safety Code (Exh. 6). In addition, the record reflects that on March 1, 2005, the respondent was convicted in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside, California, of the offense of Possession for Sale of a Controlled Substance, to wit: Methamphetamine, in violation of section 11378 of the California Health and Safety Code (Exh. 6).

The Immigration Judge found that as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has determined that section 11379(a) of California’s Health and Safety Code is a divisible statute that encompasses offenses that both do and do not constitute an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish that the respondent’s 2003 California controlled substance conviction under section 11379(a) of California’s Health and Safety Code conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under the Act (I.J. at 5-6). United States v. Navidad-Marcos, 367 F.3d 903 (9th Cir. 2004). However, the Immigration Judge found the respondent’s 2005 California Possession for Sale conviction under section 11378 of California’s Health and Safety Code conviction did not pose a similar problem and constitutes an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act (I.J. at 6).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Morris I. Onyewuchi,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 12, 2007. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, was admitted to the United States as an immigrant on January 30, 1990. He was convicted on November 17, 2004, for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of Georgia Criminal Code section 16-13-30(b), possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of Georgia Criminal Code section 16-13-30(j), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Georgia Criminal Code section 16-11-131. The respondent was sentenced to 12, 10 and 5 years of incarceration, respectively, for these offenses. The respondent had previously been convicted on December 24, 1998, for possession of cocaine, and was granted cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent expressed no fear of returning to Ghana.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for any relief. The respondent’s convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, qualify as aggravated felonies under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), because the offenses involve a trafficking element and are punishable as felonies under the Controlled Substances Act, 8 U.S.C. § 801 et. seq. The distribution of a small amount of marijuana without remuneration is only punishable as a misdemeanor under the CSA, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4), and the respondent claims on appeal that he was found guilty of possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana. However, even if this exception applies, the respondent’s cocaine distribution offense will sustain the aggravated felony charge under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, and the marijuana offense renders the respondent deportable as charged under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation. The respondent was not erroneously charged with being removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony firearms trafficking offense under section 101(a)(43)(C) of the Act, as the respondent contends on appeal, but as an alien subject to deportation for a firearms offense under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act. Insofar as the respondent argues that his criminal convictions are invalid because he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal proceedings, we note that the Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: A71 788 812 - Los Angeles
April 6, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Seth L. Reszko, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On November 30, 2000, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a motion to reopen. The respondent, who is from India, filed a motion to reopen with the Board on July 20, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board normally must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Therefore, to the extent that the respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status, based on “an approved I-140 petition,” the motion is untimely, and is denied.
 
The respondent argues that he is eligible to apply for suspension of deportation under the settlement agreement found at Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, 243 F.Supp. 2d 1029 (N.D. Cal. 2002). That lawsuit challenged actions which prohibited Immigration Judges and the Board from granting suspension of deportation during the period between February 13 and April 1, 1997. On April 1, 1997, section 309(c)(5) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 took effect, and made individuals ineligible for suspension of deportation if they had not been continuously physically present in the United States for a period of seven years at the time that they were served with an Order to Show Cause.
 
Yet a motion to reopen seeking benefits under the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement had to be filed during a “motion to reopen period” which ended on March 20, 2005. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1036; 68 Fed. Reg. 13727-02 (Mar. 20, 2003); 69 Fed. Reg. 63178-01 (Oct. 29, 2004). The respondent claims that he “did not receive notice from the Executive Office for Immigration Review that he was an eligible class member”, and that the period for filing the motion should therefore be tolled (Respondent’s Mot., at pp. 6-7). In fact, notice of the settlement agreement was provided to individuals in the Federal Register (“[t]his notice is published because while the Executive Office for Immigration Review has the names and addresses of class members and counsels of record for the class member aliens, all parties recognize that some class members have failed to inform EOIR of address changes and the notice is necessary to inform those persons”). See 68 Fed. Reg. 13727-02 (Mar. 20, 2003).
 
*2 In any event, we will not reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), as the respondent does not fall within the purview of the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement.
 
The respondent asserts that he is an “eligible class member” under Part II (A) of the settlement agreement. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1031-32. This subsection of the settlement agreement defines as class members
individuals for whom the Immigration Judge either reserved a decision, or scheduled a merits hearing on a suspension application under Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) § 244 (as such section existed in 1996, before amendment by IIRIRA), between February 13, 1997 and April 1, 1997, and the hearing was continued until after April 1, 1997…
 
In this case, the Immigration Judge did not reserve a decision, or continue her decision until after April 1, 1997. Neither was the respondent denied suspension of deportation between October 1, 1996, and March 31, 1997, based on section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1031-32. Rather, on March 19, 1997, the Immigration Judge issued a final decision in which the respondent was granted voluntary departure. The respondent thereafter filed a motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on May 18, 1998. The Immigration Judge explained in that order that at the March 19, 1997, deportation hearing, the respondent waived the right to apply for suspension of deportation. The Immigration Judge further denied the motion to reopen, which claimed that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, as untimely and as failing to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In our November 30, 2000, decision, we agreed with the Immigration Judge that the motion to reopen had been untimely filed, and the respondent failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In the respondent’s case, therefore, a decision on his suspension application was not continued, or withheld until after April 1, 1997. Neither was he denied suspension of deportation between October 1, 1996, and March 31, 1997, based on section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA. The respondent therefore does not fit under the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1031-32. The respondent argues that an Immigration Judge “could have issued a decision denying or granting him suspension of deportation between February 13, 1997 and April 1, 1997, but for Mr. Narang’s prior attorney advising him to withdraw his application based upon the directive that Immigration Judges were required to deny suspension applications under section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA” (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 9). Yet the fact remains that the Immigration Judge in this case did not deny or withhold suspension of deportation between the pertinent dates, based on section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA. The respondent’s speculation about what might have occurred, had his attorney not withdrawn the suspension application, does not place him within the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicholas Marchi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on September 9, 1998, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 6, 1997. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and, as a consequence, ineligible to apply for a waiver under the former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On November 29, 2006, the respondent moved to reopen proceedings, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He alleges that prior counsel failed to timely file his petition for review of our 1998 decision, and later, after the respondent had been removed, illegally re-entered, and was subject to reinstatement of his removal order, failed to advise him of his eligibility for reopening pursuant to Matter of Soriano, 21 I&N Dec. 516 (A.G. 1997). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that the respondent is not eligible for reopening either under Matter of Soriano, supra, or the applicable regulations, and also because the respondent has been previously deported. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
The respondent became a legal permanent resident in 1990. On April 22, 1996, the respondent pleaded guilty to the crime of delivery of methamphetamine, and was later sentenced to 24 months in prison. On May 24, 1996, the respondent was placed in deportation proceedings. On November 6, 1997, the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to deportation from the United States under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, and ineligible due to his status as an aggravated felon for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act. On September 9, 1998, the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent hired an attorney to petition for review of that decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The attorney filed the petition for review on November 23, 1998, and the Ninth Circuit dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction on December 17, 1998, because it was untimely. The respondent was deported to Mexico.
 
On December 20, 2000, the respondent was found in the United States. The respondent was notified of the government’s intent to reinstate the prior deportation order pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, and on January 16, 2001, the respondent was removed pursuant to the reinstated deportation order.
 
*2 On May 16, 2006, the respondent was charged and indicted in the Eastern District of Washington under section 276(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b) (presence in the United States without permission after removal). On November 29, 2006, the respondent moved to reopen deportation proceedings. He contends that when his deportation order was reinstated in 2001, he was eligible to file a special motion to reopen pursuant to Matter of Soriano, supra, and was not informed by his attorney or by the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service that he could reopen on that basis. He also contends that his case should now be reopened pursuant to the federal regulations relating to special motions to reopen for 212(c) relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44 (special motion to seek section 212(c) relief or aliens who pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to certain crimes before April 1, 1997).
 
We will address the respondent’s claims in order. First, because he conceded he was subject to deportation based on the aggravated felony charge after the enactment of Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Tr. at 19, November 5, 1997), he was not eligible to pursue a motion to reopen under the allowance provided in Matter of Soriano, supra. Furthermore, under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, the respondent, who reentered the United States illegally after being deported or removed in 1998, was not eligible for and could not have applied for any relief under the Act at the time his removal order was reinstated.
 
Second, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to acts or omissions of prior counsel in 1998 and 2001 are without merit. The respondent failed to demonstrate even minimal adherence to the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013, 1023 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim inadequate where the alien failed to comply with the threshold procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and the facts underlying his claim were not plain on the face of the record). The respondent failed to show that he was prejudiced to such an extent that his prior counsel’s performance “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
Finally, the respondent is ineligible for a grant of a special 212(c) motion under the applicable regulations. The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(h) provides that a special 212(c) motion must be filed on or before April 26, 2005. Here, the respondent’s motion was not filed until November 29, 2006. The regulatory limitation on motions provided in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) is not at issue in this case. Compare Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007). In addition, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2) prohibits the filing of a special 212(c) motion by an alien who has been issued a final order of deportation or removal, who then illegally returns to the United States. Accordingly, the following order will be entered:

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dona J.F. Justus,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. This matter was last before us on March 25, 2004, when we adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge’s February 13, 2003, decision in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any matter previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or by September 30, 1996, whichever is later. In the instant matter, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before June 23, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until December 22, 2006. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The respondent argues, however, that equitable tolling should be applied to the filing deadline because of the ineffective assistance of her previous counsel. Specifically, she claims that although she inquired several times about the status of her appeal before the Board, her counsel did not inform her of the Board’s March 25, 2004, decision until some time in March 2006. As a result, she contends, she missed filing deadlines of the Court of Appeals and this Board, and was denied adjustment of status because of the outstanding 1988 in absentia deportation order issued against her. She has reasserted her argument that she did not appear at her 1988 deportation hearing because she did not receive notice of it. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
To prevail on a due process claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must satisfy the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The alien must show that “the representation afforded [him or her] was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.” See Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194, 198 (5th Cir. 1975). To prevail on a due process claim, the alien must establish that substantial prejudice resulted from the due process violation. See Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001); Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993). Further, we have held that the mere failure to file an appeal does not necessarily amount to substantial prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (failing to timely file an appeal is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel without showing that alien would likely have prevailed on appeal).
 
*2 Here, the respondent supported her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with an affidavit to the State Bar of California in which she sets out the basis for her complaint against her former attorney; an untranslated document entitled “Contrato;” a November 9, 2006, letter to her former counsel informing her of the complaint being filed against her; and a copy of a notice from the State Bar of California showing that it had received the respondent’s complaint against her former counsel. The respondent’s submissions fall short of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, which requires the alien to lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between her and her former counsel, and to provide a copy of the attorney/client agreement. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g) (requiring certified English translation of documents).
 
Even if we found the respondent satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, she has not provided any previously unavailable evidence establishing prima facie proof that if this matter were reopened, she would prevail on her argument that she failed to appear at her 1988 deportation hearing because she did not receive notice. Reopening is therefore not warranted. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). For that reason, the respondent has also failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from her previous counsel’s actions and her due process claim fails. See Zavala v. Ashcroft, supra; Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, supra; Ogbemudia v. INS, supra.
 
Further, we do not find that equitable tolling should be applied here because the respondent failed to exercise due diligence. See Rashidi v. American President Lines, 96 F.3d 124, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1996) (requiring due diligence to toll the statute of limitations period). Our records show that the respondent filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision with this Board on March 6, 2003. In her affidavit supporting her complaint to the State Bar of California, the respondent reveals that she first contacted her attorney’s office in May 2004, more than a year after the appeal was filed, to get a status report. According to her affidavit, although she had not spoken personally to her previous counsel, she then waited another 10 months to make her second inquiry, which was some time in March 2005. According to her affidavit, she was again unable to talk to her previous counsel. Nonetheless, the respondent waited yet another 12 months to make her third and final inquiry in March 2006. After finally speaking with her counsel, the respondent did not file the instant motion until almost 7 months later. Given the stakes here, the facts as presented by the respondent lead us to the conclusion that she failed to exercise due diligence.
 
*3 Finally, the respondent requests that we take this case sua sponte. “As a general rule, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002); Matter of J-J-,21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent has not persuaded us that this matter falls into the category of matters wherein we should invoke our authority to reopen sua sponte. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anthony Nwosu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Y. Park
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II) º- Reentry without admission after being ordered removed
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
On March 24, 2006, an Immigration Judge issued an order granting a motion by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reinstate the July 24, 2000, order removing the respondent from the United States. The respondent moved to reopen, asserting ineffective assistance because counsel did not respond in opposition to the DHS’s reinstatement motion. On May 23, 2006, the Immigration Judge issued a decision denying the motion to reopen and rejecting the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on his inability to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. The respondent appeals the May 23, 2006, decision. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We briefly recite the procedural history of this case. The respondent was ordered removed on July 24, 2000, after being found inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), as an alien who falsely represented himself to be a United States citizen for any purpose or benefit under the Act, and under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, as an immigrant not in possession of a valid entry document. On December 8, 2005, he was served with a Notice to Appear, charging him under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), with reentering the United States without admission after being removed. The Immigration Judge reinstated the original removal order upon the DHS’s motion, and subsequently denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Although the May 23, 2006, order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen is the subject of this appeal, we necessarily must also examine the March 24, 2006, reinstatement order underpinning the motion to reopen. In that order, the Immigration Judge granted the DHS’s motion which sought reinstatement of the respondent’s prior removal order and which also included the filing of a new Notice to Appear, charging the respondent under the reentry-without-admission provision in section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II). We recently held that an Immigration Judge has no authority to reinstate a prior removal order pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, which provides
If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this Act, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
 
*2 Section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5). See Matter of W-C-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 118, 120 (BIA 2007). Here, the motion for reinstatement was accompanied by a Notice to Appear, and once a Notice to Appear has been served on the Immigration Court and jurisdiction has vested therein, the Notice to Appear may not be cancelled. See id. at 120; see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 239.2(a), 1003.14(a). However, the DHS may move to terminate the proceedings for certain enumerated valid reasons, including the fact that the Notice to Appear was improvidently issued. See Matter of W-C-B-, supra, (citing 8 C.F.R. § 239.2(a)(6)).
 
In the instant case, based on new authority set forth in Matter of W-C-B-, the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to reinstate the respondent’s July 24, 2000, removal order. The DHS was authorized to remove him under that order at any time after determining that he had reentered illegally. Instead, the DHS improvidently issued the new Notice to Appear and initiated proceedings. The Immigration Judge could have terminated the proceedings upon a motion by DHS in accordance with the regulations, but no such motion was filed. As the Immigration Judge had no jurisdiction to reinstate the removal order, her March 24, 2006, order will be vacated. The lack of jurisdiction extends to the motion to reopen which was concomitant to the March 24, 2006, reinstatement order, and consequently the May 23, 2006, decision denying that motion similarly will be vacated. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s March 24, 2006, and May 23, 2006, decisions are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order and the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: EMMETT GRENALD
File: A36 489 029 - Newark
March 19, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 27, 2006, at which time the Board denied the respondent’s appeal. On December 13, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that he is a United States citizen based on the United States citizenship of his father. We observe that the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A motion to reopen will not be granted where the evidence supporting the motion was previously available and could have been presented at the previous hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In the instant case, the respondent presents an affidavit from his father and a copy of this man’s birth certificate. See Motion to Reopen. First, this evidence is not new or previously unavailable evidence. See Tr. at 52 (discussing the respondent’s father). This evidence could have been previously presented to the Immigration Judge and this Board. To the extent that the respondent is arguing that he has an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney for failing to submit this evidence, we observe that the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Furthermore, as discussed below, the evidence submitted does not establish his eligibility for relief, so the respondent has not shown the required prejudice. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 107 (3rd Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent’s argument that he is entitled to United States citizenship based on his United States citizen father is incorrect. The burden of proof in establishing alienage in removal proceedings is on the DHS. United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149 (1923); United States v. Neelly, 207 F.2d 281 (7th Cir. 1953). However, one born abroad is prima facie an alien. Matter of A-M-, 7 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1956). Furthermore, where it is undisputed that an alien sought to be deported was born in a foreign country and came to the United States from that country, the burden of proof to establish United States citizenship is upon the alien. United States v. Neelly, supra. Such an alien is required to affirmatively establish his citizenship claim. Matter of A-M-, supra.
 
*2 In the instant case, it is uncontested that the respondent was born in Panama and was born out of wedlock. See Exh. 1; Motion to Reopen. A child born out of wedlock to a United States citizen father, bears the additional burden of establishing a relationship to the father which is legally recognized under our immigration law. Specifically, the respondent must satisfy the requirements outlined in current section 309(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1409.
 
We observe that the respondent was born on December 23, 1971 (Exh. 2). Children born after November 14, 1971, must comply with the requirements of the current version of section 309 of the Act. See Pub. L. 100-525, § 23(e)(3), 102 Stat. 2619. Current section 309 of the amended Act provides, in pertinent part:
(a) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (g) of section 301, and of paragraph (2) of section 308 shall apply as of the date of birth to a person born out of wedlock if -
(1) a blood relationship between the person and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence.
 
(2) the father had the nationality of the United States at the time of the person’s birth.
 
(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years and
 
(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years -
(A) the person is legitimated under the law of the person’s residence or domicile.
 
(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or
 
(C) the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.
 
 
 
 
We observe that the evidence submitted by the respondent, who is now 35 years-old, does not establish that the respondent meets the requirements under current section 309(a)(4) of the Act. Specifically, the affidavit submitted does not suggest that the respondent’s father had legitimated the respondent, acknowledged his paternity under oath or had his paternity established in court prior to the respondent’s eighteenth birthday. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King, (noting that he is not listed on the respondent’s birth certificate).
 
In setting forth the effective date of the ““new”” section 309(a), the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (
Pub. L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609
(Oct. 24, 1988), amended the INA to provide that “except as provided in paragraph (2)03)
 
the new section 309(a)
 
shall apply to persons who have not attained 18 years of age as of the date of the enactment of this Act” (i.e., by November 14, 1986). That paragraph provides that “(2) [t]he old section 309(a) shall apply (A) to any individual who has attained 18 years of age as of the date of enactment of this Act, and (B) any individual with respect to whom paternity was established by legitimation before such date.” See section 23(e)(1) of the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609 (Oct. 24, 1988).
 
*3 We next turn to the question of whether the respondent has shown that he was legitimated before November 14, 1986 (the INAA effective date) for purposes of “old” section 309(a) of the Act. Under the Act, legitimation can take place either under the laws of the respondent’s place of birth or under the laws of the state of the respondent’s father’s domicile. See section 101(b)(1) of the Act. In addition to the terms of the “(2)(B)” exception requiring legitimation to take place by November 14, 1986, legitimation must take place prior to the child reaching the age of 21. See former section 309(a) of the Act. In this case, the affidavit from the respondent’s father indicates that he was not included on the respondent’s birth certificate and left Panama shortly after the respondent’s birth. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King. There is no evidence to suggest that the respondent’s father acknowledged his paternity in Panama before November 14, 1986. See Matter of Sinclair, 13 I&N Dec. 613 (BIA 1970)(finding the a declaration of paternity in Panama before the Mayor of Colon sufficient to legitimate an out-of-wedlock child). The record indicates the respondent’s father’s resided in New Jersey from 1971-1985. The record is unclear as to which state he resided in from 1985 until November 14, 1986. However, there is no evidence establishing that the respondent’s father legitimated him under the laws of any state during this time period. We note that the burden is on the respondent, who was born in Panama, to establish his citizenship. For reasons discussed above, we find that the respondent has not met his burden. We therefore decline to reopen these proceedings. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 27, 2006, at which time the Board denied the respondent’s appeal. On December 13, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that he is a United States citizen based on the United States citizenship of his father. We observe that the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A motion to reopen will not be granted where the evidence supporting the motion was previously available and could have been presented at the previous hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In the instant case, the respondent presents an affidavit from his father and a copy of this man’s birth certificate. See Motion to Reopen. First, this evidence is not new or previously unavailable evidence. See Tr. at 52 (discussing the respondent’s father). This evidence could have been previously presented to the Immigration Judge and this Board. To the extent that the respondent is arguing that he has an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney for failing to submit this evidence, we observe that the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Furthermore, as discussed below, the evidence submitted does not establish his eligibility for relief, so the respondent has not shown the required prejudice. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 107 (3rd Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent’s argument that he is entitled to United States citizenship based on his United States citizen father is incorrect. The burden of proof in establishing alienage in removal proceedings is on the DHS. United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149 (1923); United States v. Neelly, 207 F.2d 281 (7th Cir. 1953). However, one born abroad is prima facie an alien. Matter of A-M-, 7 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1956). Furthermore, where it is undisputed that an alien sought to be deported was born in a foreign country and came to the United States from that country, the burden of proof to establish United States citizenship is upon the alien. United States v. Neelly, supra. Such an alien is required to affirmatively establish his citizenship claim. Matter of A-M-, supra.
 
*2 In the instant case, it is uncontested that the respondent was born in Panama and was born out of wedlock. See Exh. 1; Motion to Reopen. A child born out of wedlock to a United States citizen father, bears the additional burden of establishing a relationship to the father which is legally recognized under our immigration law. Specifically, the respondent must satisfy the requirements outlined in current section 309(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1409.
 
We observe that the respondent was born on December 23, 1971 (Exh. 2). Children born after November 14, 1971, must comply with the requirements of the current version of section 309 of the Act. See Pub. L. 100-525, § 23(e)(3), 102 Stat. 2619. Current section 309 of the amended Act provides, in pertinent part:
(a) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (g) of section 301, and of paragraph (2) of section 308 shall apply as of the date of birth to a person born out of wedlock if -
(1) a blood relationship between the person and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence.
 
(2) the father had the nationality of the United States at the time of the person’s birth.
 
(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years and
 
(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years -
(A) the person is legitimated under the law of the person’s residence or domicile.
 
(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or
 
(C) the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.
 
 
 
 
We observe that the evidence submitted by the respondent, who is now 35 years-old, does not establish that the respondent meets the requirements under current section 309(a)(4) of the Act. Specifically, the affidavit submitted does not suggest that the respondent’s father had legitimated the respondent, acknowledged his paternity under oath or had his paternity established in court prior to the respondent’s eighteenth birthday. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King, (noting that he is not listed on the respondent’s birth certificate).
 
In setting forth the effective date of the ““new”” section 309(a), the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (
Pub. L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609
(Oct. 24, 1988), amended the INA to provide that “except as provided in paragraph (2)03)
 
the new section 309(a)
 
shall apply to persons who have not attained 18 years of age as of the date of the enactment of this Act” (i.e., by November 14, 1986). That paragraph provides that “(2) ¿tºhe old section 309(a) shall apply (A) to any individual who has attained 18 years of age as of the date of enactment of this Act, and (B) any individual with respect to whom paternity was established by legitimation before such date.” See section 23(e)(1) of the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609 (Oct. 24, 1988).
 
*3 We next turn to the question of whether the respondent has shown that he was legitimated before November 14, 1986 (the INAA effective date) for purposes of “old” section 309(a) of the Act. Under the Act, legitimation can take place either under the laws of the respondent’s place of birth or under the laws of the state of the respondent’s father’s domicile. See section 101(b)(1) of the Act. In addition to the terms of the “(2)(B)” exception requiring legitimation to take place by November 14, 1986, legitimation must take place prior to the child reaching the age of 21. See former section 309(a) of the Act. In this case, the affidavit from the respondent’s father indicates that he was not included on the respondent’s birth certificate and left Panama shortly after the respondent’s birth. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King. There is no evidence to suggest that the respondent’s father acknowledged his paternity in Panama before November 14, 1986. See Matter of Sinclair, 13 I&N Dec. 613 (BIA 1970)(finding the a declaration of paternity in Panama before the Mayor of Colon sufficient to legitimate an out-of-wedlock child). The record indicates the respondent’s father’s resided in New Jersey from 1971-1985. The record is unclear as to which state he resided in from 1985 until November 14, 1986. However, there is no evidence establishing that the respondent’s father legitimated him under the laws of any state during this time period. We note that the burden is on the respondent, who was born in Panama, to establish his citizenship. For reasons discussed above, we find that the respondent has not met his burden. We therefore decline to reopen these proceedings. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elsa I. Martinez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James M. Left
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 17, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s November 30, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s second motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered deported in absentia on June 27, 1997.1 The respondent filed a petition for review of our decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On September 19, 2006, the Ninth Circuit granted an unopposed motion to remand and returned the record to the Board for further proceedings. The unopposed motion sought a remand because the Board had not sufficiently articulated its reasons for dismissing the appeal. The Board’s August 17, 2005, decision will be vacated and the respondent’s appeal reinstated. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent raises a variety of issues, each of which will be addressed in turn. In its appellate brief, the DHS states that the respondent’s Notice of Appeal was not timely filed. It contends that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal as a result of the untimely filing.
 
We first address the issue of jurisdiction. The record reflects that although the Immigration Judge rendered his decision on November 30, 2004, the decision was not mailed to the parties until December 7, 2004. The respondent’s appeal was received at the Board on January 6, 2005. Thus, the respondent’s motion was filed within 30 days of the mailing of the decision and is therefore timely.
 
We next examine the merits of the respondent’s appeal. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that her motion was numerically barred when there are no time and number restrictions on motions to reopen in which an alien claims to have lacked notice of a scheduled hearing and was ordered deported in absentia. We agree. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2). However, the respondent raises in her second motion essentially the same argument that she raised in her first motion - namely that the notice was not properly addressed.2 Moreover, she was aware of the fact that she had been ordered deported in absentia at the time that she filed her first motion to reopen yet waited over 7 years to file a second motion to reopen in which she again alleged a lack of notice. An alien cannot file what is essentially the same motion to reopen over and over. Thus, this issue has been fully litigated.
 
The respondent further contends on appeal that her lack of notice constitutes an exceptional circumstance which serves to equitably toll the numerical restrictions on motions to reopen. She states that she provided her correct address to the then Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer and that due to an INS clerical error, her apartment number was omitted from her address which resulted in her not receiving notice of her scheduled hearing. We disagree. As a motion to reopen premised upon a claim of exceptional circumstances, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 180 days of the respondent’s in absentia order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(B)(4)(ii). We also do not find that this untimeliness is subject to equitable tolling. Although the respondent contends that her former attorney did not advise her of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her first motion to reopen, she had not established that she exercised due diligence in this case. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on September 18, 1997, yet the respondent did not file a second motion to reopen until October 29, 2004, over 7 years later. The respondent does not state when, or how often, she contacted her former attorney or describe the efforts that she undertook to remain apprised of the status of the motion to reopen that her former attorney had filed on her behalf. We find that these facts do not support a finding that the respondent exercised due diligence in this case. As she has not demonstrated the requisite due diligence, the untimeliness of her exceptional circumstances claim is not subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.
 
*2 She also asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in stating that he could not construe the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) lack of response to her motion as agreement to reopen since the regulation provides that a motion is deemed unopposed unless a timely response is made. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(iv). The lack of a response from the non-moving party does not mean that a party’s motion to reopen must be granted regardless of its content or merits. In all cases, a party moving to reopen proceedings has the burden of demonstrating that proceedings should be reopened. The respondent in this case failed to meet that burden for the reasons set forth in this decision. Therefore, if the Immigration Judge erred on this point, such error is harmless.
 
The respondent additionally claims that her former attorney, Donald K. Smith, Esquire, did not inform her of the contents of the affidavit that she signed in her first motion to reopen, included in the motion incorrect facts regarding whether she ever lived on the Valley View Street, and failed to inform her of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her first motion to reopen. From these arguments, the respondent appears to be claiming that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from Mr. Smith. She has not, however, complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and re-affirmed in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that motions to reopen alleging ineffective assistance can be denied by the Board where the alien does not meet the Lozada requirements as such rules are reasonable in ordinary circumstances). The respondent does not explain her failure to comply with the Lozada requirements. As a result of such failure, Mr. Smith is deprived of an opportunity to respond to these allegations and the Board is deprived of Mr. Smith’s responses.
 
Lastly, the respondent states that she is adjustment of status eligible because she has an approved visa petition (Form I-130) which was filed by her lawful permanent resident husband. She advises that her husband is in the process of applying for naturalization. However, the respondent has provided no evidence showing that she is married, her husband is a lawful permanent resident, her husband filed a visa petition on her behalf, or that a visa petition for her has been approved. Statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Thus, the respondent has not established that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The Board’s August 17, 2005, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is reinstated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Following the issuance of the in absentia order, the respondent filed with the Immigration Judge, on August 18, 1997, a motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on September 18, 1997. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Court on October 29, 2004. It is the denial of this second motion which the respondent appealed to the Board and which was the subject of our August 17, 2005, decision.

We note that the respondent stated in her first motion that she did not live at the address provided on the hearing notice whereas she said in her second motion that she did live at that address but that such address omitted her apartment number. We consider these arguments, when viewed in the context of the entire record, as a minor difference of degree since the thrust of her arguments is that the “7777 Valley View Street” address was incorrect since it was incomplete.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tamara French, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on August 24, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s December 15, 2004, decision denying his motion to reopen. Previously on July 20, 2004, the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s sole application for relief in the form of voluntary departure and granted such relief pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), but required that the respondent depart by November 17, 2004. On November 28, 2006, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen in order to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved I-130 immigrant petition filed by his United States citizen wife. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, given that we previously dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s December 15, 2004, decsion1 due to the respondent’s failure to present a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, our August 24, 2005, decision remains the final administrative order. See Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999) (stating that an administrative decision becomes final when the Board reaches a decision on appeal); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Further, as the respondent failed to file his current motion within 90 days of our prior decision, his motion is untimely. Also, as the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen in these proceedings, he is barred by the numerical limitations for a motion to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7) (stating that a party may file only one motion to reopen, and that such a motion must be filed within 90 days following the date of the final administrative decision); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Even considering the respondent’s current motion, which is primarily based upon suffering ineffective assistance by his former attorney, Mr. Terence Hoerman, we do not find that the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.2 The respondent alleges, inter alia, that his previous counsel provided ineffective assistance given that the prior motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge “lack¿edº substance, fail¿edº to comply with all ¿theº requirements of Matter of Lozada, and lack¿edº his application for relief” (Respondent’s Motion at 5-9). The respondent also alleges that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s actions given that Mr. Hoerman “failed to file a timely motion” to the Immigration Court and provided him with inaccurate advice (Respondent’s Motion at 8). We note, however, that while the respondent submitted a complaint to the Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission (MAGC) regarding Mr. Hoerman’s alleged misconduct (Respondent’s Motion at Tab H) — which was ultimately dismissed, as discussed below — there is no evidence that the respondent conveyed such information to Mr. Hoerman himself. Rather, while the respondent states that he “mailed his complaint to the ¿MAGCº who in turn mailed it to Mr. Hoerman” (Respondent’s Motion at 8), he has failed to provide any case law or other legal authority stating that a State Bar’s correspondence to the impugned attorney is a sufficient substitute for directly informing the attorney of the alleged misconduct. See Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556 (“the alien must inform counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and give him or her the opportunity to respond”); see also Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Scorteanu needed only to notify former attorney Muresan of the charge of ineffective assistance of counsel.”). Thus, as the respondent has not explained why he chose to rely on the MAGC to inform Mr. Hoerman of the complaint, rather than contacting Mr. Hoerman directly, he has not met the criteria of demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Notwithstanding the respondent’s failure to satisfy the aforementioned procedural requirements, we find that he has not demonstrated prejudice by his former counsel’s representation. See Allabani v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 668, 677-78 (6th Cir. 2005). The record shows that the MAGC — after investigating the respondent’s charges against Mr. Hoerman — issued a decision on August 24, 2006, concluding that Mr. Hoerman’s actions, as alleged by the respondent, did not constitute professional misconduct (Respondent’s Motion at Tab J). Moreover, the respondent fails to show any error in the MAGC’s decision, nor does he reconcile its conclusion with his continued allegations of ineffective assistance regarding Mr. Hoerman’s representation (Respondent’s Motion at 5). See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638; see also Denko v. INS, supra, at 723-24 (“A party must prove prejudice by alleging facts that permit the court to infer that competent counsel would have acted otherwise.”) (quoting Taniguchi v. Schultz, 303 F.3d 950, 958 (9th Cir. 2002)).3 Further, the fact that the respondent is now dissatisfied with Mr. Hoerman’s strategy in pursuing relief suggests that he is disappointed in his tactical decisions rather than the substance of his representation. As we have previously held, complaints based on specific techniques in pursuing relief are not grounds for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). Thus, based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion does not clearly demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s representation.
 
In addition, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that he merits equitable tolling of the time and number limitations for his current motion to reopen (Respondent’s Motion at 9-11). Specifically, given that the respondent has not presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as discussed above, any argument requesting that the time or numeric limitations for reopening be equitably tolled is unavailing. See generally Harchenko v. INS, 379 F.3d 405, 409-10 (6th Cir. 2004). The respondent also alleges that he was prevented from filing the instant motion until an error committed by the Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) — in processing the respondent’s wife’s I-130 petition — was corrected, thereby resulting in his failure to meet the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen (Respondent’s Motion at 9-11; Tab D). However, we need not address the significance of the DHS’s error as allegedly causing a delay in the respondent’s filing of the current motion given that he does not meaningfully address his violation of the numerical limitations described above, or demonstrate that reopening would be warranted except for the DHS’s processing error (Respondent’s Br. at 9-11). See Scorteanu v. INS, supra, at 413 (“this court need not decide” whether equitable tolling should apply given the petitioner’s failure “to prove entitlement to equitable relief”). To the extent that the respondent argues that he was denied due process as a result of the aforementioned errors by the DHS and his former attorneys (Respondent’ s Motion at 11-12), we first note that the Board has no jurisdiction over the applications and matters considered by the DHS. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated how he was denied fundamental fairness in these removal proceedings. See id. (“The alien must prove that ineffective assistance of counsel resulted in prejudice or denial of fundamental fairness in order to prove a denial of due process.”): Rather, the record shows that he had ample opportunities to demonstrate ineffective assistance regarding his previous attorneys, but that all such complaints were found to be meritless. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640 (“The respondent received a full and fair hearing at which he was given every opportunity to present his case.”).
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent seeks a stay of removal (Respondent’s Motion at 10), we note that he has not shown why the execution of his removal order should be stayed and accordingly deny his motion in this regard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f). Finally, we find that the circumstances presented in the respondent’s motion are not “exceptional” as to justify a sua sponte reopening of the matter. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed on November 12, 2004, on three grounds based on the respondent’s (1) untimely filing of the motion, (2) failure to comply with the motion to reopen requirements, including his failure to provide any application for relief or supporting evidence, (3) failure to comply with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See I.J.’s December 15, 2004, decision.

2

We have held that a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40. In addition to complying with the procedural requirements, a respondent must also show that “he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance.” See id. at 638; Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717 (6th Cir. 2003).

3

Additionally, we note that the MAGC twice dismissed the respondent’s complaints regarding the alleged ineffective assistance of a prior attorney, Mr. James Hoare (Respondent’s Motion at Tabs L, M), whose supposed misconduct, the respondent now argues, was not adequately presented by Mr. Hoerman. Specifically, in a decision dated September 29, 2004, the MAGC found the respondent’s allegations against Mr. Hoare to be insufficient to warrant further proceedings — a conclusion that was reaffirmed in its May 24, 2006, decision—while stating that a “failure to achieve a ¿successfulº result” is not “by itself, evidence of misconduct” (Respondent’s Motion at Tabs L, M).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura L. Lichter, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion seeking to have the Board reopen his proceedings sua sponte. The motion, not opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
These proceedings were last before us on July 14, 2005, at which time we denied the respondent’s timely motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 While we found, therein, that the respondent had met the procedural requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we ultimately found that we had no jurisdiction to allow the respondent to seek recourse before the DHS for any alleged ineffective assistance he provided in seeking the respondent’s visa petition. Prior to this July 14, 2005, decision, we also found, on January 26, 2005, that the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s July 25, 2003, decision was without merit; specifically, we found that the respondent’s request for a continuance to adjudicate his third visa petition was without good cause due to the fact that the evidence indicated that the underlying marriage was not bona fide.
 
As the respondent explains in his current motion, the basis of his prior ineffective assistance of counsel motion, the basis of the Immigration Judge’s 2003 denial of his adjustment claim and our dismissal of his appeal therefrom, and the ongoing denial of his continuance requests, all involve a finding that the respondent’s first visa petition involved fraud (Tr. at 18-19). As the respondent explained at his 2003 hearing, and in numerous subsequent briefs, a fraudulent birth certificate was filed with this petition without his knowledge. Subsequently, the respondent explained that his prior counsel failed to address this fraud in his request to approve a second petition.2 Notwithstanding his inability to properly explain the circumstances surrounding this first fraudulent visa petition, the adjudication of his adjustment of status application was continually pretermitted due to the correct assumption that he would be barred from an approved visa petition due to section 204(c) of the Act.
 
In his current motion, the respondent has submitted evidence that his third visa petition has been approved, notwithstanding the bar set forth at section 204(c) of the Act. While no evidence exists in the record save the respondent’s approval notice, and we are aware that the respondent still must demonstrate eligibility for relief as a matter of discretion, the respondent has now demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. We previously found that the respondent had met the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and his claim therein involved the events surrounding his first visa petition, we believe it appropriate to provide the respondent the opportunity to present his case before the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 Accordingly, we will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). On remand to the Immigration Judge the respondent will have an opportunity to present his application for adjustment of status, including his worthiness for such relief as a matter of discretion. The DHS shall have the opportunity to examine and verify the validity of the respondent’s submissions and present evidence.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

Subsequent to this motion, we also dismissed, on June 1, 2006, an appeal from the respondent’s second visa petition, for lack of jurisdiction.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anton F. Mikel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Timothy Maguire
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge decision denying a motion to reconsider the denial of a motion to reopen. As we agree with the Immigration Judge, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on November 22, 2000. He then flied a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on April 7, 2006. A motion to rescind an order entered in absentia, must be filed within 180 days of the entry of the order and demonstrate extraordinary circumstances for the respondent’s failure to appear, or the respondent must show he or she did not receive proper notice of the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that any of the exceptions apply to this case. We first note that, despite his claim that he lacked proper notice due to inadequate translation, he was represented by counsel previously and proper notice of the hearing was provided to both his attorney of record and to the address the respondent provided to the court (Exh. 3). Contrary to further arguments on appeal, this situation does involve the respondent alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, although this is a questionable claim, as the court also informed the respondent directly of the hearing date at the address provided. Further, the respondent was certainly aware he was in proceedings and took no steps to determine the status of his case for over 5 years. In this regard, while he argues that he has exercised due diligence in acting shortly after his claim for asylum became available to him, he did not act with due diligence in determining the status of his immigration case.
 
We next turn to the respondent’s argument, citing Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), that these regulations relate to the recission of the previous order, rather than the reopening he seeks. In Matter of M-S-, supra, the Board held that where an alien who did not receive oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing pursuant to section 242B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(a), moves to reopen deportation proceedings held in absentia under section 242B(c) of the Act in order to apply for a form of relief that was unavailable at the time of the hearing, the rescission requirements prescribed by section 242B(c)(3) of the Act are not applicable. Instead, the motion to reopen is subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F R. § 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3). We note that the respondent is in removal rather than deportation proceedings. Nonetheless, even considering the respondent’s motion as one to reopen rather than to rescind, he was required to have filed it in a timely fashion, within 90 days of the final order.
 
*2 We also find the respondent’s arguments that his motion should be allowed based on changed country conditions, to be unpersuasive. We take note of the horrors his current spouse endured and of her subsequent grant of asylum. Nonetheless, the fact that the respondent recently married her in the United States, is not a change of country conditions in their native Syria, but rather a personal change here in the United States. This is the case, despite the problems the respondent alleges his family has had as a result of his marriage. Federal regulations lift the time and number requirements for motions to reopen:
based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and could not have been discovered and presented at the previous hearing ….
 
8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not adequately established “changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality” to qualify for the exception to the time and number requirements for motions to reopen. The regulatory language in question is narrowly written, and refers exclusively to changed conditions “arising in the country of nationality” which have emerged after a final order of deportation or removal. There is no room to read in a broader interpretation, such as changes an alien experiences in the United States, or any events which occur before the final deportation order.1 The respondent’s marriage is a personal change of circumstances which has arisen outside of his country of nationality. And despite the alleged repercussions felt by his family in Syria, we cannot reasonably read the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4) as encompassing this change in personal status.
 
In closing, we first note that to the extent the respondent is arguing that our holding in Matter of A-N- and R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999)should apply to this case, our holding in that decision involved exclusion proceedings and was decided under a different statutory and regulatory framework than the one applicable to the case before us. And, finally, while we acknowledge the respondent’s arguments concerning the application of international law to his situation, the jurisdiction of both the Immigration Judge and this Board is defined by regulation and cannot be enlarged without the express authorization of Congress or the Attorney General. We find that, here, the Immigration Judge appropriately applied the laws and regulations as written. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We compare this to the exception to the one year filing deadline for asylum applications, which refers to “¿cºhanges in objective circumstances relating to the applicant in the United States ….” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i); see also section 208(a)(2) of the Act. This broader standard does not apply to motions to reopen.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a male native and citizen of Peru. At his final hearing on February 14, 2006, the respondent, through counsel, discussed his options for applying for adjustment of status. See Tr. at 47-61. In a decision dated February 14, 2006, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent 120 days in which to voluntarily depart with an alternate order of removal to Peru. On his order, the Immigration Judge wrote “¿aºny motion to reopen for any other relief that may be available to respondent must be filed by COB on 5-15-2006, with the Court waiving the $110.00 filing fee.” The Immigration Judge’s decision noted that the respondent’s voluntary departure period would expire on June 14, 2006.
 
On June 12, 2006, the respondent, through counsel, filed a “Respondent’s Proof of I-130 Filing” which was accompanied by a completed visa petition (Form I-130) filed on his behalf by his father, proof that his father obtained lawful permanent resident status on May 2, 2006, a translated copy of the respondent’s birth certificate, and proof of filing and payment of fees regarding the visa petition. In an order dated June 15, 2006, the Immigration Judge found that the document filed by the respondent was not a motion to reopen, noted that since there was no motion to reopen pending the respondent’s voluntary departure period was not tolled, and stated that his February 14, 2006, order was administratively final for all purposes. The respondent filed a timely appeal of this decision on Monday, July 18, 2006.
 
On appeal, counsel for the respondent states that he filed proof that the respondent had a pending visa petition which provided a basis for his not voluntarily departing. He notes that such proof was filed prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period but after the deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen. Counsel also states that he was not aware that he was required to file a motion to reopen and would have done so had he known it was required. He asks that his mistake not be held against the respondent. The respondent seeks adjustment of status and does not claim to be eligible for any other form of relief from removal.
 
*2 Counsel’s statements on appeal clearly indicate that the document filed on June 12, 2006, was not a motion to reopen and was not intended to be viewed as a motion to reopen since there would be no reason otherwise for counsel to state on appeal that he would have filed a motion to reopen had he been aware that such a motion was required. Therefore, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the document was not a motion to reopen and that it did not serve to toll the respondent’s voluntary departure period.
 
Moreover, the record establishes that the Immigration Judge and counsels for the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) discussed the options available to the respondent. See Tr. at 54-61. The Immigration Judge clearly stated that he would grant the respondent 120 days of voluntary departure but would reopen proceedings if a motion to reopen were filed accompanied by evidence that the respondent was eligible for adjustment of status. Id. This same information, along with the deadline for the timely filing of a motion to reopen, was clearly written on the Immigration Judge’s decision, a copy of which was provided to the respondent. Neither the respondent nor his attorney dispute these facts. In light of the undisputed facts of record, counsel’s statements on appeal that he was unaware of the need to file a motion to reopen and would have done so if required reflects ineffective assistance by counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that an attorney provides ineffective assistance of counsel if competent counsel would have acted otherwise).
 
Because we find that counsel for the respondent was ineffective, we next examine whether the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s actions. Id. Substantial prejudice must be shown and such prejudice means that the alleged ineffectiveness must have affected the outcome of proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000). We find that the respondent was not prejudiced by counsel’s actions. At his February 14, 2006, hearing, the Immigration Judge and the parties discussed the respondent’s potential for immediate eligibility for adjustment of status through his mother if 1) she quickly adjusted her status under the Cuban Adjustment Act based upon her marriage to a Cuban citizen, and 2) the respondent obtained a divorce from his wife, whom he could not locate, prior his reaching his 21st birthday on May 30, 2006. See Tr. at 54-61. The visa petition that was submitted with the document filed by counsel reflects that the beneficiary’s father filed the Form I-130 on the respondent’s behalf. It reflects the respondent as “divorced” but shows the termination date of his marriage as “pending.” Thus, this petition does not clearly reflect that the respondent is eligible for a visa since visas are available only for married sons and daughters of United States citizens (as third preference visas). Since the respondent’s father became a lawful permanent resident in May 2006 and the respondent has provided no evidence that his divorce is final, he cannot establish eligibility for adjustment of status since he cannot show that a visa is immediately available to him. Because the respondent is not eligible for adjustment of status, he cannot show prejudice from counsel’s failure to file a motion to reopen for adjustment of status with the Immigration Judge.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rick Hujber, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on October 12, 2006, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He requested reopening with an Immigration Judge on November 2, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied the motion on November 6, 2006. On December 6, 2006, the respondent requested reconsideration with the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 7, 2006. On December 12, 2006, the respondent requested that the Immigration Judge reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Therein, the respondent argued that his former counsel did not inform him of the October 12, 2006, hearing date. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 14, 2006, and this appeal followed. The record will be remanded.
 
The respondent argues on appeal and in his remand request that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. In addition, we note that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals requires substantial if not exact compliance with the procedural requirements set forth above. See Dakane v. U.S. Atty.Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Atty.Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent and his wife indicated that the respondent’s former counsel did not inform him of his hearing date. The respondent, however, did not provide an affidavit, but we note that the record contains a sworn statement from the respondent’s wife. In addition, the record contains a statement from the respondent’s former counsel, Jorge Rivera, that was provided on appeal. Therein, Mr. Rivera admits that his former employee, Joseph Lackey, Esquire, was handling the respondent’s case, and did not notify the respondent of the hearing scheduled for October 12, 2006. Based on this information, we find that the respondent’s failure to appear for his hearing was caused by ineffective representation of counsel. We further note that the respondent is married to a United States citizen, she has filed a visa petition on his behalf, and the respondent has diligently sought reopening of these proceedings. Based on these factors, we find that an exceptional situation exists herein to warrant sua sponte reopening of proceedings in the exercise of discretion. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(C), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)º - Controlled substance trafficker
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 31, 2006, finding him inadmissible under sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (II), based on his record of conviction; as well as pretermitting his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), will be dismissed.
 
The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. At the outset, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he had not shown that his 2002 Florida delivery of hydrocodone conviction,2 was not to be considered a conviction for an aggravated felony as defined by section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act3, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), thereby precluding his eligibility for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act., 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3). The respondent argues that since hydrocodone is not listed as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”), his conviction is not an aggravated felony under the Act.4
 
Initially, we agree that hydrocodone does not appear in any of the CSA schedules. We observe, however, that Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) regulations, promulgated after passage of the CSA and published in the Code of Federal Regulations, have expressly classified hydrocodone as a Schedule II controlled substance, 21 C.F.R. § 1308.12(b)(1) (1993). Moreover, we note that these accretions have the force of law pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 811(a) (authorizing the Attorney General to add substances to the CSA schedules) and 28 C.F.R. pt. 0.100(b) (delegating that authority to the DEA). Thus, we find that hydrocodone is a Schedule II controlled substance within the purview of the CSA.
 
*2 The respondent, seeks discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal and bears the burden of proving that he is statutorily eligible for such relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). Consequently, as we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that his 2002 Florida delivery of hydrocodone conviction is not a conviction for an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) ofthe Act, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.§ 1229b(a)(3).
 
Furthermore, contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, his 2002 Florida delivery of hydrocodone conviction is final for immigration purposes. The respondent’s general collateral attack on his criminal conviction based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal proceedings does not establish that the respondent does not have a conviction that is final for immigration purposes. It is clear that an Immigration Judge and the Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction, unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding his guilt or innocence. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
Moreover, the respondent’s contention that he will be filing a petition for a belated appeal of his criminal conviction, does not alter our conclusion that his 2002 Florida delivery of hydrocodone conviction is final for immigration purposes. We found in Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994), that an alien who has waived or exhausted the right to a direct appeal of a conviction is subject to deportation, and the potential for discretionary review on direct appeal will not prevent the conviction from being considered final for immigration purposes. Like the alien in Matter of Polanco, supra, the respondent has indicated that he intends to file a motion for permission to file a late appeal, but he has not shown that the motion has actually been filed, much less granted. The respondent’s conviction is therefore final for immigration purposes. In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction at the hearing through his representative (Tr. at 6). Absent egregious circumstances, a concession made by counsel of record is binding upon the alien as an admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Accordingly, we find that his conviction is final for immigration purposes. See Matter of Chairez, 21 I&N Dec. 44 (BIA 1995); see also Matter of Onyido, 22 I&N Dec. 552 (BIA 1999).
 
*3 Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that he is not inadmissible under sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (II) of the Act, and is subject to removal from the United States based on the conviction record submitted in this case (Exh. 2). See section 240(c)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(2)(A). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The appeal currently before the Board was submitted by Shahla Khan, Esq., an attorney acting on the respondent’s behalf. However, said attorney failed to file a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney before the Board (form EOIR-27)as required by the regulations, and instead filed a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney before the Immigration Court (form EOIR-28). The respondent is therefore considered to be proceeding pro se. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(1). A courtesy copy of our decision will be provided to said attorney.

2

The record reflects that on February 15, 2002, the respondent was convicted in the 10th Judicial Circuit Court for Polk County, Florida, for the offense of Delivery of Hydrocodone, in violation of section 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes, and sentenced to 4 years of probation (Group Exh. 2).

3

We consider the United States Supreme Court’s recent decision in Lopez v. Gonzales, 127 S.Ct. 625, 633 (2006) (Conduct made a felony under state law but a misdemeanor under the CSA is not a “felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act” for immigration purposes), is distinguishable and does not alter our conclusion that the respondent’ s 2002 Florida controlled substance conviction, a felony under Florida law, is a conviction for an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act. The respondent has not been charged with unlawful possession of hydrocodone, but rather with the delivery of hydrocodone, which the respondent conceded is a controlled substance under the CSA (Tr. at 16), which necessarily involves the element of distribution or trafficking of a controlled substance and is punishable as a felony under the CSA (21 U.S.C. § 841(b)) (emphasis added).

4

Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act defines the term aggravated felony, in pertinent part, as “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code).” For the purpose of this statutory scheme, a “controlled substance” is one listed in Schedules I through IV of the CSA. See 21 U. S.C. § 802(6) (defining “controlled substance”); see also 21 U.S.C. § 812 (codifying the schedules).

IN RE: JOSE GUADALUPE SOSA-RODRIGUEZ
File: AXX XX1 398 - San Diego
March 6, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Catalina Leff, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 Calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on January 5, 2007. The appeal was accordingly due on or before February 5, 2007. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on February 12, 2007.
 
The respondent urges the Board to accept the appeal out of time. The respondent, through current counsel, states that he was under the impression that his former attorney would file his appeal before the due date. However, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). No evidence has been submitted in support of the motion submitted on the respondent’s behalf by current counsel.
 
We find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15 (1999).
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert B. Jobe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sandra B. Miles
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude (withdrawn)
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on July 20, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand. On October 18, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be granted.
 
As an initial matter, we disagree with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) that the respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred, as his previous motion was deemed to be a motion to remand filed during the pendency of his second appeal, and the final administrative order was issued on July 20, 2006. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4).
 
Moreover, the respondent reasserts the claim that he is not removable as charged, and he now asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney for conceding removability. The respondent avers that “to the best of my knowledge I never discussed with ¿former counselº the issue of my removability and how they should plead to the charges” (Motion, attachment A). The attorney, in his response, does remember discussing this strategy with the respondent, and states that the respondent “had no interest in contesting the charges and wanted a final merit hearing to request relief as soon as possible” (Motion, attachment V). However, a client’s insistence on expediting a case is no excuse for failing to research and advise a client that there is no sound basis for the charges. A concession of removability under these circumstances cannot be considered a reasonable tactical decision. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (holding that absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission; and that there is a strong presumption that such a decision is a reasonable tactical decision).
 
The respondent has satisfied the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Furthermore, he has submitted sufficient evidence that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s actions, as it appears that his 1985 conviction under California Penal Code § 273a(a) for child endangerment does not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude. See People v. Sanders, 10 Cal. App. 4th 1268, 1274 (5th Dist. 1992); see also Carty v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that when a statute is divisible into several crimes, some of which may involve moral turpitude and some not, it is appropriate to examine the “record of conviction” to determine which part applies to the defendant). Accordingly, the motion will be granted, proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL/MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Olga Nazimova, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J. Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on November 2, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 5, 2005, decision to denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered in his case on April 1, 2003, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and lack of notice, for lack of jurisdiction.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent petitioned for review of our decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises. Pursuant to that court’s order dated August 10, 2006, remanding the case to the Board, we will vacate our decision dated November 2, 2005, rescind the Immigration Judge’s April 1, 2003, in absentia order in this matter, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
Upon further review, we find that pursuant to the decisional authority of the Ninth Circuit, the Immigration Judge was not “without jurisdiction” to consider the respondent’s motion under the particular circumstances presented in this case, despite the language in the regulations2 seeming to preclude consideration of a motion filed by an alien after his deportation from the United States. See Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979, 981-982 (9th Cir. 2007) (where the court recently held that the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), prohibiting an alien who departs the U.S. from filing a motion to reopen deportation proceedings only applies to a person who departs the U.S. while he or she is the subject of pending deportation proceedings and does not apply in a case where the proceedings have been completed.); see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir 2006) (reaffirming the court’s holding in Wiedersperg v. INS, 896 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir. 1990) (court found that the regulatory bar to consideration by the Board of a deportation order after the alien departed the United States applied only if the departure was legally executed)); Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365, 1367 (9th Cir. 1983) (referring to its decision in Mendez v. INS, 563 F.2d 956, 958 (9th Cir. 1977), wherein it recognized that a departure in contravention of due process” was not a “legally executed departure,” precluding further review.).
 
Furthermore, we find the record strongly suggests a case of ineffective assistance by the respondent’s former counsel. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that “¿bºecause due process requires more than the formal availability of counsel,” the court “held that an alien is denied due process when his attorney provides ineffective assistance.”). Therefore, despite the respondent’s failure to meet the formal requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we find that on the face of the record before us, there has been substantial compliance with the rule, and the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Lara-Torres v. Ashcrofi, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
*2 Therefore, in accordance with the decisional authority of the Ninth Circuit set forth above, as the record supports the respondent’s contention that he was denied due process and a fair hearing due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel and lack of notice3 of the scheduled hearing, a departure in execution of an order of deportation entered pursuant to those proceedings, was a “departure in contravention of due process” and not a “legally executed departure,” and does not preclude our favorable consideration of the respondent’s request to reopen the proceedings. See Mendez v. INS, supra at 958; see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, supra; Wiedersperg v. INS, supra. Furthermore, as the respondent was no longer the subject of pending deportation proceedings at the time he filed his motion with the Immigration Judge, he was not precluded under the regulations from having the motion considered solely because it had been filed after his deportation from the United States. See Lin v. Gonzales, supra at 981-982 (the regulatory bar to consideration by the Board of a deportation order after the alien departed the United States does not apply in a case where the proceedings have been completed).
 
Accordingly, pursuant to the Ninth Circuit’s August 10, 2006, remand order, and upon further consideration of the issues presented therein, the following orders will be entered:
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 2, 2005, is vacated, and the Immigration Judge’s April 1, 2003, in absentia order of deportation in this matter, is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

1

The record reflects the Board in a decision dated February 5, 2003, had remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), as well as for consideration of new evidence presented in support of his claim of United States citizenship. However, on remand, in a decision dated April 1, 2003, the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of deportation due to the respondent’s failure to appear for his scheduled hearing. The record reveals the respondent was deported from the United States on October 16, 2003, pursuant to that order.

2

The regulations provide, in relevant part, that “¿aº motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal proceedings, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).

The record reflects the Notice of Hearing scheduled for April 1, 2003, and mailed to the respondent on February 12, 2003, was returned to the Immigration Court by the US Postal Service, marked “return to sender, undeliverable as addressed.” Moreover, the record indicates the Notice of Hearing scheduled for April 1, 2003, and mailed to the respondent’s former attorney on February 12, 2003, by certified mail, was returned to Immigration Court by the US Postal Service on March 28, 2003, marked “return to sender … attempted, not known.”
