IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Harry Asatrian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa Putnam
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 24, 2017, denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia for failure to appear for his removal hearing on April 19, 2006.1 See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In his appeal, the respondent also requests that the proceedings be reopened and the case be remanded to the Immigration Court based on ineffective assistance by his prior attorney. We will construe the requests as a motion to remand. See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (construing an appeal asserting an ineffective assistance claim as a motion to reopen); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent claims ineffective assistance against an attorney who filed a motion to reopen on his behalf with the Immigration Court in Harlingen, Texas. Specifically, the respondent avers that the prior attorney performed ineffectively when he did not argue in the motion that the respondent’s failure to appear for his hearing was because he relied on erroneous advice from a notario (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9).2 The respondent further claims that he is prima facie eligible for asylum and that he would have pursued his asylum claim, but for his prior attorney’s failure to submit an application for asylum and withholding of removal, along with evidence of changed country conditions (Respondent’s Br. at 6, 15-16).
 
A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992). The instant motion to remand is untimely, having been filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 19, 2006. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). It is also numerically barred as the respondent has already filed one motion to reopen with the Harlingen Immigration Court. See section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 2000) (holding that because the Immigration Judge entered a final administrative decision, the respondent’s motion to remand must be subject to the time and numerical limits for motions to reopen).
 
*2 Assuming, arguendo, that the instant motion was not untimely or numerically barred, the respondent is not entitled to reopening based on ineffective assistance by the prior attorney because he has not demonstrated that the ineffective representation, if any, resulted in prejudice. See Miranda-Lores v. I.N.S., 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (requiring an alien to show “ineffective representation” and “substantial prejudice” as a result of the ineffective representation when raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638 (requiring the respondent to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance when making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).3
 
The respondent asserts that his prior attorney rendered ineffective assistance when she did not argue that his failure to appear was due to misinformation from a notario (Respondent’s Br. at 7). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Act; see also Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 802 (5th Cir. 2007) (determining that advice of an attorney not to appear at an immigration proceeding constitutes an exceptional circumstance beyond an alien’s control). In refuting this claim, the prior attorney states in her response to the respondent’s allegations that “My records show that [the respondent] advised me that he had consulted with an attorney and that attorney had asked him to come back to his office in three weeks if he did not get any court notice in the mail. The attorney told him that he could not represent him in court if there is no court date yet. I do not think there are genuine grounds for an ineffective assistance of counsel under these circumstances” (Respondent’s Br. at 13). As such, the respondent has not demonstrated that his prior attorney performed ineffectively.
 
There was also no substantial prejudice to the respondent as his motion was untimely and the filing deadline would not have been equitably tolled because the respondent did not demonstrate due diligence in pursuing his case. Even if the respondent’s prior attorney had successfully argued the exceptional circumstance of ineffective assistance, his motion to reopen was filed well beyond 180 days after the date of the order of removal on April 19, 2006. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).
 
Moreover, the filing deadline would not have been equitably tolled because the respondent did not establish due diligence in pursuing his rights or any extraordinary circumstance that prevented him from timely filing. Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016); see Toora v. Holder, 603 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir. 2010) (finding that equitable tolling did not excuse the respondent’s late-filed motion because the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in seeking a rescission of his deportation order). The respondent filed his first motion to reopen 11 years after he was ordered removed in absentia on April 19, 2006. Furthermore, he sought legal assistance only after he was detained by the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to a traffic stop (Respondent’s Br. at 2). Under these circumstances, the prior attorney’s conduct did not prejudice the respondent as his motion to reopen was untimely.
 
*3 While the respondent’s prior attorney did not submit an asylum application or evidence of changed country conditions to the Immigration Judge with the motion to reopen, this error also did not prejudice the respondent. In this case, proving prejudice requires the respondent to make a prima facie showing that he may have been entitled to asylum or withholding of removal had the prior attorney performed effectively. See Miranda-Lores v. I.N.S., 17 F.3d at 85 (holding that the petitioner was not prejudiced by his counsel’s ineffective assistance where he did not merit the grant of relief). Yet, even taking the respondent’s representations as true for purposes of his motion, his fear of gang violence and extortion in El Salvador would not qualify him for relief. Castillo-Enriquez v. Holder, 690 F. 3d 667(5th Cir. 2012) (holding that fear of extortion based on perceived wealth is not a ground for asylum); Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 250 (observing that extortion and other violent gang behavior do not, by themselves, establish a basis for asylum). See also Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 169 (BIA 2013) (requiring an alien seeking reopening to establish a prima facie case for a grant asylum); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. at 472 (holding that the Board may deny a motion to reopen where a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established).
 
Finally, the respondent argues in the alternative that we should exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the case (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17). However, we conclude that there are no exceptional circumstances that would warrant reopening and remanding this matter pursuant to our sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

The removal proceedings were conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), which applies to cases in which service of the hearing notice occurs after April 1, 1997.

2

In the motion to reopen, the prior attorney initially claimed that the respondent did not appear for his removal hearing because he did not receive notice of his hearing date (Respondent’s Mot. at 362). However, on appeal, the respondent conceded that he was properly served the Notice to Appear (NTA), which contained the hearing date and the consequences of failing to appear (Respondent’s Br. at 7). Therefore, the Immigration Judge did not err in finding that there was proper notice to the respondent (IJ at 1).

3

We will consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against the prior attorney because the respondent meets the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998) (Respondent’s Mot. at 32-64). See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that an alien must strictly comply with the Lozada requirements); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639 (setting forth the three requirements that a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must meet).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Heather Hadi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 13, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In the motion, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Brian Bennet, who represented him at hearing and on appeal. Specifically, the respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance because the former counsel: (1) sought a continuance of the respondent’s proceedings to pursue post-conviction relief of one of the respondent’s convictions, even though the respondent would still be ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), under the “stop time rule,” even if the post-conviction relief were granted; and (2) failed to advise the respondent to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent’s motion states that he filed a bar complaint against the former counsel and notified the former counsel of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Motion;1 Motion Exhs. B-C).
 
As a threshold matter, despite the arguments that the respondent filed a bar complaint and notified the former counsel of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has not shown that he has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The document submitted as proof of filing a bar complaint appears to be only part of the necessary complaint form (“Details of Complaint”) and the respondent did not submit evidence that the complaint was actually sent to the bar authority (Motion Exh. B). Furthermore, this complaint statement, which appears to be from the respondent’s mother, states that the former counsel “has not done anything for my son.” (id.). The brief email communication from current counsel to former counsel only addressed the respondent’s ineligibility for cancellation of removal, but did not address the alleged failure by the former counsel to advise the respondent to apply for asylum and related forms of relief (Motion Exh. C). Also significantly, the respondent has not submitted his own affidavit regarding the representation by the former counsel.2 Since the respondent did not substantially comply with Matter of Lozada, the motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel claim will be denied.
 
*2 In any event, the respondent has not shown prejudice from the ineffective assistance of counsel. While the respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance for seeking continuance, he has not claimed or shown that the outcome of his proceedings was potentially affected because he sought a continuance. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 860 (7th Cir. 2012); Rapheal v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 521, 533 (7th Cir. 2008) (prejudice means that the lack of a fair hearing actually had the potential for affecting the outcome of the proceedings); Hamid v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 642, 646-47 (7th Cir. 2005) (applicant’s failure to allege excluded testimony that would potentially affect outcome of hearing was fatal to due process claim).
 
As to the former counsel’s alleged failure to apply for asylum and related forms of relief, the respondent submitted letters from his mother and sister stating that they have received threats from people in Honduras who are now living on the land owned by the respondent and his sister, and that a cousin was killed in February 2017 while trying to protect land (Motion Exhs. D-E). However, the claim of threats shown in these documents is only general and vague, and the respondent’s motion offers no analysis on how he may have been granted asylum or related forms of relief based on the facts alleged.
 
Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The motion states that “Due to the immediate need for this motion to be filed all documents have not been attained such as . . . an affidavit from the [r]espondent” (Motion). However, the motion does not state that the respondent’s affidavit would be submitted when it becomes available, nor has any further evidence been submitted.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on November 20, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen so that he may present additional evidence relating to his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is also in the nature of a motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion and request for a stay of removal will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion is in the nature of both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent challenges the decision of the Immigration Judge and the Board and seeks to submit additional evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. Any motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must be filed within 30 days after the date of that decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B). The record reflects that the Board did not receive the motion until February 8, 2018. The motion to reconsider was therefore filed untimely. Additionally, even if we reached the merits of the motion, it does not assert any error of fact or law in the Board’s decision, but essentially reiterates his arguments regarding his removability. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56 (discussing regulatory requirement that a motion to reconsider specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The Board considered these arguments and ultimately found them unpersuasive when we dismissed his appeal. Disagreement with the result, or raising arguments that could have been made previously, is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
*2 We turn next to the timely motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent still has not substantially complied with the Lozada procedural requirements.1 While the respondent has submitted a letter drafted to his former attorney, there is no objective evidence that this letter has actually been sent to or served on the respondent’s former attorney (Motion at page 10). More importantly, there is no evidence that a bar complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Regardless, the respondent still has not established prejudice. As mentioned earlier, none of the respondent’s arguments persuades us of any error in our prior determination that the respondent was properly placed in removal proceedings as an “arriving alien” and that he is removable as charged. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that he has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, the respondent’s motion is insufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464. Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. at 637, requires a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim be accompanied by: “(1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the alien notified former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel’s conduct and, if a complaint was not filed, an explanation for not doing so.”).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Xiao Yan Huang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on June 9, 2003, at which time the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge of January 3, 2002. By a motion filed on October 20, 2017, the respondent seeks to have these proceedings reopened. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
By the motion now before the Board, the respondent asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in order to seek the reopening of proceedings. The attorney who represented the respondent in those proceedings was disbarred in 2012.
 
The Board may in some cases grant a motion to reopen, including an untimely motion, in order to remedy an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). However, it is incumbent upon the affected party to show that he or she exercised due diligence in pursuit of his or her claim and to comply generally with the requirements set forth in Lozada. See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2007) (equitable tolling recognized when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of error as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence); Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
Given the passage of more than 14 years since our decision in this case, and the respondent’s failure to meaningfully show that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we find no basis for tolling the time limits for motions in this case. Furthermore, the respondent has not shown that counsel’s representation was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004). Contrary to the arguments presented in the motion, the respondent was at least aware of the order of removal against her, and the reasons for the Immigration Judge’s denial of a further continuance (her own father’s failure to file an N-400 naturalization application or to even appear in court), as she was present with counsel and an interpreter at her January 2002 hearing. Furthermore, the respondent would not have been eligible for cancellation of removal at that time as she did not have 10 years of continuous physical presence. Absent such a showing, the respondent has failed to show the prejudice requisite to establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (to prevail on a due process claim founded on ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must demonstrate substantial prejudice resulting from the ineffectiveness).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not shown the existence of an exceptional situation warranting the grant of this untimely motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. While the respondent seeks to have the proceedings reopened in order to pursue adjustment of status based upon a petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen son, untimely motions to reopen to pursue an application for adjustment of status do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the time limits for motions to reopen before the Board and will generally be denied. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, we decline to reopen the proceedings in this matter and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is, hereby, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Emmanuel West, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Panama, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated October 10, 2017, ordering his removal from the United States. To resolve any issues regarding the effectiveness of the respondent’s waiver of his appeal rights, we will consider this matter on appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. At the removal hearing on October 10, 2017, the respondent, through counsel, conceded that he is subject to removal from the United States because, after his admission to this country as a nonimmigrant visitor in 2005, he did not timely depart (Tr. at 5; Exh. 1). Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Through counsel, the respondent advised the Immigration Judge that “we have nothing to apply for that the court can grant” (Tr. at 4).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that, despite his prior counsel’s statements, he may qualify for cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. However, the respondent is bound by his prior counsel’s concessions and has not complied with the evidentiary requirements needed to properly present a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Additionally, given that the respondent has not presented an application for relief on appeal, nor fully articulated his claims, he has not established that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s decision to not pursue relief from removal in these proceedings. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005).
 
Finally, on appeal, the respondent raises arguments regarding mental competency. However, he has not articulated any particular reason to believe that he, himself, lacks mental competency. See Matter of J-S-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 679, 680 (BIA 2015) (discussing a case where an alien had a long history of mental illness); Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474, 475 (BIA 2011). While, on appeal, the respondent argues that he did not understand what transpired in the courtroom, he does not argue that he was unable to meaningfully consult with his attorney. The mere fact that, due to a lack of fluency in the English language, the use of legal terms, or otherwise, an alien does not immediately understand the significance of an attorney’s decision to concede removability and decline to apply for relief does not, in itself, amount to an indicia of mental incompetency. Overall, the respondent has not raised sufficient claims on appeal which indicate that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense.
 
*2 For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to order the respondent’s removal from the United States to Panama. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on February 5, 2008, and on October 7, 2014, the Board denied the respondent’s second untimely motion to reopen for having been filed beyond the time and number limits imposed on motions to reopen. On August 8, 2017, the respondent filed the instant motion seeking reopening to enable her to apply for adjustment of status based on a visa petition, approved on August 25, 2011, classifying her as the parent of a United States citizen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not joined in or responded to this motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The motion is untimely and number barred, and the respondent has not shown that any exception to the filing deadline applies or should be applied in her case. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (2017); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), (3) (2017). The respondent specifically seeks the exercise of the Board’s discretion to reopen this case sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent emphasizes her equities accrued in the United States, and asserts that her family will suffer hardship as a result of her removal.
 
While we recognize that the respondent’s removal will likely result in hardship, the motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation to warrant the exercise of our limited sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In this regard, we note that becoming potentially eligible for relief after having been ordered removed from the United States is not an “exceptional situation”.
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the filing of the prior motions, she has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent on the face of the record. See Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 133 (3d Cir. 2001). The respondent alleges that in filing the prior motions to reopen for adjustment of status on her behalf, former counsel failed to submit supporting documentation, and erred with regard to a specific date and the spelling of her son’s name. The prior motions, however, were not denied because of such errors. Instead, they were denied because they exceeded the statutory and regulatory limits imposed on motions to reopen. Moreover, the instant motion does not demonstrate that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel as she has not shown that she was prima facie eligibility for any form of relief during the period within which a timely motion to reopen could have been filed. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640. See Fadiga v. Attorney General of the United States, 488 F.3d 142, 157 (3d Cir. 2007). Hence, equitable tolling of the filing restrictions imposed on the instant motion to reopen is not warranted in this case. See Alzaarir v. Attorney General of the United States, 639 F.3d 86 (3d Cir. 2011).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.1
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent, who is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (alien present without being admitted or paroled), no longer needs to seek reopening of her removal proceedings to apply either to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a provisional unlawful presence waiver or to the DHS for a stay of removal. Individuals with final orders of removal may apply for provisional waivers if they have first filed a Form I-212 application seeking consent to reapply for admission and such an application has been conditionally approved. 8 C.F.R. 212.7(e)(4)(iv). The USCIS has exclusive jurisdiction. 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(1). The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before the USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).

IN RE: ELMER JOEL MONTOYA-SANDOVAL
File: AXXX XX6 075 - Dallas, TX
March 1, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
W. John Vandenberg, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 26, 2017, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for his hearing on May 21, 1998. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent contended that he did not receive the Notice to Appear (NTA) or the notice of hearing. See Respondent’s Motion at 1-2. Specifically, he admitted that shortly after entering the United States in 1998, he was placed into a “family detention center in Texas” and that after being transferred to another such facility, “he escaped.” See id. He therefore denied receipt of the NTA and hearing notices, and sought rescission of his removal order due to lack of notice.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims for the first time that he did not receive the notice of hearing because the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “lost” him when he absconded from its custody shortly after being personally served with the NTA in April 1998. See Respondent’s Br. at 2-15. We also note that in his Notice of Appeal, the respondent claimed that the prior attorney who filed his motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance in failing to determine whether he had a fear of returning to Honduras, the country of his birth and to which he had been ordered removed.1 The respondent accordingly submits an application for asylum on appeal. See Respondent’s Br. at Exh. 6.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). A motion to reopen based on a lack of notice under section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act may be filed at any time. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Furthermore, the time and number limits for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings if the basis of the motion is to apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions).
 
*2 Inasmuch as the record reflects that the NTA was served personally on the respondent on April 20, 1998,2 the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent had notice of the initiation of these proceedings, and also of the requirement that he provide the DHS with his current address. See IJ at 2-3. An alien may not be entitled to receive notice of his hearing if he does not provide an address at which he may be contacted during proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d at 359 (court found that alien did not receive notice of his hearing because he failed to comply with his obligation to provide the Immigration Court with current address information); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information). The respondent appears to argue on appeal that he never was under an obligation to update his address with the Immigration Court because (1) he was a minor, and (2) the DHS “lost” him and, therefore, assumed the obligation to somehow provide his current address to the court. See generally, Respondent’s Br. at 8-15. The respondent’s argument in this regard ignores the Immigration Judge’s factual finding (which lacks clear error) that he “escaped” the detention center, and in fact, was not “lost” due to the actions of the DHS. Further, a notice of the obligation to provide a current address, and the consequences of any failure to do so, was expressly set forth in the NTA with which the respondent was personally served. See Matter of Cubor, 25 I&N Dec. 470 (BIA 2011) (personal service of NTA on minor who is 14 years of age or older is effective). As such, any argument premised on the DHS failing to provide the basic standard of care to juvenile aliens in its custody fails.
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, we reiterate that the time and number limits for motions to reopen do not apply if the motion is based on previously unavailable evidence of changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality.3 We observe, however, that the respondent has not presented any documentation with his motion to reopen showing the country conditions in Honduras at the time that his removal order was issued on May 21, 1998, and thus has not shown that a material change has occurred since that time. The record also contains no sworn written statement by the respondent detailing his fears of returning to Honduras. See Waggoner v. Gonzales, 488 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir. 2007) (a motion to reopen must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). We therefore find inadequate support for the motion to reopen to permit the respondent to pursue this application for relief.
 
*3 Furthermore, although the respondent stated in his Notice of Appeal that the attorney who represented him in the filing of his motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance, this claim is not supported by a written statement detailing this claim, or by evidence that the respondent reported the alleged ineffective assistance to relevant state bar agencies or that he informed his prior counsel of the allegations leveled against him or gave him an opportunity to respond. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, as a matter of discretion, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the facts presented in this case did not warrant an intervention of his sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In the appellate brief, the respondent’s attorney indicates that he was removed to Honduras on an unknown date. See Respondent’s Br. at 4. We have been unable to verify this contention via the administrative records of this agency.

2

The respondent’s NTA did not include the date and time of the hearing but the Immigration Judge found without clear error that it reflects that he was informed in English and Spanish of the consequences of failing to appear and of the need to update his address (IJ at 2). The NTA need not include the specific time and date of a removal hearing in order for the statutory notice requirements to be satisfied, and that information may be provided in a subsequent notice of hearing. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir. 2009).

3

This claim for relief was not raised in the motion to reopen but we will nevertheless address it since the respondent appears to argue that the failure to do so was based on ineffective assistance of counsel.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Esteban Diaz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hilary Rainone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s July 31, 2017, decision which denied his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was placed in removal proceedings with the issuance of a Notice to Appear on February 23, 2016 (Exh. 1). His counsel filed a motion to appear by telephone which was granted by the Immigration Judge on November 2, 2016, for all master calendar proceedings. The respondent appeared at a master calendar hearing on November 9, 2016, with counsel (via telephone), and conceded the charge of removability (IJ at 1). The respondent was instructed to file all applications for relief by the next hearing, which was scheduled for March 20, 2017, and he was advised that a failure to file any applications would constitute a waiver of these applications (IJ at 1).
 
On March 6, 2017, the respondent’s counsel filed a motion to continue, which was granted, and the hearing was continued until April 10, 2017. His counsel indicated in the motion that he had requested that the DHS exercise prosecutorial discretion to administratively close the proceedings.
 
On April 10, 2017, the respondent appeared with counsel (via telephone), he indicated that he would not file any applications for relief, he did not apply for pre-conclusion voluntary departure and he waived appeal (IJ at 1). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico in a preprinted minute order which included handwritten notations reflecting that the respondent “waived filing applications for relief and that counsel “concedes no appealable issues.”
 
On June 16, 2017, the respondent, through present counsel, filed a motion to reopen, along with an affidavit dated May 26, 2017. He requested reopening because he alleged that his prior counsel had committed ineffective assistance by not applying for cancellation of removal. The respondent attached a copy of a bar complaint filed with the North Carolina State Bar against his prior attorney dated May 26, 2017, and a May 31, 2017, letter from the bar indicating that his complaint had been received. The letter indicated therein that the bar “may also contact” his prior attorney for a response.
 
*2 On July 31, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. He noted that, although the respondent provided evidence that he filed a bar complaint against prior counsel, he had not established that his prior attorney had been notified of the complaint, or was provided an opportunity to respond (IJ at 2). Therefore, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not demonstrated his compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance (IJ at 2). In addition, he found that he had not met his burden to show prejudice because he was provided an opportunity to file any applications for relief, and declined (IJ at 2).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent made a strategic decision not to apply for cancellation of removal while his request for prosecutorial discretion was pending, and not to apply for voluntary departure at his hearing. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998) (discussing general rule of discouraging alien from revisiting prior tactical and strategic decisions). Furthermore, the respondent has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not established that the state bar notified his prior attorney of his allegations, that his prior counsel was provided with an opportunity to respond, and he has not alleged or established that the actions of his prior counsel constituted egregious circumstances.1 See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006) (“alien who fails to satisfy any of the three Lozada requirements will rarely, if ever, be in substantial compliance”); Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (alien must show prejudice resulted from ineffective assistance).
 
The respondent’s May 26, 2017, affidavit is written in English. It is not accompanied by an original Spanish version or a certification of translation. However, the respondent’s brief on appeal indicated that Spanish is his native language and that he does not speak English. In addition, his appeal brief and affidavit indicated that he spoke with his prior attorney’s secretary both on the telephone and in person, and that the Immigration Judge asked him about his children during the second hearing. Moreover, the respondent conceded in his affidavit that the Immigration Judge informed him that he had waived appeal at his April 10, 2017, hearing. Therefore, it appears that either the respondent is able to speak and understand some English based on his presence in this country since 1997, or that he had the assistance of an interpreter during his interactions with his attorney’s office, the Immigration Judge, and when the May 26, 2017, affidavit was prepared.2
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent requested sua sponte reopening, he has not established an exceptional situation required for sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In this regard, the respondent’s counsel alleges in his brief on appeal that the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct suggest that the state bar policies resulted in a copy of the respondent’s complaint being forwarded to his prior attorney, who would have 15 days to respond (Respondent’s Brief at 4-5). However, this information is not contained in the record, counsel has not attached a copy of the state bar rules, and we decline to take administrative notice. In addition, counsel’s statement on appeal cannot constitute evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Finally, the May 31, 2017, letter from the state bar indicated that the bar may contact his prior attorney.

2

The respondent asserts in his affidavit that he does not want his two United States citizen children to move to Mexico. However, his United States citizen children are under no obligation to relocate to Mexico solely because the respondent has been ordered removed to Mexico. Matter of A-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 275 (BIA 2007). He indicates in his cancellation application that the mother of his two United States citizen children presently resides in Mexico.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bashir Al-Nouri, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Israel, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 6, 2017, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had earlier denied a motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on September 26, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s July 27, 2017, motion to reconsider the November 14, 2012, denial of the motion to reopen was untimely. A motion for reconsideration must be filed within 30 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). In addition, the Immigration Judge correctly found the motion, if considered a motion to reopen, is numerically barred, because the respondent had filed a previous motion to reopen on October 26, 2012, which was properly denied on November 14, 2012. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that he relied to his detriment upon the statements of an individual in his attorney’s office. To the extent the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance by his attorney or a person in that office, he has not complied with the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (appeals asserting ineffective assistance claims are effectively motions to reopen); Al Ramahi v. Holder, 725 F.3d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 2013) (no error in failing to find ineffective assistance in the absence of evidentiary support required by Matter of Lozada).
 
In particular, the respondent is required to provide an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with counsel, inform counsel of the allegations and afford counsel an opportunity to respond, and report whether a complaint of ethical or legal violations has been filed with the proper authorities, and if not, why. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. The respondent, however, has not satisfied any of these formal requirements. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (“[t]o establish ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion to reopen, an alien must” meet Lozada’s requirements). Nor do we discern any ineffective assistance plain on the face of the record. See Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090-91 (9th Cir. 2010) (failure to satisfy Matter of Lozada requirements was fatal to ineffective assistance of counsel claim where ineffectiveness was not plain on the face of the record).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ninette M. Ponton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jack D. Spencer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent timely appeals an Immigration Judge’s August 11, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of El Salvador. On September 1, 2005, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on October 3, 2005. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent received proper notice, and that he had not demonstrated that his failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances (IJ at 3, Oct. 3, 2005).
 
On July 20, 2017, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen, again alleging lack of notice. He also argued ineffective assistance of counsel and sought reopening sua sponte. The Immigration Judge denied his motion, and the respondent filed a timely Notice of Appeal. On September 19, 2017, the Board denied his motion for a stay, and the respondent was removed from the United States.
 
On appeal, the respondent indicated that he would file a brief on appeal, but he did not do so. In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred 1) in denying his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; 2) in denying reopening based on his meritorious applications for asylum and cancellation; and 3) in denying the motion without a hearing. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a brief seeking summary dismissal for failure to file a brief. Although the respondent cursorily preserved several issues in his Notice of Appeal, he has not meaningfully challenged these issues and has therefore waived them.1 See Lapaix v. Att’y Gen., 605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir. 2010).
 
Even if the issues raised in the Notice of Appeal were preserved, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s second, untimely filed motion to reopen. The motion to reopen was untimely filed and number-barred. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Contrary to his assertion in his Notice of Appeal, the respondent did not seek reopening for cancellation of removal, and did not attach a cancellation application to the motion or otherwise demonstrate prima facie eligibility for such relief. Moreover, there is no exception to the time and number bar for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 Although the respondent attached an asylum application to his motion, he did not demonstrate changed country conditions or circumstances so that an exception to the time and number limitation applies (IJ, Attachment to Order, August 11, 2017). Nor did he demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief (Id.). INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
As to ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent did not demonstrate that he pursued his rights diligently over the intervening 11 years. Avila-Santoyo v. Atty Gen., 713 F.3d. 1357, 1363 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2013). See IJ, Attachment, August 11, 2017. In addition, the respondent did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Last, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening as the respondent did not show an exceptional situation justifying the exercise of the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte authority to reopen. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.

On appeal, the respondent did not preserve the question of lack of notice of his hearing. As such, this issue has been abandoned. Sepulveda v. Att’y Gen., 401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005); Matter of L-G-H-, 26 I&N Dec. 365, 366 n.1 (BIA 2014).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose A. Rojas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of September 28, 2017. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s August 3, 2017, motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on December 3, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen maintains that her failure to appear for her December 3, 2003, hearing was due to exceptional circumstances. The Immigration Judge noted that while the respondent’s hospitalization constituted exceptional circumstances for failing to appear for her hearing, the motion was untimely filed.
 
The respondent also alleges that her mother hired someone who she thought was an attorney to file a motion to continue the respondent’s hearing. A claim of “““ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an ‘exceptional circumstance’ warranting the reopening of a deportation order entered in absentia.” See generally Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 596 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). The respondent’s motion implies that she did not appear at her hearing because of ineffective assistance by an unknown person, but the motion is untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered.
 
As the Immigration Judge properly found, the respondent here has not demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her claim. The respondent alleged in her statement supporting her motion to reopen that after failing to appear at her hearing, and after she was released from the hospital, she and her mother went to the attorney’s office and it was shut down. The respondent has not indicated that she took any measures to secure new counsel after discovering she had been apparently defrauded by the attorney, at which point the respondent should have discovered that the attorney her mother ostensibly hired had failed to file a motion to continue proceedings. Instead, the respondent waited to seek reopening until almost 14 years after entry of her removal order. Consequently, equitable tolling is not appropriate here. See Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715-16 (2d Cir. 2007) (providing that alien bears the burden of proving that she has exercised due diligence in the period between discovering the ineffectiveness of her representation and filing the motion).
 
*2 We find without merit the respondent’s appellate contention that she was not advised of the consequences of failure to appear at her hearing. The Notice to Appear (NTA), which the respondent received by personal service, contains advisals notifying of consequences of failing to appear, and she was provided oral notice in Spanish (Exh. 1).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been presented to warrant sua sponte reopening, and further did not establish that she exercised due diligence in filing her motion. Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e) (5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Massiel Silva, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s May 1, 2017, decision denying his October 25, 2016, motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On July 27, 2016, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico because he waived the opportunity to file his application for relief by not filing it by the deadline on March 11, 2013 (IJ at 2). See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (“If an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived.”). On October 25, 2016, the respondent filed a motion titled “Motion to Reopen Removal Proceedings Pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). On May 1, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not comply with the requirements to inform his prior counsel of the allegations leveled against him and to give him an opportunity to respond pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639, and he did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s performance (IJ at 2-3).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that he did not meet the procedural requirements for proving an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. The respondent also argues that his prior counsel’s performance prevented him timely filing his application for relief in Immigration Court and thereby prejudiced his claim for such relief (Respondent Br. at 9-10).
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen is supported by an affidavit attesting to relevant facts, evidence that the prior counsel was informed of the allegations and has been unresponsive, and a copy of the complaint filed with the Alabama State Bar (Motion to Reopen Tab C at 10-12, 17-19; Respondent’s Br. Tab C at 10-12). The respondent’s current counsel served the respondent’s prior counsel with a copy of the bar complaint (Motion to Reopen Tab C at 10-12, 17-19; Respondent’s Br. Tab C at 10-12). The respondent’s current counsel indicates that she and her staff requested the respondent’s file from his prior counsel several times between August 3, 2016 and September 9, 2016, but the requests were ignored (Motion to Reopen Tab C at 10-12). The record demonstrates that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639.
 
We also conclude that that the respondent was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s failure to prepare and file his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(1), by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge in 2013. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir. 2005) (an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must also show prejudice); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640. The respondent’s prior counsel represented the respondent for 3 years after the deadline for filing his application for relief expired. He did not file any motions or documents regarding the respondent’s case until he filed a motion to withdraw on July 26, 2016. The record indicates that the respondent is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act (Motion to Reopen Tab D at 45-48 and Tab E at 49). Recently, the respondent’s prior counsel has been unresponsive to inquiries regarding the respondent’s case; this supports the respondent’s claim that his prior counsel was previously unresponsive as well. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
*3 FUTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bryan C. Johnson-Xenitelis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carol A. Moore
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on June 30, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s written decision denying as a matter of discretion the respondent’s application for an inadmissibility waiver under former section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and pretermitting his adjustment of status application. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen for further consideration of his section 212(h) inadmissibility waiver application based on an additional qualifying relative, given the recent birth of his United States citizen son. The respondent also seeks reopening to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture based on his alleged sexual orientation. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The birth of the respondent’s son, particularly considering his health issues, is an additional positive consideration concerning whether the respondent merits a section 212(h) waiver as a matter of discretion (Respondent’s Mot., tab D). We also recognize that the respondent’s continuing efforts to remain sober is a positive equity (Respondent’s Mot., tabs B, F-I). Nevertheless, the medical records do not indicate that his son’s head injury will have any long term adverse neurological implications (Respondent’s Mot., tab D at 35-36, 47, 89-90, 97-100). Nor do the records show that the child’s health concerns relating to his mother’s methadone use cannot be adequately managed (Respondent’s Mot., tab D). Overall, despite the respondent’s new equities and rehabilitation efforts, the adverse factors - particularly his extensive criminal history - still outweigh the positive considerations and we do not find an adequate basis for reopening. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992) (alien must satisfy “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened the new evidence would likely change the result in the case); Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir. 2005) (alien must establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought in order to prevail on a motion to reopen).
 
Additionally, the respondent - for the first time - claims that he will be harmed in Russia because of his sexual orientation. But motions to reopen are not vehicles for presenting new claims that could have been raised at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (motions to reopen must be based on evidence that could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing before the Immigration Judge); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 2006). Similarly, we will not reopen the proceedings concerning the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge may have granted his inadmissibility waiver application had she been aware of the respondent’s sexual orientation. While the respondent speculates that the Immigration Judge may have weighed the positive and negative equities differently had she been aware of the respondent’s current assertion that his sexual orientation led to his drug use relapses, he has not shown that he could not have reasonably raised this allegation before the Immigration Judge (Respondent’s Mot., tabs B at 5). Similarly, the respondent’s alleged shame concerning his bisexuality is insufficient to meet his burden of establishing that he could not have reasonably presented evidence of his sexual orientation at his hearing.
 
*2 Notwithstanding the respondent’s allegation that prior counsel deficiently represented him by not seeking relief based on the respondent’s sexual orientation, he has not meaningfully raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as he has not shown compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
Nor has the respondent submitted sufficient evidence demonstrating a material change in Russia with respect to his claims. We have taken administrative notice of the Department of State’s 2015 and 2016 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Russia. Those reports, coupled with the evidence supporting the motion, reflect ongoing and substantially similar treatment of bisexuals since before the respondent’s July 2016 hearing (Respondent’s Mot., tab K).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric F. Lorenzo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 7, 2017, denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was mailed to the respondent on August 20, 2009, to his last known address at 158-26 78th Ave., Fresh Meadows, NY 11366. The NTA indicated that the respondent would be notified of his hearing date by the Immigration Court. The NTA also advised of the statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address (Exh. 1). On August 20, 2009, a notice was sent to the respondent at the address provided, advising him of his hearing on December 8, 2009, in New York, NY. The notice was not returned to the court as undeliverable. The respondent did not appear at the scheduled hearing and he was removed in absentia on December 9, 2009.
 
On August 14, 2017, the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen, claiming that medical illnesses and ineffective assistance of counsel constituted “extraordinary circumstances.” The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed reopening. On September 7, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for the following reasons: (1) for failure to identify the prior counsel who allegedly provided ineffective assistance of counsel and for not complying with any of the requirements for pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988); (2) for not producing corroborating evidence of the alleged medical conditions; and (3) that despite the alleged medical issues, the respondent had opportunities to pursue his immigration case, but failed to do so.
 
On appeal, the respondent requests that we exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen his removal proceedings, alleging family hardship and seeking to apply for re-adjustment of status based on an approved marriage-based visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9). We decline to exercise our discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
*2 The respondent previously alleged that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a joint petition to remove the conditions on the respondent’s residency, which resulted in the issuance of the NTA and the respondent being placed into proceedings (Respondent’s Motion at 5). The respondent seems to have abandoned this argument on appeal, claiming that “several extraordinary circumstances took place which affected his ability to file his I-751 Petition,” none of which includes an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Respondent’s Br. at 5).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that even accepting the respondent’s allegations of serious health and family problems, he had numerous periods in which to attend to his immigration situation. The respondent has not established that he made reasonable efforts to determine the status of his removal proceedings in light of the fact he was placed in proceedings in 2009, which led to the issuance of an in absentia order of removal that year. Further, the respondent was taken into immigration custody in 2013, as a result of the in absentia order, and he took no action to reopen his proceedings until 4 years later. He did pursue a family-based visa petition in 2014, but has not offered a persuasive explanation for why he did not file his motion sooner or take other action. Rather, the respondent acknowledges that in light of his problems, he “simply procrastinated” in pursuing his immigration case (Respondent’s Br. at Tab A).
 
While we acknowledge that the respondent and his family will undoubtedly be subject to hardship upon any separation, the respondent he has not established circumstances so exceptional as to trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 984 (holding that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). In this regard, we point out that many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1217-18 (BIA 2000) (explaining that the burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances). Accordingly, the request will be denied.
 
Insofar as the respondent asserts in his Notice of Appeal (“NOA”) that he did not receive notice of his hearing, this is not supported by the record. The record reflects that all the notices, including the in absentia order, were mailed to the respondent’s last known address of record and he continues to reside at the same address. Moreover, he has not submitted an affidavit or any other evidence to establish that either notice was not properly delivered to the last known address to rebut the presumption of proper delivery. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)-(d); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) (setting forth the standards for determining whether an alien has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery that attaches to notices sent by regular mail); Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008) (holding that the respondent overcame presumption of delivery by regular mail where he submitted affidavit stating he did not receive the notice, as well as evidence he had incentive to appear and exercised due diligence in promptly obtaining counsel and requesting reopening of the proceedings). The respondent therefore had notice of his immigration proceedings and we decline to reopen proceedings on this basis.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas A. Grannan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mary C. Lee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 28, 2017, when we entered an order dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. On September 22, 2017, the respondent submitted the instant timely motion for reconsideration pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. He requests reinstatement of his proceedings on appeal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). The respondent has not presented a material factual or legal error in our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Moreover, he has not otherwise persuaded us to change our decision to dismiss his appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56-58; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (the very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of France. On April 4, 2014, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent to be removed to France. The record reflects that the respondent was removed from the United States on March 6, 2015. On January 6, 2017, the respondent submitted to the Immigration Judge a motion to reopen based on a claim that sua sponte reopening was warranted because the DHS and other agencies violated statutes, regulations, and procedures by failing to process his application for citizenship, and a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion based on a lack of jurisdiction, and we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that decision.
 
The respondent seeks reconsideration. He argues that the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Desai v. Att’y Gen., 695 F.3d 267 (3d Cir. 2012), which strips the Board of jurisdiction to reopen proceedings sua sponte if the alien has been removed from the United States, when read alongside the Third Circuit’s decision in Prestol Espinal v. Att’y Gen., 653 F.3d 213 (3d Cir. 2011), indicates that there are exceptions to the post-departure bar to reopening in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). He contends that his motion to reopen is based on his fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel, thus making it a “statutory” motion, and that his delay in filing his motion to reopen should be excused. However, neither the present nor the prior motion set forth a claim of ineffective assistance compliant with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 We thus find no basis to reconsider our prior decision or to reinstate the respondent’s proceedings on appeal. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Katherine M. Dittmeier Holm, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 5, 2017, decision finding her removable as charged and denying her request for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent first challenges the Immigration Judge’s finding that she is removable as charged (IJ at 2).1 The record reflects, however, that the respondent’s counsel before the Immigration Judge conceded the charge of removability at her final hearing on August 30, 2017. The respondent initially denied the charge of removability on July 19, 2017 (Tr. at 6). However, at the August 30, 2017, hearing, in response to the Immigration Judge’s inquiry of whether he thought the respondent’s conviction is an aggravated felony for theft, the respondent’s counsel stated that he agreed with the government (Tr. at 13-14). Based on this assertion, we conclude that the respondent conceded the charge of removability before the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent has not established why she should not be bound by her attorney’s concession. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (“Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission.”). Notably, the respondent has not raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Alternatively, we would affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the DHS established respondent’s conviction under KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030, theft by unlawful taking, qualifies as an aggravated felony theft offense under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (IJ at unmarked 2; Tr. at 14).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was convicted of the offense of theft of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 1 year of incarceration (IJ at 1). The respondent concedes on appeal that subsection (1)(a) of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030 meets the generic definition of theft (Respondent’s Br. at 10). See Matter of Garcia-Madruga, 24 I&N Dec. 436, 440 (BIA 2008). However, she argues that subsection (1)(b) does not meet the generic definition, rendering the statute overbroad (Respondent’s Br. at 10-12).
 
*2 Assuming arguendo the statute is overbroad, the weight of the evidence points to the conclusion that the statute is divisible. Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016). Kentucky’s jury instructions for the offense of theft of a controlled substance closely track the language of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030(1)(a), which the respondent agrees meets the federal definition of a theft (Respondent’s Br. at 10). See 1-6 Cooper & Cetrulo, Kentucky Jury Instructions § 6.18C.2 Further, upon review of the respondent’s conviction record “for the sole and limited purpose of determining whether the listed items are elements of the offense,” the language of the indictment also tracks the statutory language found at KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030(1)(a) (Exh. 2 at 8). See Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. at 2256-57 (internal quotations omitted).
 
The respondent argues that Kentucky case law establishes that KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030 is indivisible (Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). In support of this argument, the respondent cites to Cooley v. Commonwealth, 821 S.W.2d 90, 91 (Ky. 1991), and Commonwealth v. Day, 559 S.W.2d 166 (Ky. 1980). However, the discussion within Cooley v. Commonwealth, 821 S.W.2d at 91, compares the relationship between KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030(1)(a) and KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.110, and the analysis in Commonwealth v. Day, 559 S.W.2d at 166, solely considers subsection (1)(a) of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030. Neither decision discusses a comparison between subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030.
 
Finally, the respondent contests the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny her request for a continuance (IJ at 2-3; Respondent’s Br. at 13-15). An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance for good cause shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. A decision to deny a motion for a continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that the denial caused her actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of her case. Matter of Villarreal-Zuniga, 23 I&N Dec. 886, 891-92 (BIA 2006); see also Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983). Further, when requesting a continuance for the purpose of obtaining and presenting additional evidence, the applicant must support such a request by establishing that “any additional evidence he seeks to present is probative, noncumulative, and significantly favorable.” Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. at 356.
 
*3 The respondent requested a continuance at her August 30, 2017, hearing for the purpose of awaiting resolution of her request in state court to obtain post-conviction relief (IJ at 2-3; Tr. at 14-17). The record reflects that the respondent was previously granted a continuance on July 19, 2017, in order to await the resolution of her request for post-conviction relief and to research the issue of removability (IJ at 2; Tr. at 9-11). The Immigration Judge appropriately denied any further continuance.
 
Further, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s denial of her request for a continuance. As noted above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable. She has not submitted evidence on appeal reflecting that there have been judicial rulings altering the status of her conviction. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996) (“[T]he Immigration Judge and this Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the alien.”).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

After correctly noting the removability charge as reflected in the Notice to Appear, the Immigration Judge stated that the sustained the charge of removability based on a crime involving moral turpitude (IJ at 1-2). This appears to be a typographical error.

We note that it makes sense that the jury instructions track the language of subsection (1)(a), as it seems improbable that a controlled substance would be “immovable property.”

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on May 24, 2012. The respondent has filed an untimely, number barred motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion.
 
By the motion, the respondent reiterates an ineffective assistance of counsel claim previously raised and addressed by the Board in its decision of May 24, 2012. As noted in that decision, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as is required, and we will again deny the reopening of proceedings, based on the respondent’s assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel, on that basis. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Zhao Quart Chen v. Gonzales, 492 F.3d 153 (2d Cir. 2007).
 
The respondent also seeks to have the proceedings reopened in order to pursue adjustment of status based upon an approved petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. However, untimely motions to reopen to pursue an application for adjustment of status do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the time limits for motions to reopen before the Board and will generally be denied. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N 103 (BIA 2009); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Further, we decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to grant this untimely motion as we find no exceptional situation warranting the exercise of such authority. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 984; see also Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated May 9, 2017, which denied her motion to reopen removal proceedings held in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board) (Lozada). She argued the Immigration Judge erred when he failed to accept the prior counsel’s admission concerning advising the respondent of the wrong date of the removal hearing, 2016 vs. 2017, as substantial compliance with Lozada.
 
A successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy certain conditions. First, the claim must comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. Briefly, the Lozada requirements are (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings, (2) that counsel be informed of the allegations, and (3) that the motion show that disciplinary charges were filed with the appropriate authority. Id.; see also Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003) (finding the alien did not substantially comply with Lozada requirements, and therefore was not entitled to reopen removal proceedings based on claim that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel during his appeal to BIA).
 
Here, the respondent did not fulfill the procedural requirements for such claims as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638-39. The record is devoid of an affidavit from either the respondent or counsel concerning the events or conversations that took place surrounding the scheduled hearing date. We recognize that prior counsel was informed of the issues concerning the in absentia finding by the Court, as he submitted the motion to reopen, which explained that he did not advise the respondent of actual hearing date (Respondent’s Br. at 4). However, the respondent has not made such an assertion, and statements made by counsel in a brief or motion are not considered evidence and, thus, are not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505-6 (BIA 1980) (finding that “[c]ounsel’s arguments are not evidence . . .”).
 
*2 Nevertheless, the respondent’s motion to reopen indicated, “Respondent and Counsel erroneously thought the new Court date was February 25, 2017,” without detailing how the respondent learned about her hearing date (Respondent’s Br. at 4). Further, the respondent did not proffer an affidavit detailing her counsel’s failings at the Immigration Court level or on appeal with the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. In addition, there is no evidence the respondent filed a complaint with the appropriate authority that detailed prior counsel’s insufficient actions in her case. Id; Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d at 1222 (finding that substantial compliance is not found where a respondent does not submit a sworn affidavit attesting to the relevant facts of his ineffective assistance claim, nor has he provided his former counsel with notice and an opportunity to respond). As the respondent did not substantially comply with the Lozada requirements concerning the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision, and will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael C. Urbina, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arkesia Jenkins
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was before the Board on January 11, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering her removed from the United States. The respondent filed the present motion to reopen proceedings on September 18, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a memorandum opposing the motion.
 
The present motion is untimely, as it is brought more than 20 months after the final order. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2017) (requiring a motion to reopen to be filed not than 90 days after the final removal order). The respondent asserts that the filing time limit should be tolled and proceedings reopened due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board’s decision in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), aff’d, 378 F.3d 471 (5th Cir. 2004), recognized an ineffective assistance claim if counsel’s representation was so deficient as to prevent the fundamental fairness of the proceeding, but held that the alien must establish prejudice by documenting her eligibility for the relief sought.
 
The motion contends that the respondent may be eligible for asylum or adjustment of status, but counsel failed to seek any relief on her behalf. The motion does not include an application for any form of relief, and does not include supporting documentation to establish that she is eligible for relief. The Board’s regulations require a motion to reopen for the purpose of submitting an application for relief to include the application, with all supporting documentation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Without documentation that the respondent is eligible for relief, the motion does not establish prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 562; see also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party who seeks reopening before the Immigration Judge bears a “heavy burden” of proof that new evidence will likely change the result in the case, and the Board may deny reopening for failure to establish a prima facie case for relief).
 
*2 As prejudice from ineffective assistance is not established, shown, equitable tolling is not appropriate. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of our limited authority to reopen sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used
 
As prejudice from ineffective assistance is not established, equitable tolling is not appropriate. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of our limited authority to reopen sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). The motion will be denied as barred by the filing time limit.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Michelle N. Mendez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald W. Cassidy
Associate Legal Advisor
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On October 11, 2017, this Board determined that the respondent’s appeal was untimely filed and that the appeal should be dismissed for that reason.1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider and remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the motion, and the respondent has filed a reply.2 The motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
The record establishes that the respondent’s appeal was filed over 2 years after the 30-day appeal period set out at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). The Notice of Appeal, however, was accompanied by a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by Christopher Taylor, Esquire. The Notice of Appeal did not include sufficient documentation to show that the respondent had complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). However, on September 20, 2017, the respondent filed an emergency motion to stay removal and additional documents in support of the respondent’s appeal. These documents included the bar complaint filed against Attorney Taylor and a statement by the respondent concerning both her claim of ineffective assistance and an explanation of why she was still working with the attorney and the attorney’s law firm until a short time before she filed the untimely appeal. The respondent asserts, among other things, that the attorney did not file an asylum application on her behalf even though she feared return to El Salvador and that the attorney sought only a removal order, contrary to her understanding of what the attorney had been paid to do. In this regard, the respondent observes that her contract was in Spanish except for the form of relief she would be seeking, which was in English (Mot. to Reconsider, Exh. A at 5-6). She states that the English was not translated or explained to her (Id.). She states that she would not have paid an attorney for a removal order (Id.).
 
It does not appear that the additional documents filed by the respondent on September 20, 2017, were considered by this Board prior to the issuance of our decision on October 11, 2017. Furthermore, the Board’s last decision did not address the previously filed response by the law firm to another complaint, in which there was an apparent admission that the firm policy was that persons from Central American countries generally did not have a valid claim to asylum so the firm did not file asylum applications except in rare cases and instead accepted client fees for the purpose of seeking delays in the client’s removal.
 
*2 Given that the respondent substantially complied with Lozada before our last decision was issued, that decision will be reconsidered.3 Upon reconsideration, we conclude that the respondent has sufficiently established ineffective assistance of counsel. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1272-74 (11th Cir. 2004). Although two attorneys at the law firm representing the respondent wrote letters denying the allegations against them (Emergency Motion to Stay Removal filed Oct. 30, 2017, Exh. K at 53, 57), we note that the respondent has produced documents that call into question the statements in the letters. For example both letters report that the respondent did not show up for her immigration check-in on May 24, 2017, but the respondent produced evidence that she did appear (Mot. to Reconsider Exh. E at 49). The respondent claims that it was the attorneys who did not show up to meet with her at the check-in even though an attorney was supposed to go with her (Mot. to Reconsider, Exh. A at 13).4 Based on the evidence before us, it appears that the respondent sought to apply for asylum and might have qualified for asylum but was not given the chance to present her case due to the ineffective assistance she received.
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent has demonstrated due diligence in pursuing her case such that equitable tolling applies to the filing deadline for the respondent’s appeal. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 717 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir. 2013) (holding that an alien is entitled to equitable tolling generally where he shows that he has been pursuing his rights diligently and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way); Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y. Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1363 (11th Cir. 2013). The respondent explained that her attorneys convinced her that her case was not over and that they were still working to assist her (Filing Dated Sept. 20, 2017, Exh. F).
 
Finally, while the respondents could have filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging ineffective assistance as opposed to an appeal with the Board, the particular circumstances presented by this matter persuade us to accept the respondents’ appeal on certification. We find that a remand is warranted to allow the respondents to have a hearing on the application for asylum and related relief.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated October 11, 2017, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is taken on certification and upon consideration of the appeal, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

It appears from the record that the respondent was assigned to different attorneys from Taylor Lee & Associates at different times. The respondent states that she had never seen or talked with the attorney who was sent to her hearing at which a removal order was requested (Mot. to Reconsider, Exh. A).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dana Roxana Bucin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 By an untimely motion received by the Board on August 16, 2017, the respondent seeks to have these proceedings reopened. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on October 27, 2005. By a decision of that date, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the decision of an Immigration Judge of November 29, 2004, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent was barred from obtaining such relief by section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (failure to depart after receiving voluntary departure). The respondent had been previously afforded the privilege of voluntary departure by a Stipulated Agreement Requesting Voluntary Departure in Lieu of Removal, signed by the respondent and his legal representative on June 22, 1999. The respondent failed to depart as required.
 
In support of the motion now before the Board, the respondent has failed to submit an application for relief as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Further, the respondent also attempts to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel but has failed to comply with the requirements for asserting such a claim. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, the respondent argues that the proceedings must be reopened and terminated because they were improvidently initiated by the Notice to Appear issued on December 7, 1998. The respondent bases this argument on the fact that he was charged with removability pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as inadmissible at the time of his adjustment of status pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. § 1182 (a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Citing Ortiz-Bouchet v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 714 F.3d 1353 (11th Cir. 2013), the respondent argues that the aforenoted charge was facially defective because the stated ground of deportability is inapplicable to those, like the respondent, who sought post-entry adjustment of status.1 We disagree and further note that the aforenoted case is not controlling in the jurisdiction within which these proceedings arise.
 
*2 The Board considers adjustment of status as a form of “admission,” not only for purposes of determining inadmissibility and removability but also for purposes of establishing eligibility for relief from removal. See Matter of Chavez-Alvarez, 26 I&N Dec. 274, 276 (BIA 2014). Therefore, the charge lodged against the respondent was appropriate and we find no basis to terminate these proceedings.
 
There being no basis for the sua sponte reopening of this matter, or for any exception to the regulatory time limits placed on motions to reopen, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent submitted an application for adjustment of status on March 21, 1997, as a derivative of an application filed on behalf of his father. The respondent’s application was approved in error on January 8, 1998, insofar as the respondent attained the age of 21 August 1, 1997, and did not qualify as a derivative beneficiary. While the respondent now contends that his adjustment of status was valid because he was under 21 when his father’s visa petition was approved, he conceded removal in a stipulation entered in 1999. We will not revisit the question.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Asa Borts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bianca Bansal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
An Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on July 8, 2002, because he failed to appear for the hearing. The Immigration Judge also held that the respondent had failed to submit a complete motion for change of venue that complied with local rules. On April 11, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance because she failed to submit a complete motion for change of venue and led the respondent to believe that he did not have to appear for his hearing in Texas because the case had been transferred to another Immigration Court. He also alleged in the motion that he is married to a United States citizen and is eligible for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the motion is untimely, that the respondent cannot qualify for an exceptional circumstances exception to the deadline, that he did not allege equitable tolling of the deadline and would not qualify for such tolling because he did not comply with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and did not exercise due diligence in pursuing his rights. In addition, the Immigration Judge found that sua sponte reopening is not warranted (IJ at 2-4).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues the Immigration Judge’s July 8, 2002, order of removal is evidence of his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance because the Immigration Judge noted in the order that the attorney failed to submit a complete motion for change of venue. The respondent also attaches to his appeal new evidence containing an unsworn declaration from his prior attorney, the respondent’s declaration, and evidence obtained from the record of proceedings through a Freedom of Information Act request. The respondent argues that this evidence shows ineffective assistance of his prior attorney and that the Board should reopen and remand.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. First, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia removal order, and the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), or lack of proper notice of the hearing. See section 240(b)(5) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 Further, we agree the Immigration Judge that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could provide a basis for equitable tolling of the 180-day deadline. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 343-44 (5th Cir. 2016); Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798 (5th Cir. 2007). However, the respondent did not allege equitable tolling in his motion to reopen, and he would still have to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not comply with the requirements, and we will not consider new evidence on appeal (IJ at 3); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 36-37 (BIA 1995); Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (requiring strict compliance with Lozada). Moreover, as the Immigration Judge found the respondent would not qualify for equitable tolling because he waited almost 15 years to file his motion to reopen and did not show that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his rights (IJ at 3); Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344 (alien must show he pursued his rights with reasonable diligence and that some extraordinary circumstances beyond his control prevented him from timely filing).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening of his removal proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas D. Nelson, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 21, 2017, which found that he had abandoned his opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), but granted his request for voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
The record shows that during the September 8, 2016, hearing the Immigration Judge explained to the respondent and counsel that he set a deadline of December 7, 2016, for the filing of the application (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 31). During the next hearing, the Immigration Judge extended the deadline and advised the respondent and counsel that his application must be filed no later than March 17, 2017 (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 39-40). In his June 21 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge observed that no application had been tiled and deemed it abandoned (IJ at 1-4). For the reasons provided in the written decision, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination to deem the application abandoned (IJ at 1-4). 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1003.31(c). On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, concedes that the application was not filed with the Court, but explains that “counsel has committed a mistake,” and counsel seeks to take full responsibility for the failure to file (Respondent’s Brief at 5). To the extent the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, we find no “substantial compliance” with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, we construe it as a motion to remand because it was filed during the pendency of this appeal. Although the respondent has finally submitted a copy of the application with his motion, the motion is denied. This Board is an appellate body charged with reviewing determinations made by Immigration Judges. We discern no error by the Immigration Judge in deeming the application abandoned. Further, the respondent has not met his heavy burden or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
*2 permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond mat time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent tails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 12S2, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

File: AXXX XX2 461 - Newark, NJ
February 8, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard S. Mazawey, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s August 7, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)(2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
During his hearing on April 1, 2013, the respondent, who was pro se, did not seek relief from removal, was ordered removed from the United States to Guinea by the Immigration Judge, and waived his right to appeal that decision (IJ Order Apr. 1, 2013; Respondent’s Br. at 9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39 (providing that an Immigration Judge’s decision becomes final upon waiver of appeal or upon expiration of the time to appeal, whichever occurs first).
 
On July 11, 2017, the respondent, represented by counsel, moved to reopen proceedings. In his motion, the respondent acknowledges that he waived his right to appeal, but argues that he did not fully appreciate the consequences of doing so given that he was pro se (Respondent’s Br. at 9). Additionally, the respondent argued in his motion that he fears persecution and torture in Guinea based on his sexual orientation, and that he did not disclose this sooner due to fear and shame (Id. at 8).
 
This case is not properly before us as the respondent has not persuasively demonstrated that his decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and voluntary one. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1) (“A Notice of Appeal may not be filed by any party who has waived appeal . . .”); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); see also Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (stating that a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000) (explaining that a waiver of the right to appeal must be knowing and voluntary to be effective). The respondent acknowledges that during the hearing, the Immigration Judge advised him of the nature of the proceedings against him (Respondent’s Br. at 2). The respondent also acknowledges that the Immigration Judge advised him of his legal rights, including his right to obtain counsel at no cost to the government, and his right to appeal the decision (Id. at 2, 9). The respondent concedes that he chose to go forward without representation, and elected to waive his right to appeal, but argues that he did not understand the magnitude of his decision (Respondent’s Br. at 2, 9). However, this is insufficient to establish that the respondent’s waiver of appeal was not knowing and voluntary.
 
*2 Aside from the issue regarding the respondent’s knowing and voluntary right to waive appeal, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny reopening. With limited exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of deportation or removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). There is no time or number limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal based on changed country conditions or circumstances arising in the country of nationality or the country to which deportation or removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(4).
 
The respondent was ordered removed on April 1, 2013. He did not file a motion to reopen until July 11, 2017, 4 years after he was ordered removed. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Moreover, the respondent’s sexual orientation claim, which he chose not to raise during the proceedings below, is not new evidence that was previously unavailable during the respondent’s removal proceedings, as is required for a motion to reopen under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (IJ Order Aug. 7, 2017; Respondent’s Br. at 2, 8; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Form I-589 at 8). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (“A motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity to apply for any form of discretionary relief will not be granted if it appears that the alien’s right to apply for such relief was fully explained to him or her by the Immigration Judge and an opportunity to apply therefore was afforded at the hearing”). Based on the record before us, we additionally agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that an exception to the time restrictions on motions to reopen apply to him based on changed country conditions such that a reopening is warranted (IJ Order Aug. 7, 2017). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(4).
 
The respondent has not otherwise demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting a sua sponte reopening of these proceedings.1 Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable for having been convicted of an act of moral turpitude under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), based on his conviction for the offense of robbery in violation of section 2C:15-1 of the New Jersey criminal code (Exhibit 1; IJ Order Apr. 1, 2013). To the extent that the respondent argues on appeal that proceedings should be reopened because he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 9), the respondent’s criminal conviction is final for immigration purposes, unless and until the conviction is overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996) (noting that a collateral attack on a conviction does not affect the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes unless and until the conviction is vacated).

IN RE: EDGAR EDIBERTO RAMOS-HERRERA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Noemi Puntier, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jack D. Spencer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the September 6, 2017, order of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on June 8, 2017. Section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that he did not establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. The respondent asserts that his failure to appear for the hearing was beyond his control, because during the prior hearing the Spanish court interpreter erroneously translated the date of the scheduled hearing and the respondent’s former counsel did not notify him of the correct hearing date.
 
An order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “““exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on July 7, 2017. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely filed. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). In his affidavit, the respondent stated that the court interpreter stated in Spanish that the scheduled hearing would be on August 8, 2017. The respondent’s former counsel acknowledged in a signed declaration that he properly received the notice of hearing for June 8, 2017, but failed to notify the respondent of the scheduled hearing. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent’s former counsel also did not appear in Immigration Court on June 8, 2017, because of his representation in a juvenile court on that date; he did not realize that he missed the scheduled hearing until he received the Immigration Judge’s order. Finally, the respondent’s former counsel, in his declaration, stated that he listened to the audio recording from the August 4, 2016, hearing and that he heard the interpreter translate the scheduled hearing on June 8, 2017 as “ocho Agosto.”
 
*2 Based on the evidence of record, we conclude that the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. See Dakane v. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2004) (requiring an alien to demonstrate “substantial, if not exact, compliance with the procedural requirements of Lozada”). Moreover, we note that the respondent had an incentive to appear for the hearing, as the respondent received an approval notice dated December 13, 2016, for his Form I-360 petition for Special Immigrant Juveniles.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order of removal is rescinded, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary D. Spencer, Esquire1
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret LaDow
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand; continuance
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Vietnam who appeals from a January 31, 2017, Immigration Judge decision finding him removable as charged2 and denying his request for a continuance. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s most recent request for a motion to continue after concluding that the respondent had not demonstrated good cause for another continuance. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal and deny his motion.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard and we review all other issues de novo, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States on or about February 27, 2007, as a lawful permanent resident. On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred and denied his right to due process by denying his request for a motion to continue when he had a prima facie case for post-conviction relief. He asserts that his first counsel was ineffective because he did not file an application on his behalf.
 
A party seeking a continuance has the burden to establish good cause for a continuance. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 812-14 (BIA 2012); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790-93 (BIA 2009); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355-56 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. In determining whether good cause exists to continue proceedings, an Immigration Judge may consider a variety of factors, including (1) the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) response to the motion; (2) whether the underlying application for relief is prima facie approvable; (3) whether the respondent is statutorily eligible for and deserving of the requested relief; and (4) whether the respondent presents a valid reason for the continuance, and other procedural factors. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. at 790.
 
In the case at bar, the respondent first appeared before an Immigration Judge on September 8, 2015. An interpreter was not available so the proceedings were continued until January 6, 2016. Tr. at 2-4. On January 6, 2016, the Immigration Judge continued the proceedings in order for the respondent to have an opportunity to secure counsel (Tr. at 12). On September 26, 2016, the respondent appeared before the Immigration Judge with counsel and conceded the charge involving a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance (Tr. at 15-17, 20). The respondent’s counsel told the Immigration Judge that he intended to apply for cancellation of removal for certain lawful permanent residents and the Immigration Judge informed counsel that he needed to submit the completed application at the next hearing or it would be deemed abandoned (Tr. at 20-24).
 
*2 On January 31, 2017, the respondent’s counsel told the Immigration Judge that the respondent had retained separate counsel in order to pursue post-conviction relief because his criminal counsel did not provide warnings with regard to the possible immigration consequences of pleading guilty. The respondent’s counsel asked for a six-month continuance in order to complete his motion for post-conviction relief and then move to terminate. Tr. at 30-31; IJ at 2. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s most recent request for a continuance, concluding that he had not demonstrated good cause shown because a pending post-conviction motion generally does not negate the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not filed his post-conviction relief. IJ at 2.
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s most recent request for a continuance. He was granted several continuances over approximately a year and a year in order to hire an attorney and file any applications for relief. At the time of the last hearing below, the respondent indicated that he had hired another attorney in order to pursue post-conviction relief, but had not actually filed any documents with the criminal court. The respondent also did not submit other relevant evidence to his plea agreement or any documents which might support his claim that he had not been advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Moreover, the respondent plead guilty to and was convicted of attempted violation of the controlled substance act, manufacture of marijuana, in violation of WASH. REV. CODE. ANN. §§ 9A.28.020 and 69.50.41(1)(2)(C), on October 2, 2009 (Exh. 2). There is no indication in the record, nor does the respondent contend, that he appealed that conviction. Thus, it became a final conviction once the 30-day appeal period passed.
 
The Supreme Court held in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 368-75 (2010), that an alien must be advised of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. Critically, however, that rule is not retroactively applied, and only pertains to convictions that are final after the March 31, 2010, Padilla decision. Chaidez v. U.S., 568 U.S. 342, 348-355 (US 2013). This respondent’s conviction became final in November 2009, several months before Padilla was issued. Thus, he does not fall under the umbrella of its prospective rule, and the respondent has not demonstrated he is prima facie eligible for post-conviction relief. Id. Therefore, the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for another continuance below, and we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s most recent motion to continue. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. at 790-93. For the foregoing reasons, we determine that the proceedings below were fair to the respondent, and that he has not demonstrated a statutory or regulatory violation.
 
*3 The respondent asserts that his first counsel was ineffective because he did not file an application for cancellation of removal or a brief in support of possible relief. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by (1) an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel regarding the matters the attorney was retained to address, (2) documentary evidence that the counsel in question was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond, and (3) proof that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the alleged ineffective assistance (and if this is not filed, why it was not). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Strict compliance of these steps is not required where the ineffective assistance is “plain on the face of the administrative record.” Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted).
 
Here, the respondent did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada nor is the respondent’s former counsel’s purported ineffectiveness plain on the face of the record. The respondent submitted a declaration regarding his experience with his former counsel as well as a copy of a bill indicating partial payment for services rendered by the first counsel (Respondent’s Br. at Exhs. E, AA). The respondent did not provide evidence that the counsel was informed of the allegations against him or that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Thus, the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada. Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d at 598-99.
 
We also conclude that the record does not show a “clear and obvious” case of ineffective assistance. Rodriguez Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). The Immigration Judge informed the respondent that his criminal conviction likely rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 3, 13, 20-22). Thus, it was not obvious ineffective assistance for the respondent’s counsel to attempt to seek post-conviction relief in order to vacate the conviction for immigration purposes. However, this respondent would not actually be eligible for Padilla post-conviction relief because his conviction was final before that case was issued. Chaidez v. U.S., 568 U.S. at 348-355. Further, the respondent has not indicated on appeal that he actually ever sought post-conviction relief with the criminal court on any basis, undermining his argument that he is eligible for it.
 
*4 Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion to remand is denied.

The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) withdrew the charge under section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C). The respondent conceded removability under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ronald E. Kaplovitz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the July 11, 2017, denial of her motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia in these proceedings on September 26, 2000. On May 22, 2017, the respondent filed the motion to reopen at issue. In support of her motion to reopen, the respondent claimed that she did not receive notice of the September 26, 2000, hearing, and asserted that when she was detained by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on April 24, 2000, she did not speak English and that the DHS officials never communicated with her in Spanish as indicated on the Notice to Appear (NTA) (Motion to Reopen at 4-5, 14). Further, the respondent maintained that she was ineffectively represented by her former counsel because he failed to file a motion to reopen upon discovering her in absentia removal order in 2015.
 
We have considered all of the respondent’s arguments on appeal and agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding. Removal proceedings under the Act are initiated when an alien is provided with notice of the proceedings through service of an NTA. Section 239(a)(1) of the Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1); Thompson v. Lynch, 788 F.3d 638 (6th Cir. 2015). An NTA must provide the alien with notice of particular information, including the nature of the proceedings against him, the acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of law, and the time and place at which the removal proceedings will be held. Section 239(a)(1) of the Act. Where, as here, the Notice lists the hearing time as “to be set,” “the Immigration Court shall be responsible for scheduling the initial removal hearing and providing notice to the government and the alien of the time, place, and date of hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b). See Thompson v. Lynch, 788 F.3d at 642.
 
An alien may be served with a Notice to Appear (or notice of the time and place of the removal hearing) either in person or by mail. Section 239(a)(1); Sanchez v. Holder, 627 F.3d 226 (6th Cir. 2010) (proper statutory mailing of a notice of deportation hearing, by sending the notice to the last address provided by the alien either by certified mail or by regular mail, creates a presumption that notice was received by the alien). Under section 239(a)(1) of the Act, service by mail is considered sufficient if there is proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with Section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. See Thompson v. Lynch, 788 F.3d at 642.
 
*2 An in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that she did not receive notice in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In order to prevail on a claim of nonreceipt of notice of removal proceedings, as required to reopen removal proceedings and rescind an in absentia removal order, an alien has to overcome the presumption of delivery that arises when an NTA or notice of hearing is properly addressed and mailed to the last address provided by the alien. See Thompson v. Lynch, 788 F.3d at 643. In order to overcome the presumption, an alien has to show that she provided the court with a correct, current address and that the notice was never received. Thompson v. Lynch, 788 F.3d at 643. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Sixth Circuit) has looked to the list of evidence as set forth in Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) in assessing nonreceipt claims.1
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent did not overcome the presumption of delivery (IJ at 3-4). The record indicates that the respondent was personally served with her NTA on April 24, 2000, and that oral notice was provided in English and Spanish to the respondent (Exh. 1). The respondent claimed in her motion to reopen and affidavit appended to the motion that her brother provided the DHS officials with the address listed on the NTA. The respondent admitted in her motion and affidavit that she resided at the address listed on the NTA from March 2000 until October 2000 (IJ at 4). The NTA was signed by the respondent and the record shows that the hearing notice for the September 26, 2000, hearing was mailed to the address listed on the NTA. There is no evidence in the record that the hearing notice was returned as undeliverable or that it was mailed to an incorrect address. Other than the respondent’s unsupported claim, there is no evidence in the record to support her claim of non-delivery of the hearing notice (IJ at 4). In light of the respondent’s failure to overcome the presumption of delivery, we agree with the Immigration Judge that it is irrelevant whether the respondent has proven that, but for the ineffective assistance of counsel provided to her, she would have been eligible to reopen her case and remain in the United States (IJ at 4).
 
Also, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent did not exercise due diligence to redress her lack of legal status (IJ at 4). We observe that the respondent did not provide any explanation relating to what efforts she made to keep abreast of her removal proceeding. Further, the respondent did not provide any justification concerning her failure to seek counsel and legal status for over 14 years after she was apprehended by the DHS in 2000.
 
*3 Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that an exceptional situation exists which would warrant sua sponte reopening of these removal proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Overall, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution in this matter.
 
For the reasons set forth above, the following order is entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

In Matter of M-R-A- the Board held that when an Immigration Judge adjudicates a respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of removal based on a claim that a notice sent by regular mail to the most recent address provided was not received, all relevant evidence submitted to overcome the presumption of delivery must be considered, including but not limited to factors such as affidavits from the respondent and others who are knowledgeable about whether notice was received, whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation, any prior applications for relief that would indicate an incentive to appear, and the respondent’s prior appearance at immigration proceedings, if applicable.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Divyesh Gopal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mahdi J. Abdelaziz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 11, 2017, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for his hearing on June 5, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i),(ii).
 
The record indicates that notice of the respondent’s June 5, 2017, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address on March 7, 2017 (Exh. 2). The respondent states in an affidavit appended to his motion to reopen that he signed a contract with his attorney on May 12, 2017, in which his attorney “““agreed to send a motion for telephonic hearing” for the June 5, 2017, master calendar. The respondent further stated that his attorney told him he only had to present himself at his office on the day of the hearing because the hearing “““would be by telephone if the Immigration Judge allowed it.” The respondent does not indicate that he had any additional interactions with his attorney to confirm the telephonic hearing. In his motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that he appeared at his attorney’s office on June 5, 2017, for a telephonic hearing; however, his attorney had failed to file a motion for telephonic hearing. The respondent asserts in his appeal brief that his attorney’s office called the Immigration Court on the morning of the hearing and advised a receptionist about the “oversight” and requested a telephonic hearing (See Appeal Brief at 4). The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge did not return his attorney’s telephone call or respond to his request for a telephonic hearing (See Appeal Brief at 4). The respondent asserts that his attorney’s office called the Immigration Court in the afternoon and was informed that the Immigration Judge had ordered the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent suggests that he received ineffective assistance from his counsel. The respondent continues to be represented by the same attorney.
 
An order of removal issued after in absentia proceedings may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Section 240(e)(1) of the Act limits “exceptional circumstances” to situations involving “compelling circumstances” which are “beyond the control of the alien” such as “serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien.” We have also held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 24 I&N Dec. at 27; see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2007); Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. at 599. As observed by the Immigration Judge, the respondent briefly details in his affidavit the agreement that he had with his attorney, but the record does not contain a copy of the agreement. Also, there is no evidence that a complaint had been filed with the proper disciplinary authority nor has the respondent provided an explanation as to why a complaint should not be filed with the proper disciplinary authority against his attorney (IJ at 3). The alien has the burden to prove exceptional circumstances. See Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 411 (6th Cir. 2003). The respondent has not done so in this case.
 
We also observe that the respondent had been provided with notice of the June 5, 2017, hearing. The respondent does not indicate that he called his attorney’s office to confirm the Immigration Judge’s allowance of the telephonic hearing. A mistaken belief as to whether the hearing was going to be held telephonically does not rise to the level of being an exceptional circumstance. See Acquaah v. Holder, 589 F.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir. 2009) (court held that a mistaken belief as to the correct date of the hearing does not qualify as an exceptional circumstance); Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717, 723 (6th Cir. 2003); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (holding that the Board applies a totality of the circumstances test for determining whether “““exceptional circumstances” prevented an alien’s appearance at a hearing). For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Caroline L. Doss, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 6, 2017, denying his motion to reopen these removal proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on April 2, 2014.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he did not receive notice of the hearing on April 2, 2014, because his first counsel did not inform him that he was required to appear (Respondent’s Br.). The respondent asserts that his first counsel’s submission of two defective motions demonstrates ineffective assistance without need of further inquiry (Id.). The respondent argues that his second counsel filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel but the motion was not in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (Id.). The respondent also indicated that he intends to apply for a U Visa (Id.).
 
The respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, advised of his address obligations, and the Notice of Hearing (NOH) was sent to the address he provided on the Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address (IJ at 1; Exh. 1, NOH dated September 19, 2013). The respondent argues that he demonstrated a lack of notice or exceptional circumstances for not attending the scheduled hearing on April 2, 2014 (IJ at 1). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute such an exceptional circumstance if the ineffective assistance results in an alien’s failure to appear at his hearing. See Arts v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of two prior counsels does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639-40 (BIA 1988). The respondent submitted an affidavit detailing his communications with his prior counsels. However, the respondent did not submit copies of letters sent to the two prior counsels whose performance he deemed deficient. Thus, the respondent’s prior counsels, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, were not given an opportunity to respond to the charges against them. Id. The respondent did not file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the allegedly deficient representation or explain his failure to do so. See Ruiz-Martinez v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 102, 121 (2d Cir. 2008) (recognizing that, while “slavish adherence” to Matter of Lozada is not required, when an alien does not comply with those requirements in any respect, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is forfeited). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate that his first counsel prevented the respondent from appearing at the hearing held on April 2, 2014, or that the second counsel provided him ineffective assistance that prejudiced his claim (IJ at 1).
 
*2 We also deny the respondent’s request to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal based on his intent to pursue a U Visa application (Form I-918) with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The respondent has not provided evidence that he submitted a U visa application to USCIS or that the application was received, such as by a Notice of Action (Form I-797). For the reasons stated above, the respondent has not demonstrated an appropriate basis to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on April 2, 2014.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On January 5, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s prior motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal entered on April 2, 2014, concluding the his failure to appear was due to his failure to notify the Immigration Court of his change of address. The Immigration Court mailed the Notice of Hearing to the address that the respondent provided and it was returned as not deliverable. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was advised in the Notice to Appear and in the Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address, to notify the Court of any change in his address but he did not do so. The respondent did not appeal.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oti Winifed Nwosu, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Zambia, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 10, 2017, which denied his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not replied to the respondent’s brief on appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record shows that in a July 12, 2011, order, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a period of voluntary departure to November 9, 2011, with an alternate order of removal. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on July 5, 2017, based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and seeking to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (2012). The DHS opposed the motion. On July 10, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen.
 
We conclude that a remand is warranted for the Immigration Judge to conduct fact-finding and legal analysis regarding the motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen cites only agreement with the DHS’s opposition; it does not include findings of fact or legal analysis to support the denial of the motion to reopen. See generally Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468, 473 (BIA 1999) (vesting the Immigration Judge with the responsibility for ensuring the “substantive completeness of the decision”). Therefore, we are unable to meaningfully review the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

File: AXXX XX6 584 - El Paso, TX
January 30, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reinstatement of appeal
 
*1 The record before us shows that the respondent was ordered removed from the United States to Senegal on March 19, 2007. The Immigration Judge’s order reflects that the respondent waived his right to appeal the decision. On March 26, 2007, the respondent filed a pro se appeal. On April 2, 2007, the respondent filed a letter stating that he had changed his mind, wanted “[n]o more appeal,” wanted to go to Africa, and asked the Board to deny the appeal. The Board issued a decision on April 12, 2007, stating that the respondent had withdrawn his appeal and that the record was being returned to the Immigration Court without further action.
 
On December 6, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reinstate his appeal. The motion argues that the respondent did not actually request withdrawal of appeal in his letter but asked that his appeal be denied and further that the letter indicates an incorrect belief that the respondent could challenge the Immigration Judge’s decision from Senegal. The respondent argues that he did not write the letter but that he found someone in the detention facility who advised him and who wrote the letter. The respondent’s motion further presents several arguments as to why he should not have been found subject to removal and that even if he were subject to removal, he qualified for relief that he had no opportunity to pursue.
 
Insofar as the respondent’s motion is a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider for the purpose of reinstatement of the appeal, it is untimely. Motions to reconsider must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the order from which reconsideration is sought. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent filed his motion more than 10 years after the Board’s last decision. Moreover, the respondent does not argue that his motion falls within any statutory or regulatory exception to the filing requirements. Nor does the respondent claim that equitable tolling applies to his motion. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
Assuming the respondent is attempting to set out a case of ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge, he has not demonstrated compliance with the technical requirements for ineffective assistance claims as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and (as noted previously), has not argued that equitable tolling applies.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that proceedings should be reopened or reconsidered sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The record shows that appeal was waived in this matter. Insofar as the respondent did appeal, he has not established that the Board incorrectly deemed his appeal withdrawn. The respondent’s letter to the Board in 2007 specifically said “No more appeal” and that the respondent wanted to go to Africa.
 
Moreover, more than 10 years have passed since the Board’s last order. The record does not show that the respondent has challenged that order until now. The respondent’s motion provides no information concerning what has taken place since the Board issued its order. We have no statements about where the respondent is living, whether he was removed to Senegal, or whether he attempted to find alternative counsel to assist him with his immigration issues. We conclude that the respondent has not sufficiently established an exceptional situation that would cause us to sua sponte reopen or reconsider and then reinstate the appeal. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that sua sponte reopening is reserved for exceptional situations).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Guy K. Weinstein, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle M. Venci
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on March 4, 2002, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On August 1, 2017, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. Sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000); Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999). In the motion, the respondent argues that the in absentia order of removal should be rescinded and his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel of Attorney Abdullah Salah, who previously represented him until March 4, 2002. Specifically, the respondent argues that attorney Salah provided ineffective assistance by mistakenly advising him that his August 9, 2000, hearing was scheduled at 1 p.m. instead of 9 a.m. The respondent submitted a statement that, when he appeared at the Immigration Court at 1 p.m., he was informed that the hearing was scheduled earlier and he had been ordered removed in absentia.
 
We first note that, as stated in the Immigration Judge’s November 8, 2000, decision denying the respondent’s first motion to reopen, at a prior hearing the respondent was provided with oral notice of the hearing on August 9, 2000, as well as with written notice of hearing (IJ at 2). In any event, even assuming that respondent’s failure to appear at his August 9, 2000, hearing was due to the mistaken advice of attorney Salah, the respondent was last represented by this attorney in March 2002 when the Board denied his motion to reopen, and the respondent has not shown how he has acted with due diligence since that time during the period of more than 15 years before filing the current motion to reopen.
 
The respondent argues that the motion time limitations should be equitably tolled in his case because he relied on attorney Salah until March 2002 and furthermore he had retained another attorney in 2005 for consular processing of his visa (Motion, at 11). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that equitable tolling based on counsel’s performance requires, at a minimum, a showing that the alien exercised due diligence in seeking relief. Yusev v. Sessions, 851 F.3d 763, 767 (7th Cir. 2017); El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2012); Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006). The due diligence requirement is satisfied by a showing that the alien “““could not reasonably have been expected to file earlier.” Yusev v. Sessions, 851 F.3d at 767; Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d at 799; Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488, 490 (7th Cir. 2005); see also Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d at 1016 (stating that equitable tolling requires a consideration of whether a reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have been aware of the possibility that he had suffered an injury).
 
*2 The respondent admits, and the record shows, that the respondent was aware of the in absentia order of removal in August 2000 (Motion, at 11; Motion Exh. B). Even accepting the respondent’s assertion that he relied on attorney Salah until March 2002, when the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent has not shown why he could not reasonably have been expected to file earlier a motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The fact that the respondent had retained a different attorney in 2005 for consular processing of his visa does not show that he could not reasonably have been expected to file an ineffective assistance of counsel motion to reopen earlier than August 2017. See also Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 833, 839 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that removable aliens should not delay matters by pursuing multiple avenues of relief seriatim when no reason suggests why they could not be pursued simultaneously). The respondent’s general assertion in his statement that he “continued to investigate relief likewise does not establish due diligence during the period of more than 15 years (Motion Exh. B, at ¶ 20). Accordingly, the motion will be denied as untimely.
 
The respondent also urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy M. Crossin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 On September 20, 2013, we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s November 21, 2012, decision denying the respondent’s motion to administratively close his removal proceedings. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen mother and a current priority date. The record before us does not contain a brief in opposition from the Department of Homeland Security. The motion to reopen and terminate will be denied.1
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and will be denied as such. With certain exceptions not pertinent here, an alien is entitled to file one motion to reopen and the motion to reopen must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on November 17, 2017, over 4 years after the final order of removal was entered, and the record before us does not present any exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening (see Motion to Reopen, Exhs. 1-25). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to sua sponte reopen proceedings is reserved for “““exceptional situations” and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.”).
 
We acknowledge that the respondent has submitted numerous documents and statements in support of his motion, including documents regarding his ties to the United States and community, his character, and the potential hardship to his family, including his United States citizen children (see Motion to Reopen, Exhs. 2-15). However, we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, to the extent the respondent is alleging that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance (Motion to Reopen, Exh. 21), he has neither complied with the procedural requirements for such a claim nor submitted evidence to justify equitable tolling. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural and substantive requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F3d 725, 727 (6th Cir. 2007) (stating that an alien who does not comply with the Lozada requirements forfeits his ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417, 422 (6th Cir. 2007) (stating that equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of due diligence). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s untimely motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Musa P. Sebadduka, Esquire
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was last before us on December 31, 2015, when we entered a final administrative order dismissing the respondent’s appeal. On July 14, 2017, the respondent submitted the instant motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. He requests a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion has been filed out of time, and it will be denied. The respondent’s stay request will also be denied.
 
With limited exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In certain circumstances, an alien may toll the time limit applicable to his motion to reopen by demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition to complying with the procedural requirements for such a claim, the alien must show prejudice as a result of the ineffective assistance and that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to toll. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Kenya. He seeks reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent claims that when the Immigration Judge asked if he was going to request voluntary departure and his counsel said no, he asked his counsel what the Immigration Judge meant by voluntary departure, and his counsel replied that he would explain it after the hearing. See Exh. VIII, ¶ 10. He relates that his counsel later explained what voluntary departure meant, and stated that he did not need voluntary departure because the Immigration Judge erred and they were going to appeal his decision. Id., ¶ 11. He recounts that after his appeal was dismissed, his counsel advised him to seek review in the Circuit Court of Appeal, and said that if the Circuit Court remands his case to the Immigration Judge, he could apply for voluntary departure. Id., ¶ 13. The respondent states that he was confused and upset because his counsel was telling him that he needed to appeal one more time to achieve what the Immigration Judge had offered him at the start. Id. He reports that he agreed to pursue further appeals to the Circuit Court as a last alternative, and that on May 15, 2017, the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the Board. Id., ¶ 15. The respondent claims that his counsel should not have appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision because he knew that he was inadmissible and barred from adjustment of status, and that he misrepresented the general outlook of his case, giving him false hope. Id., ¶¶ 16-17. He alleges that his counsel’s false representations cost him his only available option and several thousand dollars in legal fees and court costs that were not necessary, and violated the rules of professional conduct. Id., ¶¶ 18-20.
 
*2 The respondent offers his affidavit and his statement of facts, his notice to his former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance, his counsel’s response, the bar complaint he filed against his former counsel and receipt notice, a Massachusetts record of criminal offender information, and letters from a friend and a parish vicar in the United States.
 
The respondent has not offered persuasive evidence for his claim that his counsel made false representations to him. The record reflects that the respondent agreed to proceed with the appeal and federal court review of his removal proceedings after the Immigration Judge rendered his decision in 2014. We are not convinced by the respondent’s contention at this time, years later and after his appeal has been dismissed and petition for review denied, that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by pursuing those courses of action. We conclude that, although the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not demonstrated that he suffered ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639; Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2004); Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001). We are not persuaded that equitable tolling of the time limit for motions to reopen is warranted in this case. See Bead v. Holder, 703 F.3d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 2013); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 553.
 
The motion to reopen has been filed out of time, and has not been shown to come within any exception to the timely filing requirements for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent has not met his heavy burden to demonstrate that his removal proceedings should be reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). He has not shown the exceptional circumstances necessary to warrant our granting this untimely motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, as the motion exceeds the time limit for motions to reopen, it will be denied, and the respondent’s stay request will also be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and stay request are denied.

File: AXXX XX0 562 - Danbury, CT
January 4, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul B. Grotas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 9, 2009, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely filed. On July 11, 2017, the instant untimely, number-barred motion to reopen was filed by the respondent. The motion will be denied.
 
Under the law, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, a party is limited to one motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). As this is the respondent’s second motion to reopen, it is numerically barred. The motion to reopen has also been filed more than 90 days after our decision dismissing the appeal on January 21, 2003, that resulted in a final administrative order of removal. Accordingly, as with the respondent’s previous motion, the instant motion to reopen is untimely.
 
We do not find that there are exceptional circumstances in this case that warrant reopening under our limited sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).1 Moreover, an alien’s potential eligibility for relief after the entry of a final administrative removal order is not, in and of itself, an exceptional circumstance. This is a common situation for many aliens. The respondent asserts, however, that because she was the victim of “fraud and deceit” by someone who was not an attorney, she has significant equities, and her removal would be an extreme hardship on her United States citizen husband and children, her proceedings should be sua sponte reopened (Respondent’s Motion at 14-15).
 
The respondent alleges that she paid and worked closely with an individual, Mr. Victor Espinal, who was not, in fact, an attorney. Mr. Espinal was convicted in 2009, of fraudulently representing himself as an attorney (Respondent’s Motion at 7). Despite the seriousness of these circumstances, the record indicates that Mr. Espinal did not represent the respondent in her removal proceedings; Mr. Espinal never filed a notice of appearance, Form EOIR-28, before the Immigration Court or a Form EOIR-27 before the Board on behalf of the respondent (Respondent’s Motion at 6; Exhs. D, E, M, P).2 Given the lack of representation by Mr. Espinal, we find no basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against him.
 
With regard to the allegations made against Mr. Rojas, the respondent has not sufficiently met all of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We find the respondent’s affidavit to be inadequate as it fails to provide adequate details about the nature of the agreement between the respondent and Mr. Rojas, and the agreed upon scope of their representation. See Piranej v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 137 (2d Cir. 2008) (remanding for further fact-finding in the context of a general retainer agreement). We have considered the other evidence submitted by the respondent, including the payment receipts and correspondence, but conclude that the respondent has not met the requirements of Lozada. Moreover, the respondent has not shown prejudice as a result of any alleged ineffective assistance, as she has not shown that the outcome of her case would likely have been different but for the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
*2 We turn next to the respondent’s contention that the Second Circuit’s decision in Husic v. Holder, 776 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2015), constitutes a fundamental change in the law which renders her eligible for a discretionary waiver under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) (Respondent’s Motion at 12). We acknowledge the change in the law. See also Matter of J-H-J, 26 I&N Dec. 563 (BIA 2015) (holding that section 212(h) of the Act only precludes aliens who entered the United States as lawful permanent residents from establishing eligibility for a waiver on the basis of an aggravated felony conviction).
 
Notwithstanding the change in law, the respondent is not currently the beneficiary of an approved Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative), so as to be prima facie eligible for adjustment of status, even if granted a section 212(h) waiver. In addition, “given the evidence of record regarding the respondent’s conviction under counts 1 and 5 of the relevant superseding indictment (Exh. 3),” we remain unconvinced that the waiver (or adjustment of status) would or should be granted in the exercise of discretion. See Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals dated January 9, 2009.
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chunping Shen, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reissuance
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 23, 2002, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. On October 23, 2017, more than 15 years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reissue the Board’s July 23, 2002, decision. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In the motion, the respondent argues that the Board’s prior decision should be reissued based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney David Z. Su, who represented him in his petition for review filed before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.1 Specifically, the respondent argues that attorney Su failed to file an opening brief before the Ninth Circuit, resulting in the dismissal of his petition for review by the Ninth Circuit on or about November 26, 2003 (Motion, at 2). The respondent further asserts that attorney Su did not inform him about the Ninth Circuit’s dismissal of his petition for review and he only learned about it when he received a July 17, 2017, Notice of Administrative Closure from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (Motion Exh. 4).
 
The Board has on occasion reissued its decisions, but generally only due to Board error or administrative problems involving the service of the Board’s decisions. The respondent admits, and the record indicates, that the Board’s prior decision was served on the counsel of record at the time, and the respondent in fact was aware of the Board’s decision and filed a timely petition for review through attorney Su (Motion Exh. 1). Since there was no Board error or administrative problems involving the service of the Board’s prior decision, reissuance of the decision is not warranted.
 
Furthermore, reissuance of the Board’s prior decision is not warranted based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Su. In Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General concluded that the Board has the discretion to consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on conduct of the counsel that occurred after a final order of removal had been entered. The scope of such discretion was left for the Board to determine. Id. Inasmuch as the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel affected the respondent’s case before the Ninth Circuit, a different tribunal in a different branch of the Government, we decline to consider the ineffective assistance of counsel against attorney Su.2
 
We also decline to sua sponte reopen, reconsider, or reissue in the exercise of discretion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) based on the totality of circumstances presented. Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reissue is denied.

The respondent was represented by a different attorney at his hearing before the Immigration Judge and on appeal before the Board.

2

While this would not affect the outcome of the respondent’s motion, we also note that the respondent’s motion includes limited evidence of his due diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim during the period of more than 14 years since the Ninth Circuit dismissed his petition for review. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that held that the 90-day motion to reopen time limitations may be equitably tolled based on ineffective assistance of counsel when the alien was “prevented from filing [a motion to reopen] because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the [alien] acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error” by the attorney); see also Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011). The respondent’s declaration states that attorney Su “never told me the final result of the appeal to [the Ninth] Circuit but kept telling me the case was still pending” (Motion Exh. 1, at ¶ 8). However, the respondent does not specify when was the last time he inquired with attorney Su about his petition for review.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Lopez-Ruiz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 22, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding his application for adjustment of status abandoned and alternatively finding the respondent statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen urging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He also requests a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. Romero v. INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent urges that the attorney who represented him at his hearing below was ineffective for failing to timely file his application for adjustment of status, which resulted in it being deemed abandoned. However, the Immigration Judge and the Board alternatively denied the application on its merits. Specifically, we found that the respondent did not establish the requisite parent child relationship for purposes of adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act as a derivative grandfathered alien. The respondent has not submitted any new or additional evidence to establish that he once qualified as his father’s child as defined under section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1). Therefore, the respondent still has not established eligibility for adjustment of status. As such, he has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that he has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not submitted persuasive evidence that is sufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. at 464. Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anne Doebler, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Immigration Judge’s June 12, 2002, written decision became the final administrative order when the Board summarily affirmed it in July 2003. The Immigration Judge’s decision denied a previous motion to reopen these proceedings in which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia on January 15, 2002, under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), as the respondent did not attend his hearing despite being served with the notice of hearing at the address he provided the Immigration Court. More than 15 years later the respondent again seeks reopening, averring that prior counsel deficiently represented him by advising him not to attend his hearing, because counsel erroneously believed it had been postponed. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent reiterates the same argument presented in his February 21, 2002, motion before the Immigration Judge (Respondent’s Mot. to Reopen, February 21, 2002). We will not revisit the Immigration Judge’s finding that this allegation - coupled with the other evidence supporting the previous motion - did not constitute exceptional circumstances to warrant rescission of his in absentia removal order, as a motion to reopen is not an opportunity to repeat previously-considered arguments. See INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991); see generally sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (e)(1) of the Act.
 
Nor has the respondent demonstrated the requisite due diligence to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing that equitable tolling is predicated on alien identifying and pursuing an ineffective assistance claim with due diligence); Bataev v. Mukasey, 276 F. App’x. 581 (9th Cir. 2008) (affirming Board’s finding that alien did not act with due diligence, where he waited over 1 year to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claim). At the very latest, the respondent was aware of prior counsel’s alleged deficient performance when the Immigration Judge issued his June 12, 2002, decision denying the motion. It was incumbent upon him to diligently pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim then, rather than waiting over 15 years to file the current motion.
 
Finally, the respondent has not established an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mikhail Usher, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 This case is before us pursuant to a February 24, 2016, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granting the government’s unopposed motion to remand the record for further consideration. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The government requested a remand to allow the Board to consider the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s continuance request and any other issues that we deemed appropriate. There have been many significant developments in the law surrounding the application of the categorical and modified categorical approach and the determination of whether or not a statute is divisible for purposes of determining whether a conviction is an aggravated felony. Therefore, we will address this issue in addition to the denial of the continuance.
 
We find the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent any further continuance in this case. Further, we conclude that the criminal statute at issue is divisible under current case law, and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent’s conviction for possessing, distributing, manufacturing, dispensing a controlled dangerous drug (Oxycodone), in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) (2013) is an aggravated felony (IJ at 2-3). Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in whose jurisdiction these proceedings arise, has identified two “routes” to determine when a state drug conviction constitutes an aggravated felony: the “illicit trafficking” route and the “hypothetical felony” route, both tracking the statutory language. Gerbier v. Holmes, 280 F.3d 297, 305 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536 (BIA 1992)). Although we previously found otherwise, under more recent case law, we now conclude that the respondent has not been convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to the “““illicit trafficking” route,” because under New Jersey law, “distribution” and ““dispensing” include no remuneration requirement. See Chang-Cruz v. Attorney General of the United States, 659 Fed. Appx. 114 (3d Cir. Aug. 24, 2016) (unpublished) (citing N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-2) and Matter of G.R., 929 A.2d 602, 605 (2007)). The conviction continues to be an aggravated felony, however, under the “hypothetical felony” route.
 
*2 Under the “hypothetical felony” route, an aggravated felony is defined in pertinent part as the “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act [21 U.S.C. § 802]), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code.” Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act (emphasis added). 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2) defines a “drug trafficking crime” as “any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act” (CSA). The United States Supreme Court has held that an offense (whether labeled a misdemeanor or a felony by the relevant jurisdiction) constitutes a drug trafficking crime if it “proscribes conduct punishable as a felony” under the CSA. Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1683 (2013) (quoting Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47, 60 (2006)). Thus, an offense comes within the “hypothetical felony” route when it necessarily prohibits conduct that the CSA likewise prohibits and punishes it by more than 1 year of imprisonment. Id. at 1683 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(5)).
 
In determining whether a state offense is a hypothetical federal felony, we apply the “categorical approach,” where we “focus solely on whether the elements of the crime of conviction sufficiently match the elements of [the] generic [federal offense], while ignoring the particular facts of the case.” Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2248 (2016). This entails looking to whether the elements of the state statute of conviction categorically fit within the “generic” federal crime. Id. It is required to consider only the respective elements of the state and federal offenses to see whether a conviction under the state statute “‘necessarily’ involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. at 1684 (quoting Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 24 (2005) (plurality opinion). We do not look to the facts of the particular case, but rather look to see “whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.” See Singh v. Attorney General of the United States, 839 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir. 2016) (citing Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. at 1684). Thus, under the categorical approach, the respondent’s state drug conviction is an aggravated felony if the conduct necessary to sustain a state conviction includes all of the elements of an offense that could be convicted as a felony under the CSA (21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.). See Gerbier v. Holmes, 280 F.3d at 803.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge may depart from the categorical approach to determine whether the statute of conviction is an aggravated felony if the statute is divisible. A statute is divisible if (a) it lists multiple discrete offenses as enumerated alternatives or defines a single offense by reference to disjunctive sets of “elements,” more than one combination of which could support a conviction; and (b) some (but not all) of those listed offenses or combinations of disjunctive elements are a categorical match to the relevant generic standard. Descamps v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283 (2013); see also United States v. Brown, 765 F.3d 278, 295 (3d Cir. 2014). Further, any facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed are elements of the crime, and must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Abbott, 748 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 (2013) (quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000)). In a case in which the type of controlled substance is not specified in the statute of conviction, but the type of controlled substance impacts the sentencing determination, the type of controlled substance is an element of the offense. Id. at 158-59.
 
At the time the respondent committed the offense, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) provided that it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or purposely to manufacture, distribute or dispense, or to possess or have under his control with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense, a controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog. The analogous federal statute under the CSA is 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Wilson v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 377, 381 (3d Cir. 2003).
 
Although the respondent argues that the statute is not divisible under Descamps, we disagree. The statute here is divisible because the type of controlled substance involved must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. The jury instructions for N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) make it clear that the jury must find (a) the conduct involved; (b) the type of controlled substance involved; and (c) that the individual acted knowingly and purposefully. See N.J. J.I. Crim. § 2C:35-5. Given that more than one combination of elements could support a conviction and can impact the range of penalties, the statute is divisible, warranting application of the modified categorical approach. See Evanson v. Attorney General of U.S., 550 F.3d 284, 293 (3d Cir. 2008).
 
*4 A review of the documents in the respondent’s record of conviction establishes that the respondent pled guilty to indictment number 13-08-01039-A (Exh. 2). This indictment and the criminal accusation charge the respondent with possessing, distributing, manufacturing, dispensing a controlled dangerous drug (Oxycodone), in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) (Exhs. 2A and 2B). Oxycodone is a Schedule II controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. § 812(c); 21 C.F.R. § 1308.12(b)(1)(xiii), and the distribution of it is punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b). As the respondent’s offense of conviction is analogous to 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony for purposes of removability.2
 
We next consider the Immigration Judge’s denial of a further continuance. The respondent argues that he should have been provided more time to retain counsel with experience in both immigration and criminal law, in part, because he was pursuing post-conviction relief (Respondent’s Br. at 14-16, citing Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010)).3 He also argues that he was misinformed by two previous attorneys, but he has made no effort to substantially comply with the procedural requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Fadiga v. Attorney General of the U.S., 488 F.3d 142, 155 (3d Cir. 2007); Matter of Compean, Bangley & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). As such, there is no basis to remand the record as the respondent requests (Respondent’s Br. at 16).
 
The respondent was served with his Notice to Appear on December 1, 2014, and first appeared before an Immigration Judge on December 24, 2014 (Tr. at 1; Exh. 1). He was given a continuance to obtain representation (Tr. at 2). One month later, on January 22, 2015, he appeared without an attorney and was granted a continuance, but was informed that he would be required to go forward without an attorney should he not have one at the next hearing (Tr. at 4). On March 10, 2015, he again requested more time to obtain representation (Tr. at 6-12). The respondent was granted additional time to prepare his application for asylum and again appeared without an attorney on March 26, 2015 (Tr. at 17-18). At this hearing, he first indicated he no longer wished to apply for asylum, but changed his mind when he learned there was no other relief from removal available to him (Tr. at 20-23). He was then granted additional time to prepare his application, but at the final hearing, on April 16, 2015, again without representation, he stated that he would not be applying for asylum (Tr. at 29). Subsequently, the Immigration Judge entered his decision.
 
*5 The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal to the Board unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); see also Melgar v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., 442 Fed. App’x 695, 699 (3d Cir. 2011). Here, the respondent was provided ample time to obtain representation and the Immigration Judge properly denied the continuance. Also, as discussed above, the respondent has not shown he is eligible for any relief from removal. The respondent has not demonstrated that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case or that substantial prejudice resulted. See Fadiga v. Attorney General of the U.S., 488 F.3d at 155; Khan v. Attorney General, 448 F.3d 226, 236 (3d Cir. 2006).
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent is also removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act for a violation relating to a controlled substance (Exhs. 1, 2, 2A, and 2B).

Any attempt by the Respondent to collaterally attack his conviction would not affect present removability. Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); see generally Matter of Khalik, 17 I&N Dec. 518 (BIA 1980). We further observe that the Immigration Judge’s order was entered on April 16, 2015, and there is no indication in the record that any challenge to his conviction has been successful.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen C. Brown, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret LaDow
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s June 13, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order entered on February 6, 2016. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)(2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The basis of the motion, which was filed on May 4, 2017, is that the respondent’s prior counsel neglected to remind him of the date and time of the February 6, 2016, hearing. The respondent argues that this amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel and thus “exceptional circumstances” excusing his absence from the February 6, 2016, hearing.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (IJ at 3-4). See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) (discussing the circumstances under which compliance with these procedural requirements may be excused). In particular, the respondent’s supporting documents do not provide sufficient detail of the agreement with prior counsel, including the extent of prior counsel’s representation. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639 (providing that a party claiming ineffective assistance of counsel should provide “an affidavit . . . that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken . . . and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard”). While the supporting affidavit and text messages clearly reflect that the respondent entered into an agreement with prior counsel concerning the underlying visa petition, it is unclear if the agreement encompassed representation in these removal proceedings (IJ at 3; cf. Aff. at ¶8).1 That prior counsel retained copies of the respondent’s immigration records, including a copy of the underlying hearing notice, does not persuade us of an agreement by prior counsel to represent the respondent in these removal proceedings (cf. Respondent’s Br. at 10-11). For these reasons, we conclude that the respondent has not properly raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.2
 
*2 Even assuming the respondent has properly raised this claim, we further agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion is untimely (IJ at 2). A motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal on the basis of exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the date of entry the order. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. While this period may be equitably tolled as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, the tolling period is not indefinite. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011). Rather, once an alien “definitively learns of the harm” resulting from the complained instance of deficient performance or “obtains “‘vital information bearing on the existence of his claim”DD’, the tolling period ends and the statutory deadline begins to run. Id.; Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The Immigration Judge concluded that the tolling period ended on February 15, 2016 (IJ at 2). Contrary to the respondent’s assertions on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 5-6), we agree with the Immigration Judge that any tolling ended on this date. As noted in the affidavit accompanying the motion, this is the date that the respondent was advised by prior counsel that he had missed the hearing and would need to file a motion to reopen (IJ at 2; Aff. at ¶11). The respondent “““definitively learn[ed] of the harm” resulting from the complained instance of deficient performance--prior counsel’s failure to remind him of the hearing date--upon receiving this information (IJ at 2). Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d at 679. Indeed, as the respondent concedes on appeal, upon receiving this information from prior counsel, the “[r]espondent became aware of potential grave consequences of missing his hearing” (Respondent’s Br. at 6). Thus, consultation with current counsel and current counsel’s review of the respondent’s file was not necessary to definitively learn of the harm caused by the alleged misconduct of prior counsel (see id.). Cf. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 895.
 
As the Immigration Judge properly determined, with the tolling period ending on February 15, 2016, the 180-day deadline extended to August 15, 2016 (IJ at 2). The May 4, 2017, motion is therefore untimely.
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that the circumstances surrounding his failure to appear amount to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of the Act. “The term “‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act (emphasis added); see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996). The “particularized facts presented in each case” are relevant to determining whether the respondent has established “exceptional circumstances,” and the “plain language of the statute indicates that this is a difficult burden to meet.” Arredondo v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 801, 806 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
*3 As an initial matter, we emphasize that this is not a case where the respondent was misinformed by his attorney, either that there was no hearing or that the hearing was on an incorrect date. Cf Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 896 (9th Cir. 2003), as amended, 339 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 474 (BIA 1996). Nor is this a case where the respondent was uninformed of a hearing date after notice was provided to his attorney. To the contrary, the respondent admits receiving the Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings advising him of the February 6, 2016, hearing before the Seattle Immigration Court (Exh. 2; Aff. at ¶¶7-8). The correct hearing date and time were therefore conveyed to the respondent, and this information was not contradicted by any actions of prior counsel.
 
While we recognize that the respondent eventually gave the original copy of the hearing notice to prior counsel (Aff. at ¶¶7-10), the respondent’s later confusion about the hearing date and his own lack of record keeping were not beyond his control (IJ at 4). Furthermore, despite the respondent’s claim that prior counsel failed to respond to his inquiries regarding the hearing status, the respondent always had the option, which he never exercised, of contacting the Immigration Court to learn the details of this hearing (Id. at 3).3 Considering the record in its entirety, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances within the meaning of section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
For these reasons, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (as a general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach).
 
In conclusion, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to not exercise his sua sponte reopening authority in this case (IJ at 4). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent potentially becoming eligible for additional relief after the period for timely reopening expired does establish exceptional circumstances so as to provide a basis for granting reopening sua sponte (cf. Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

There is no record of prior counsel entering an appearance in these proceedings.

2

We do not share in the Immigration Judge’s concerns regarding the lack of notice to prior counsel and the lack of a complaint to appropriate disciplinary authorities (IJ at 3-4), in light of the evidence presented that prior counsel has been suspended from the practice of law (Mot. at 58). See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 896-97 (9th Cir. 2008) (excusing compliance with these requirements as futile under similar circumstances).

3

Additionally, while we recognize the respondent’s contention that he did not know his alien identification number (A-number) (Aff. at ¶10), there is is a considerable difference between being denied access to information for not providing an A-number and not making any attempt to contact the Immigration Court.

File: AXXX XX0 019 - San Diego, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James B. Rudolph, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amelia C. Anderson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 29, 2014, which denied his motion to reopen removal proceedings. Pursuant to the Board’s October 11, 2016, remand, the Immigration Judge issued another decision on June 22, 2017,1 further specifying the reasons for denying the motion to reopen. Thereafter, the parties provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record shows that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) placed the respondent in removal proceedings with personal service of the Notice to Appear on August 12, 2013, alleging that he was a native and citizen of Mexico and charging him as inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2012) (present without being admitted or paroled) (Exh. 1). The record indicates that the respondent, who was represented by counsel, admitted the allegations and conceded the charge. On May 28, 2014, the respondent applied solely for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, which the Immigration Judge granted with an alternate order of removal to Mexico.
 
The respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen on September 30, 2014, alleging ineffective assistance from former counsel. The DHS opposed the motion. In the October 29, 2014, decision, the Immigration Judge adopted the reasoning from the DHS opposition and denied the motion to reopen without further reasoning.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s June 22, 2017, denial of the motion to reopen. The motion is untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent concedes that the motion is untimely but contends that the 90-day filing requirement should be equitably tolled on account of ineffective assistance from former counsel. However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), because he has not filed a complaint concerning former counsel with the State bar or reasonably explained why.
 
*2 In this regard, the respondent argues that filing a bar complaint is not required because former counsel has been substantially compliant because he has responded to the letter from current counsel and because he provided a reason for not filing a motion to suppress. Respondent’s Br. at 6-7. However, in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, “substantial compliance” with the Lozada requirements generally refers to substantial compliance by the complaining party, the respondent, not the attorney whose competence is being challenged.
 
In addition, to date, the respondent has not substantiated at all the allegation that he was the subject of racial or ethnic profiling by local police, which is the underlying basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Thus, there is no sufficient basis to absolve the respondent from filing a State bar complaint against his former attorney or, by extension, to equitably toll the filing deadline for the motion to reopen.
 
We note that the respondent states in the brief on appeal that former counsel was suspended from the practice of law on November 13, 2014, and on December 21, 2015, and was disbarred on August 14, 2016. Respondent’s Br. at 7. However, those disciplinary actions do not relieve the respondent of complying with the bar complaint requirement when he filed his motion to reopen on September 30, 2014. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2009).
 
In conclusion, we agree that the motion to reopen is untimely and that the respondent has not shown that the 90-day filing requirement should be equitably tolled. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent a continuance on May 8, 2017, so he could have an opportunity to retain counsel. The respondent was not able to retain counsel. On May 18, 2017, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and, as the respondent did not appear eligible for any form of relief, he ordered the respondent removed (IJ at 2). On appeal the respondent, now represented by counsel, alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that his actions before the Immigration Judge, when he appeared pro se, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel as he did not request a continuance to renew his DACA status (Respondent’s Br. at 5-8).
 
The respondent cannot claim ineffective assistance by counsel due to his own conduct while he proceeded pro se. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable as charged and that there is no relief available to him.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Randy Alexander, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on November 30, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s January 27, 2016, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the order of removal entered in absentia on May 2, 2006. On April 24, 2017, the respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador filed the present request for reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent does not dispute that the present motion exceeds the time limits applicable to motions to reopen. Rather, he contends that such limits should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance from former counsel. The respondent asserts that, but for former counsel’s deficient performance, he would have succeeded on his asserted lack of proper notice claim on appeal before the Board.
 
However, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing a claim against former counsel, including the requirement that he show prejudice resulting from former counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (noting that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (proving prejudice requires the petitioner to make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief the sought).
 
It is undisputed that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, which included the date, time, and place of his scheduled hearing and was read to him in Spanish. As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent’s claimed inability to understand that he was required to appear in court as directed does not defeat the fact that the respondent was personally served with and received proper notice of the date, time, and place of his May 2006 scheduled hearing (I.J. at 2), which was not reversed by the Board.
 
Moreover, the respondent has proffered no argument or evidence addressing the full breadth of both the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s reasoning, namely that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in waiting more than 9 years to file a motion to reopen and rescind the May 2006 in absentia removal order. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that, absent counsel’s alleged deficient performance, he would have succeeded on appeal before the Board. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d at 85.
 
*2 Moreover, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv), the respondent does not need to have his removal proceedings reopened to be able to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). We also note that the respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while any waiver or provisional waiver application is pending before the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).
 
The respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of the present motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reconsideration of the prior Board decision or reopening of these proceedings in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s sua sponte power is limited to exceptional circumstances). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Becki A. Jacobson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Luciana Dubuc
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 24, 2017, which denied his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on July 1, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a motion for summary affirmance in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed (i) within 180 days after the date of the removal order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (ii) at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
On appeal, the respondent abandons his lack of notice claim. He admits that he received notice of his hearing on July 1, 2005, but he did not appear because he was afraid that he would be returned to Brazil (Respondent’s Br. at 7). On appeal, the respondent also filed a motion to remand in order to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions (Respondent’s Br. at 20-21). The respondent argues that his prior counsel provided him ineffective assistance when he failed to investigate and explore other potential applications for relief (Respondent’s Br. at 8, 15-19).
 
The respondent conceded that he received notice of his hearing on July 1, 2005, that he did not appear at the hearing to avoid removal, and that his motion to reopen was untimely (Respondent’s Appeal; Respondent’s Declaration). We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received effective notice of the July 1, 2005, hearing. It follows that the respondent’s motion did not meet the statutory grounds for rescission of his order of removal under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 An alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order need not first rescind the order before seeking reopening of the proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered. Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013). Although the Immigration Judge’s order did not specifically address this issue, we discern no basis for a remand, inasmuch as the respondent’s motion did not establish changed country conditions in Brazil arising after the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 1, 2005. The respondent’s declaration indicates that he owed an unscrupulous lender a large sum of money in 2005 and that he paid off the debt he owed (Respondent’s Declaration at 3). In his declaration, he also asserted that he fears of general violence and corruption in Brazil based on reports from friends (Respondent’s Declaration at 4-5). The respondent did not provide any country conditions reports from which to compare the country conditions in Brazil in 2005 and the country conditions in 2017. Therefore, the respondent did not present prima facie evidence of changed country conditions arising in the respondent’s country of nationality or country to which removal was ordered. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 981 (BIA 1997); see also Singh v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 220, 222-23 (5th Cir. 2016) (new threats and violence experienced by the alien’s mother amounted to a change in personal circumstances); Ramos-Lopez v. Lynch, 823 F.3d 1024, 1026 (5th Cir. 2016) (noting that the alien’s briefing does not compare in any meaningful way the conditions in her home country in 1998 and 2013, therefore, she did not present material evidence of changed country conditions).
 
The respondent argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by filing the motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal without reviewing the respondent’s immigration file, preparing affidavits, or submitting evidence supporting the motion (Respondent’s Br. at 15-19). Based on his prior attorney’s ineffective performance, the respondent requests remand and reopening in order to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We assume that the respondent met the procedural requirements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board and requiring a showing of prejudice). However, as discussed above, the respondent did not establish that he was prejudiced because he did not establish a prima facie case showing that changed country conditions arising in Brazil since 2005 have caused him to fear future harm or persecution in Brazil in 2017. Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding substantial prejudice is required to show ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 40.
 
*3 The respondent indicates that he is the beneficiary of an approved Petition for Alien Relative, Form I-130, filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. We note that effective August 29, 2016, new rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers were implemented. See Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility, 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,255-56, 50,262 (July 29, 2016). The DHS has amended the rule to allow individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers if they have filed an application seeking consent to reapply for admission and such an application has been conditionally approved by the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv). Thus, the respondent does not need to have his removal proceedings reopened to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the USCIS. The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before the USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
David Landry, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of Guatemala, filed a timely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 2, 2017, decision ordering them removed from the United States to Guatemala. The respondents also filed a motion to remand the proceedings to the Immigration Court to allow the lead respondent (hereinafter “the respondent”)1 an opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that prior counsel provided her with ineffective assistance by not seeking asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture on her behalf. The respondent asserts that former counsel did not inform her of the possibility of applying for these forms of relief although she told him she was afraid to return to Guatemala, and he misrepresented to the Immigration Judge that they had discussed the possibility of such relief (Tr. at 20, 25-26). The respondent’s motion is accompanied by a completed Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal; a State Bar of California Attorney Complaint Form, a copy of which was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel; and declarations from the respondent, the respondent’s husband, and the Spanish/English translator employed by current counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 537 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
The Board has limited ability to engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The determination whether the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel and, if so, whether she was prejudiced involves findings of fact. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that alien must show prejudice in order to prevail on ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Therefore, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Divyesh R. Gopal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christine H. Kim
Law Clerk
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On April 7, 2017, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind a January 10, 2003, in absentia order of removal. The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, now appeals. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In general, an alien may file one motion to reopen, and any such motion must be filed within 90 days of the entry of the final administrative order of removal. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) (2012); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The Act and regulations provide an exception to the general rule in the case of an alien who seeks to rescind an in absentia order of removal. An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded only by a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances, or a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that she did not receive notice in accordance with section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. See section 240(c)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The Board and the Immigration Courts also have reopened cases filed more than 90 days after a final administrative order in which an alien proves that his claim was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and when the motion was filed within a reasonable time after discovering the ineffective assistance. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion because the respondent did not demonstrate that she did not receive notice of her January 10, 2003, hearing. The record reflects that the Notice to Appear, which was personally served on the respondent on August 13, 2002, indicated that the respondent’s next hearing was scheduled for January 10, 2003, in Harlingen, Texas (IJ at 1). The Certificate of Service bears the respondent’s signature and indicates that she was provided oral notice in Spanish of the consequences of her failure to appear (IJ at 1; Exh. 1).
 
*2 The respondent concedes that the Notice to Appear contained the time, date, and location of the hearing, but contends that she did not understand the consequences of her failure to appear due to the immigration officer’s poor Spanish translation (IJ at 1; Respondent’s Br. at 3, 14-15, 17, 20, 21; Motion at 8). We are not persuaded by this argument. In her supporting affidavit the respondent indicated that she sought the help of Cejas Enterprise, INC, to file a change of address form because she did not understand English (IJ at 2; Motion to Reopen, Tab F). The warning regarding the change of address requirement is in the paragraph entitled “Failure to appear,” which also informs the alien that a removal order may be issued if the alien fails “to attend the hearing at the time and place designated on this notice.” Given that the warnings are in the same paragraph, we are not persuaded that the respondent understood she had to file a change of address form but did not understand the consequences of her failure to appear (Respondent’s Br. at 20). Additionally, the respondent’s argument that she was not informed of the right to a change of venue has no bearing on whether she received notice of her January 10, 2003, hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 3, 16; Motion at 9).
 
We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that equitable tolling of the filing deadline was not warranted in the respondent’s case because the respondent did not demonstrate reasonable diligence (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 22). In Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, recognized that under its equitable tolling standard “a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: ‘(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.”DD’ Id. at 344. See also Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010) (citing Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 418 (2005)). Taking this case law into consideration, we conclude that equitable tolling is not warranted in the respondent’s case because she did not demonstrate that she pursued her rights with “reasonable diligence.” Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344. The respondent acknowledged that she did not seek legal advice until 2012, when she and her husband retained their former counsel to file a motion to reopen and a Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) based on their 2012 marriage (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 4-5; Motion at 4, Tab F).
 
*3 The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge violated her due process rights because she did not consider the totality of the circumstances when she denied the motion to reopen for lack of exceptional circumstances (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 21-22, 24-25). The respondent states that her life in the years after her in absentia order of removal was dedicated to taking care of her husband, who had health issues, and her children (Respondent’s Br. at 21; Motion at 14). She also claims that her former counsel’s failure to file a motion to reopen in 2012 amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and added to her immigration dilemma (Respondent’s Br. at 25).
 
Our review of the record does not reflect that the Immigration Judge violated the respondent’s due process rights. See Bouchikhi v. Holder, 676 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir. 2012) (explaining that to prevail on a due process violation claim the respondent must show substantial prejudice); see also Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983). The respondent did not explain how her husband’s health issues prevented her from attending her January 10, 2003, hearing.1 Her desire not to be separated from her husband and children does not excuse her failure to appear, and does not amount to an exceptional circumstance (Respondent’s Br. at 7; Motion at 14). Further, to extent the respondent relies on her former counsel’s ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to file a motion to reopen in 2012, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the failure to file a motion in 2012 has no bearing on why the respondent failed to appear at her January 10, 2003, hearing (IJ at 2 n1; Respondent’s Br. at 7, 23, 25; Motion at 13). Finally, as stated previously, a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. The respondent filed her motion on March 20, 2017, more than 14 years after the in absentia order of removal (IJ at 2). Considering the totality of the circumstances, we are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen violated the respondent’s due process rights.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The medical records provided with the respondent’s motion to reopen are from 2009. Thus, it is unclear how the husband’s health issues impacted the respondent’s failure to appear at her January 10, 2003, hearing.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kerry E. Doyle, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 25, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his applications adjustment of status and voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen due to the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has established that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s deficient performance including not calling the respondent to testify and not providing more evidence in support of his applications for relief. Further, the respondent’s sole conviction for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor and failing to stop for police, while very serious, occurred 9 years ago. In light of the evidence presented, the respondent positive equities, and the non-opposition by the DHS, we will grant the motion and remand the proceedings to provide the respondent a further opportunity to pursue relief. We do not express an opinion on the merits of the respondent’s entitlement to relief. On remand, the Immigration Judge may receive any additional evidence he deems appropriate to the full resolution of this matter. Accordingly, the motion will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Katherine N. Kayemba-Watson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa Putnam
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of July 6, 2017. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s June 16, 2017, motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on April 5, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen alleges that her failure to appear for her April 5, 2012, hearing was due to exceptional circumstances. Specifically, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel insofar as Ms. Kathy Garzon, a paralegal posing as an attorney, failed to file a motion for a change of venue after being paid by the respondent to do so. A claim of “ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an ‘exceptional circumstance’ warranting the reopening of a deportation order entered in absentia.” See generally Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 596 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).
 
A motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion claiming that she did not appear at her hearing because of ineffective assistance by Ms. Garzon, was untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered.
 
As the Immigration Judge properly found, the respondent here has not demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her claim. The respondent stated in her affidavit supporting her motion to reopen that after failing to appear at her hearing, she received the order entered in absentia. The respondent on appeal argues that she thought she had no redress, but she has not explained what prompted her eventually to contact her current counsel. The respondent has not indicated that she took any measures to secure new counsel after discovering she had been ordered removed, at which point the respondent should have discovered that Ms. Garzon had failed to file a motion to change venue. Instead, the respondent waited to seek reopening until over 5 years after entry of her removal order. Consequently, equitable tolling is not appropriate here. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344-45 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
*2 Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contention, the Immigration Judge did not reach any determination regarding whether the respondent’s receipt of ineffective assistance of counsel constituted exceptional circumstances. Moreover, while the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not established changed country conditions to warrant reopening of an untimely motion to reopen, the respondent has not contested this finding on appeal, and thus that issue is deemed abandoned. See Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e) (5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George C. Maroun Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rod Wolthoff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 24, 2017, which denied his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on July 26, 2004. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent abandons his argument that he did not receive notice and argues that exceptional circumstances and equitable tolling warrant reopening in this case (Respondent’s Attachment to the EOIR-26). He asserts that he hired a “notario” or an immigration consultant to file motion to change the venue of his immigration case but the motion was not filed and the consultant disappeared (Id.). The respondent also seeks sua sponte reopening so he may apply for asylum (Id.).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge, for the reasons articulated in his July 24, 2017, decision, that the respondent’s motion did not meet the statutory grounds for rescission of his order of removal under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), by showing either that he had not received notice of his hearing or that he was unable to attend his hearing due to exceptional circumstances (IJ at 1-3). See Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
The DHS personally served the Notice to Appear (NTA) on the respondent on May 25, 2004, which provided the respondent a notice of hearing for the hearing held on July 26, 2004 in Harlingen, Texas (Exh. 1). The NTA indicates that the respondent received oral notice of the contents of the NTA in the Portuguese language on May 25, 2004 (Exh. 1). The respondent did not appear for the hearing, and the Immigration Judge ordered him removed in absentia. The respondent filed his motion to reopen on June 21, 2017. The respondent did not file his motion to reopen within 180 days of the issuance of the in absentia order of removal in his case. He therefore did not meet the requirement for rescission by establishing “exceptional circumstances” for failing to appear at his hearing. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 The respondent argues that he demonstrated exceptional circumstances because an immigration consultant falsely claimed that he had filed a motion to change venue with the Immigration Court on the respondent’s behalf and then disappeared. As the Immigration Judge noted, ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute exceptional circumstances 240(e)(1) of the Act, justifying reopening under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 951-55 (5th Cir. 2012). However, even if the respondent’s motion was supported by evidence of faulty advice by an immigration consultant, an alien’s decision to heed the advice of an immigration consultant over the instructions provided by an Immigration Judge, or immigration officer, regarding the requirement to attend a scheduled hearing does not constitute an exceptional circumstance under the Act (Motion to reopen, Tabs A-B). See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting that “an alien must make an initial showing of substantial prejudice” to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not demonstrated that his case merits equitable tolling the deadline for filing a motion to reopen (IJ at 2-3). The respondent received notice of his hearing two months before the date of his hearing. The respondent’s 13-year delay in filing his motion to reopen does not establish that he acted with due diligence to protect his rights. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016) (an alien must establish that he pursued his or her rights with “reasonable diligence” and that his failure to appear was beyond his control); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33, 36 (BIA 1998) (even where the exercise of due diligence is not a statutory requirement for reopening an in absentia deportation order, an alien’s lack of diligence may be a “factor that undercuts” the proffered explanation for the alien’s failure to appear at a scheduled immigration hearing).
 
The respondent’s motion sought reopening for the apparent purpose of applying for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. An alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order need not first rescind the order before seeking reopening of the proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013); see also section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). The exception does not apply to the respondent’s motion because the motion did not establish that his claims for asylum and withholding of removal are based on changed country conditions arising in Brazil since the date of his removal order in 2004. The respondent did not submit adequate evidence to establish the country conditions in Brazil in 2004 or 2017. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion did not establish changed country conditions in Brazil arising after the issuance of the in absentia order of removal on July 26, 2004 or that he filed his asylum application within a reasonable time period after such change (IJ at 3). Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
*3 We have considered the totality of the respondent’s claims regarding his motion and conclude that the respondent’s arguments on appeal do not establish that an exceptional situation exists which would warrant sua sponte reopening. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that sua sponte reopening is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter E. Torres, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cori White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Niger, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 20, 2017, which denied her motion to reopen removal proceedings. The parties have provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record shows that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personally served the respondent with a Notice to Appear on August 23, 2013 (Exh. 1). During these proceedings, the respondent was represented by counsel, S. Wayne Patterson. On February 6, 2014, the Immigration Judge granted a period of pre-conclusion voluntary departure until June 6, 2014, with an alternate order of removal.
 
On May 6, 2014, the respondent, through new counsel, Ann Marie Dooley, filed a motion to reopen to terminate her voluntary departure and secure a final order of removal. The Immigration Judge issued an order in response on May 9, 2014.
 
On June 2, 2017, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen in order to pursue an application for for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3) (2012), and protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). The motion alleged ineffective assistance from attorney Patterson. The Immigration Judge denied the motion in the June 20, 2017, decision on appeal.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. As the Immigration Judge stated, the motion is number-barred, and it is time-barred as well. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent has not shown or alleged changed country conditions in Niger to demonstrate that her motion should be excepted from the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Rather, she contends that the motion is not subject to the time and number limits, or should be granted sua sponte, because of ineffective assistance she received from attorney Patterson. The respondent asserts that the claimed ineffective assistance took two forms: (1) the filing of a deficient application for prosecutorial discretion; and (2) the failure to file an application for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab A at 2, Tab B at 9-10). Respondent’s Br. at 16-17. The respondent’s contentions are not persuasive.
 
*2 Prosecutorial discretion is a matter that is wholly within the jurisdiction of the DHS. Matter of W-Y-U-, 27 I&N Dec. 17, 19 (BIA 2017); Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 694 (BIA 2012). Thus, even if the application for prosecutorial discretion were deficient, the Board’s authority to protect a respondent’s due process rights does not extend beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991).
 
As for an asylum application, the application submitted with the motion is predicated on a fear of her husband’s family in Niger subjecting herself or her daughters to female genital mutilation (FGM) (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B at Exh. 16). However, the claim as is relates to the children is foreclosed by precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See Niang v. Gonzales, 492 F.3d 505 (4th Cir. 2007). Thus, any failure to pursue asylum on this basis is not prejudicial to the respondent. See Ilunga v. Holder, 777 F.3d 199, 208 (4th Cir. 2015) (establishing a due process violation requires a showing that the violation caused prejudice such that the result of the proceedings were likely impacted). As for the claim as it relates to the respondent herself, we do not find that the statements provided by the respondent establish that the terms of attorney Patterson’s representation of the respondent clearly included the filing of an asylum application (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B, Exh. 1 at 15, Exh. 9 at 4). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that this case does not present exceptional circumstances that warrant reopening sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The arguments on appeal in this regard, which rely in large part on the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, do not persuade us to conclude otherwise. Respondent’s Br. at 19-21. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MARK SEMANA GAVIOLA
File: AXXX XX8 351 - New York, NY
October 24, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Salvador E. Tuy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on November 8, 2012, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2010, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has now filed a motion with the Board to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order based on the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The respondent essentially contends that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by (a) advising the respondent not to attend the hearing on November 8, 2010, based on the anticipated grant of a continuance, and (b) not acknowledging this erroneous advice in subsequent filings (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2, 4, 6, Exh. A). The record before us does not contain a brief in opposition from the Department of Homeland Security. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion to reopen is both time and number barred. With certain exceptions not pertinent here, an alien is entitled to file one motion to reopen (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). This is the respondent’s second motion to reopen and he did not file this motion to reopen until March 30, 2017, well past the 90-day filing deadline.
 
The respondent initially argues that he filed his motion to reopen and rescind in a timely manner given the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, which qualifies as “exceptional circumstances.” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1, 7-10). We disagree. Even assuming the alleged ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former counsel qualifies as “exceptional circumstances” under the Act, the respondent’s motion to reopen is still untimely as it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia order issued by the Immigration Judge on November 8, 2010. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.2(c)(3), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent also has not submitted evidence demonstrating that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing on November 8, 2010, under sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) or (2); and we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s unsupported contention that the erroneous advice of his former counsel is equivalent to a lack of notice under the Act (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 9-10).
 
*2 We also conclude that the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen does not qualify for equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of former counsel. In order to warrant equitable tolling of the applicable time limitation based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien is required to demonstrate “due diligence” in pursuing his claim during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Celtic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006).
 
Here, the respondent has not meaningfully explained how he acted with due diligence prior to retaining current counsel and filing the instant motion to reopen on March 20, 2017. As set out above, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal on December 21, 2010, and the Board subsequently dismissed the appeal from this decision on November 8, 2012. The respondent alleges that he was unaware of his former counsel’s ineffective assistance until 2016, when his former counsel was disbarred and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board’s decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8-9, 11, 16, Exh. A at 2, Exhs. B, H). However, an alien is required to exercise due diligence during the entire period he seeks to equitably toll. Consequently, the respondent does not qualify for equitable tolling because he did not take steps to preserve his rights after the Immigration Judge’s adverse decision in 2010, or even after the Board’s adverse decision in 2012. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F3d at 133 (finding that due diligence required alien to follow up with his attorney after adverse decision); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, (2d Cir. 2000) (finding that alien did not exercise due diligence after adverse Board decision where he attempted to reach his attorney and then did nothing for 2 years).1
 
The respondent also requests that we sua sponte reopen the proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) so he may pursue an application for cancellation of removal. Based on the circumstances presented in this case, we do not find that the respondent has shown “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. A-N). See Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to sua sponte reopen proceedings is reserved for “exceptional situations” and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.”).2 To the extent the respondent is seeking reopening based on the potential hardship to his family (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 17), we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Aside from the lack of due diligence required for equitable tolling, the respondent has also not substantially complied with the procedural requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements . . . forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”). In particular, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with his former counsel or evidence that he informed his former counsel of the allegations against him and provided him with an opportunity to respond to the allegations. Even though the respondent allegedly attempted to contact his former attorney via phone (Motion to Reopen, Exh. A), the respondent has not explained why he did not attempt to inform his former counsel of the allegations via some other means, like traditional or electronic mail.

2

Although not dispositive to our decision, we reject the respondent’s contention that his grounds for removal no longer exist because his 1995 California conviction for assault with great bodily injury was set aside and dismissed in 2008 pursuant to section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code (Motion to Reopen at 16, Exh. I). Section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code is a rehabilitative statute that does not remove the immigration consequences of a conviction and sentence. See Matter of De Millan, 26 I&N Dec. 904, 908 (BIA 2017) (stating that section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code is a rehabilitative statute with a number of limitations on relief even under California law, including not affecting the existence of a conviction for the purpose of any subsequent criminal proceedings); Matter of Marroquin-Garcia, 23 I&N Dec. 705, 714-17 (A.G. 2005) (determining that the expungement or vacatur of a judgment pursuant to section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code, a rehabilitative statute, is still deemed a “conviction” for immigration purposes under the Act).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Michelle N. Mendez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; remand
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 12, 2017, when we denied the respondents’ motion to reconsider the Board’s August 17, 2016, decision, dismissing their appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 10, 2016, decision, denying their motion to reopen proceedings.1 On January 23, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the parties’ joint stipulated motion to remand the record to the Board. Therein, the parties sought remand for the Board to reconsider our prior decision “in light of [our]...jurisdiction to review decisions by Immigration Judges declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(3)... and in light of [the Fifth Circuit’s]...decision in Hernandez v. Lynch, 825 F.3d 266 (5th Cir. 2016)...”. On remand, the respondents’ filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further factual development of the record. For the reasons outlined below, the respondents’ appeal will be dismissed; and their motion to remand, denied.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
As part of the joint stipulation, the parties ask the Board to consider our jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(3), which grants us appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of Immigration Judges in removal proceedings, excluding certain determinations related to voluntary departure. Specifically, the joint stipulation asks us to examine this authority inasmuch as it relates to the Immigration Judge’s decision declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte. We direct the parties’ attention to our August 17, 2016, decision, wherein we recognized our authority to review the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte determination de novo, and we affirmed this portion of the decision (Board Order 1 at 3). Moreover, we reaffirmed this determination in our January 12, 2017, decision, denying the respondents’ motion to reconsider (Board Order 2 at 3).
 
The joint stipulation also requests that we reexamine our prior decision in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Hernandez v. Lynch, which held in relevant part that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to reconsider an order denying a motion to reopen where the Board failed to consider relevant evidence establishing that the respondent may not have received notice of the proceedings against him. See id. at 269-72. Unlike the respondent in Hernandez v. Lynch, however, notice of the respondents’ final hearing was properly served on their then counsel of record (Board Order 1 at 2). See Men Keng Chang v. Jiugni, 669 F.2d 275, 277-78 (5th Cir. 1982); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985).
 
*2 As the Fifth Circuit has consistently explained, where notice is provided to counsel and the respondents allege that counsel did not notify them of the date and time for such a hearing, this is not an issue involving deficient notice from the Immigration Court. See, e.g., Pawka v. Holder, 395 F. App’x 111 (5th Cir. 2010); Mendez-Santacruz v. Holder, 361 F. App’x 554 (5th Cir. 2010); Haryani v. Mukasey, 255 F. App’x 864, 866 (5th Cir. 2007). Instead, this is relevant to any ineffective assistance of counsel claim brought. See Pawka v. Holder, 395 F. App’x at 111; Mendez-Santacruz v. Holder, 361 F. App’x at 554; Haryani v. Mukasey, 255 F. App’x at 866. However, as we previously explained in our prior orders, the respondents here did not satisfy their burden to adequately make out an ineffective assistance claim (Board Order 1 at 2-3; Board Order 2 at 1-2).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondents seek remand of the record to provide further evidence regarding their ineffective assistance claim, we note that the motion only contains a generalized request but is unsupported by any evidence or specific proffer. Accordingly, we conclude that remand of the record for this purpose is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ motion to remand is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Joubin Nasseri, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of El Salvador, appeal the Immigration Judge’s March 21, 2017, decision denying their motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response. The record will be remanded.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the Immigration Judge erred in denying the respondents’ motion as number-barred, declining to further consider the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondents’ Br. at 5-6). While we agree that a respondent is generally limited to filing on motion to reopen during proceedings under section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, wherein this case arises, has recognized that the number limit may be equitably tolled in instances involving ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 588-92 (9th Cir. 2006) (tolling the numerical limitation where two attorneys failed to properly file motions to reopen, preventing the alien from reasonably presenting his case).
 
Given our limited fact-finding authority, we deem it necessary to remand for further consideration of the respondents’ motion, including their claim asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. We take no position on the merits of the respondent’s claim for equitable tolling. That is a matter for the Immigration Judge to decide in the first instance.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James E. Price, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Heather Libeu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On June 26, 2013, we concluded that the respondent had waived his right to appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 10, 2013, oral decision, and dismissed his appeal. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of prior counsel and to pursue adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 petition as the spouse of a United States citizen. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. For the reasons set out below, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. With certain exceptions not pertinent here, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent did not file his motion to reopen until March 20, 2017, almost 4 years past the 90-day filing deadline.
 
The respondent claims that his motion to reopen is timely because he filed it within 90 days of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s January 4, 2017, decision denying his petition for review (Motion to Reopen at 5). We disagree. As set out above, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. We have concluded that there is a distinction between judicial and administrative proceedings. See Matter of Susma, 22 I&N Dec. 947 (BIA 1999) (holding that a motion to reopen a decision of the Board following judicial review is untimely if it is filed more than 90 days after the date of the Board’s decision, even if the motion is filed within 90 days of the order of the court). In addition, the Ninth Circuit has concluded that a pending petition for review does not toll the statutory time limit for filing a motion to reopen with the Board. Dela Cruz v. Mukasey, 532 F.3d 946, 949 (9th Cir. 2008). Consequently, the motion to reopen was filed in an untimely manner.
 
The respondent seeks reopening based, in part, on ineffective assistance of counsel. Although not explicitly raised, we conclude that the time limits should not be equitably tolled based on the alleged ineffective assistance of prior counsel. Ineffective assistance of counsel may serve as a basis for equitable tolling. Bonilla v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 575, 582 (9th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). Equitable tolling of filing deadlines is appropriate where an alien is prevented from filing because of an attorney’s “deception, fraud, or error.” Bonilla, 840 F.3d at 582 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). However, equitable tolling requires that an alien act with “due diligence” in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
*2 In the case at bar, the respondent has not demonstrated that he exercised the requisite due diligence for equitable tolling. In assessing due diligence we consider (1) if and when a reasonable person would suspect the fraud or error; (2) whether the alien took reasonable steps to investigate the fraud or error or, alternatively, made reasonable efforts to pursue relief; and (3) when the alien learns of the harm from the ineffective assistance of counsel. Avagyan, 646 F.3d at 679. Here, the respondent has not shown that he was diligent in pursuing relief after learning of the alleged harm.
 
The respondent essentially claims that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel during the proceedings back in May 2013 by, inter alia, failing to inform the respondent of his potential eligibility for adjustment of status, and waiving his right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision (Motion to Reopen at 9-10). The respondent’s wife also filed a bar complaint against the respondent’s former counsel in July 2013 (Motion to Reopen at 4, Exh. D). However, the respondent has not meaningfully explained the steps he took to preserve his rights from 2013 to the filing of the instant motion to reopen in 2017. Consequently, we find that the respondent has not acted with due diligence in pursuing relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Bonilla, 840 F.3d at 583 (finding that alien did not make “reasonable efforts to pursue relief” when he waited 6 years to pursue relief after meeting with a pro bono attorney).
 
The respondent also requests that we sua sponte reopen the proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) so he may pursue adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 petition (Motion to Reopen at 10-11).1 Based on the circumstances presented in this case, we do not find that the respondent has shown “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. A-F). See Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to sua sponte reopen proceedings is reserved for “exceptional situations” and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.”). To the extent the respondent is seeking reopening based on the potential hardship to his family, we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

Although the respondent submitted evidence of an approved Form I-130 petition (Notice of Action, Form I-797)), this notice also indicates that the beneficiary (the respondent) is not eligible to file an adjustment of status application (Motion to Reopen, Exh. A). In any event, as set out in the decision, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and does not qualify for equitable tolling or sua sponte reopening.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack E. Wallace, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 29, 2017, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider this decision.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
Cast as a motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion fails to indicate any error in law or fact which would persuade this Board to reconsider our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). In his motion, the respondent argues that the Board erred in its assessment of his prior attorney’s admission of alienage, and argues that because his prior attorney made a mistake in admitting alienage, it cannot be considered tactical and the respondent’s resulting removal order is unjust. See Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820, 831-32 (9th Cir. 2011). However, we continue to note that the respondent does not allege that his admission of alienage is untrue or otherwise inaccurate, and we find no reason to disturb our previous finding that his assertion of prejudice, under Matter of Lozada, 18 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), is speculative in nature.
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted a letter from Thomas A. Kroeger, Counsel for the Florida Bar, indicating that “it cannot be said that (prior counsel’s) conduct demonstrated a lack of competence or diligence,” and noting that its standards differ from ineffective assistance of counsel claims in criminal or immigration proceedings. Cast as a timely motion to reopen proceedings, we do not find this letter material to these proceedings or likely to change the result of the respondent’s case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992). As such, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bhavya Chaudhary, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maribel Mercado
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 26, 2017, denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has also requested a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed, and the stay request will be denied as moot.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent has not established that reopening is warranted on account of lack of notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The record establishes that the Immigration Court properly mailed the Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the respondent’s March 22, 2012, removal hearing, to his then-attorney of record (NOH dated February 2, 2012). While the respondent’s counsel argues that Attorney Castillo was not the respondent’s attorney, statements by counsel are not evidence and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). The respondent’s counsel’s statements are not supported by a personal affidavit from the respondent indicating the same.
 
Moreover, a review of the record reflects that three attorneys from the same law firm, including Attorney Castillo, submitted Notices of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Forms EOIR-28), on behalf of the respondent in the proceedings below. Notice sent to an alien’s attorney of record is considered constructive notice to the alien. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c), 1292.5; Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 258 (BIA 1985).
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance by his former attorney, such claim is untimely as it was not presented within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order, and he has not demonstrated due diligence in pursuing such claim. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Further, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent seeks sua sponte reopening of these proceedings, he has not demonstrated that an exceptional situation exists. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We recognize that the respondent has pending applications before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). However, a final order of removal does not preclude the respondent from pursuing those applications with the USCIS. The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS pending the adjudication of his applications for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a); see also 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv) (amending the rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers to permit individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers in certain instances).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s stay request is denied as moot.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aaron Tarin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey D. Clark
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 22, 2017, order denying his Motion to Reopen Sua Sponte and Terminate Removal Proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgement, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues that this case should be remanded because the Immigration Judge did not articulate his reasoning for denying the respondent’s motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 9-10). The Immigration Judge’s order denying the respondent’s motion indicates he agrees with the arguments in the opposition motion. We agree with the respondent that such an order would in some cases necessitate remand. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786, 787-88 (BIA 1994). However, for the reasons articulated below, we conclude that the Immigration Judge does not have jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion, and thus remand is unnecessary. We point out that this was among the arguments raised in the DHS’s opposition to the motion.
 
The basic facts of this case are not in dispute. The respondent, a lawful permanent resident, pled guilty to and was convicted of aggravated battery. Based on that conviction, the DHS issued a Notice to Appear, charging the respondent with removability under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1228(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 1228(a)(2)(E)(i), for having been convicted of an aggravated felony and a crime of domestic violence (Exh. 1). The respondent was ordered removed by the Immigration Judge on October 25, 2015, and he waived appeal. He was subsequently removed from the United States. On August 16, 2016, the respondent’s conviction for aggravated battery was vacated after the respondent obtained post-conviction relief due to ineffective assistance of counsel, as he was not properly advised of the immigration consequences of his plea (DHS’s Br. at 4; Respondent’s Br. at 1-2; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen Sua Sponte and Terminate, Tab C). He filed a motion to reopen and terminate his removal proceedings on March 16, 2017, which the Immigration Judge denied.
 
*2 The respondent admits that his motion to reopen is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the entry of a final administrative order of removal (Respondent’s Br. at 4). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). He does not allege that any applicable statutory or regulatory exception exists. He therefore relies on the Immigration Judge’s authority to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
We agree with the DHS that the respondent’s removal from the United States following the issuance of a final order of removal barred consideration of his motion by the Immigration Judge (DHS’s Br. at 5-7). The so-called departure bar regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(d) divest the Immigration Judges and the Board of jurisdiction to consider motions to reopen in the case of aliens who are subject to removal orders and have departed the United States. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit’s decision in Contreras-Bocanegra v. Holder, 678 F.3d 811 (10th Cir. 2012), concluded that the departure bar regulations conflicted with the statute governing motions to reopen, and thus were invalid with respect to motions to reopen that complied with the statutory requirements. Contreras-Bocanegra v. Holder, 678 F.3d at 815-18; compare section 240(c)(7) of the Act with 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d), 1003.23(b)(1). The alien in that case had filed a timely motion to reopen. Contreras-Bocanegra v. Holder, 678 F.3d at 813. Although the court overruled its prior holding in Rosillo-Puga v. Holder, 580 F.3d 1147 (10th Cir. 2009), which involved an untimely motion, it specifically noted that this was necessary because the holding in Rosillo-Puga had not been limited to untimely motions. See Contreras-Bocanegra v. Holder, 678 F.3d at 815 n.3. However, the court did not indicate whether the Contreras-Bocanegra holding reaches the scenario present in Rosillo-Puga.
 
Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed outside the 90-day statutory requirement, Contreras-Bocanegra does not govern this case. Absent controlling case law to the contrary, the Board is bound by the regulations. See Matter of Fede, 20 I&N Dec. 35, 36 (BIA 1989).1 Therefore, we conclude that the Immigration Judge does not have jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). To the extent that the respondent requests that the Board exercises its authority to grant his motion, we likewise lack jurisdiction. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). As such, we need not address the parties’ additional arguments regarding this motion. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wael M. Ahmad, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lynn Hollander
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s January 30, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on March 26, 2013, after she did not appear for a scheduled hearing. She filed her motion to reopen on January 23, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security has submitted a brief in opposition to the respondent’s appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that the failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(e)(1); or (2) at any time where the alien establishes that she did not have proper notice of the hearing at which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen because the record does not support the respondent’s argument that she did not receive proper notice of her hearing. The hearing notice was served on the respondent’s attorney of record, who was present at the March 26, 2013, hearing. Service on the respondent’s attorney of record constitutes proper service of a hearing notice. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). The respondent asserts in her motion to reopen that her attorney failed to apprise her of the hearing at which she was ordered removed. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2, 4. However, the respondent’s attorney stated at the March 26, 2013, hearing that he had attempted to contact the respondent and had been unable to contact her (IJ at 1). Further, to the extent that the respondent asserts that she did not receive notice of the hearing because of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing such a claim. See Lin Xing Jiang v. Holder, 639 F.3d 751, 753 (7th Cir. 2011) (approving of the Matter of Lozada requirements). While the respondent states on appeal that she intends to demonstrate compliance with some of the Lozada requirements,1 no additional evidence has been submitted. We conclude that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened due to improper notice.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that submitting a bar complaint, as the respondent suggests she intends to do, is not sufficient by itself to satisfy the Lozada requirement that the accused attorney be given a timely opportunity to respond. Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 369 (7th Cir. 2012).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tiana P. Garner, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Sierra Leone, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 4, 2017, denying his request for a continuance and ordering his removal from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed an appellate brief or statement. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent does not contest on appeal the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is subject to removal from the United States under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2017), as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(G) and (R) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(G) and (R) (IJ at 2; Exh. 1). The respondent also does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is not eligible at this time for any form of relief available in these proceedings. (IJ at 2). Those issues are not before us.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s speculative pursuit of post-conviction relief in the state jurisdiction where he was convicted of removable criminal offenses did not amount to good cause warranting a further continuance of proceedings (IJ at 2). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. On the date of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent did not assert that he had even begun the process of applying for post-conviction relief (Tr. at 6-8). In the respondent’s appellate brief, while he does state that his convictions are “in the process of being re-opened,” he does not specifically claim to have filed any specific motion for post-conviction relief with any court. See Respondent’s Br. at 2. In any event, even if the respondent had filed a proper motion in state court seeking relief from the conviction, the respondent’s conviction would remain final for immigration purposes. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). While we acknowledge that the respondent may intend to seek, or continue to seek collateral relief, his arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board that his quest for collateral relief is more than speculative.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent makes a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel in immigration proceedings. We note that the respondent has not shown that he was substantially prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his request for a continuance in order to further challenge his criminal convictions. See Cole v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 712 F.3d 517, 534-35 (11th Cir. 2013); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983). Since the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent has not presented any evidence that his convictions were vacated or that he has filed for post-conviction relief.1 For that reason, and because the collateral challenge remains speculative, the respondent’s assertion that former counsel failed to adequately present a case for a continuance is not a basis for a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. As this Board noted in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), a showing of some level of prejudice is a requirement for a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Id. at 638. Finally, the respondent has not articulated on appeal any form of relief for which he is eligible, and therefore his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be based on an assertion that former counsel improperly failed to apply for relief.2
 
If the respondent believes that he should be permitted to remain in the United States while he further challenges his criminal convictions, he is not precluded from pursuing immigration benefits, such as a stay of removal, directly from the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6. However, as we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to order his removal from the United States, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Statements of counsel made on appeal are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505-06 (BIA 1980). Furthermore, the copy of the plea colloquy in the respondent’s criminal case that has been submitted in conjunction with this appeal is not, without more, evidence of an ongoing collateral challenge to the convictions.

The respondent’s appellate argument that this appeal should be sustained based on the ineffective assistance of counsel in the respondent’s criminal proceedings is unavailing. The proper forum for that claim is with the state court having jurisdiction over the respondent’s claim.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion, which has not been opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is denied. This case was last before the Board on March 21, 2017, when the Board denied the respondent’s untimely filed motion to reopen. The Board concluded that the respondent did not demonstrate that he exercised due diligence during his more than 17-year delay in raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel nor shown that reopening is warranted in the exercise of discretion. The respondent now timely requests reconsideration of that Board decision. However, the respondent’s motion sets forth no adequate basis for reconsideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). The respondent’s motion does not identify any prior argument presented that was overlooked by the Board nor does it identify any error of law or fact in the Board’s March 21, 2017, decision. We separately note that the respondent has yet to offer a coherent and persuasive explanation for his extremely lengthy delay in raising a claim against former counsel.
 
We do not find the respondent’s asserted disagreement with the outcome of the Board’s March 21, 2017, decision sufficient to demonstrate either that the Board improperly evaluated or disregarded the facts and evidence presented or committed legal error. The motion to reconsider is therefore denied.1

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dalia R. Kejbou, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason Ritter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Iraq, appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 21, 2016, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error, including findings as to the credibility of testimony. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States on June 18, 1970, as a lawful permanent resident (IJ at 1; Exh. 1). On February 5, 1991, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy for the “Unlawful manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver . . .” cocaine in the amount of 650 grams or more, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws. § 333.7401(2)(a)(1), and was sentenced to life in prison without parole (IJ at 1-2). See February 5, 1991, Judgment.1 The respondent was released from custody after serving 19 years in prison (IJ at 2). The respondent was placed in removal proceedings and charged with being removable based on his conviction for an aggravated felony and a controlled substance violation. See sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act; see also Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184 (2013). On May 1, 2009, the respondent signed a Stipulated Request for Removal Order and Waiver of Hearing in which he said that he had no fear of returning to Iraq (IJ at 2). See Stipulated Removal Request at 2; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(b). The Department of Homeland Security concurred in the respondent’s request for a stipulated removal order.
 
In the Biographic Information form that the respondent completed, however, he indicated that he was afraid “of being harmed and persecuted if returned to Iraq” (IJ at 2). See May 6, 2009, Biographic Information at 2. Because of the inconsistency in the respondent’s statements about his fear of returning to Iraq, the Immigration Judge denied the joint request for a stipulated order of removal and scheduled a master calendar hearing (IJ at 2). See Immigration Judge’s May 14, 2009, Order.
 
At the respondent’s May 18, 2009, hearing, the Immigration Judge informed the respondent that, because of his conviction, he was only eligible to apply for relief under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3; Tr. at 2-3). The respondent said that he understood (IJ at 3; Tr. at 3, 4). The respondent declined the Immigration Judge’s offer to reschedule the hearing so that the respondent could speak to his family and potentially obtain counsel (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4). The respondent indicated that he had been in jail for 19 years because of his criminal conviction and that he continued to be detained on an “““immigration hold” (Tr. at 2). The respondent stated that, although he had a fear of returning to Iraq, he did not want to seek relief from removal because he did not want to be detained any longer (Tr. at 1-2, 3-4). The respondent said that he did not “want to get deported, but like I told you, I just want to get out of jail. And if that’s what it takes, to deport me, then that’s your decision, sir.” (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4). The respondent indicated that he understood that he was waiving his right to apply for relief and that he would be ordered removed (Tr. at 4-5). After questioning the respondent about whether he understood his rights, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for the entry of a removal order and the respondent waived his right to appeal (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4-5).
 
*2 Seven years later, on October 7, 2016, the respondent filed a Motion to Reopen his removal proceedings. In the motion, the respondent argued that his stipulated removal request was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The respondent asked that his proceedings be reopened so that he could apply for withholding of removal and relief under section 212(c) of the Act. On November 21, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent now appeals that decision.
 
“A motion to reopen [or remand] proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In addition, to obtain reopening, the respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is statutorily eligible for the relief sought and that he warrants relief in the exercise of discretion. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 106 (1988). Prima facie eligibility is shown where the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied and that there is a reasonable likelihood that relief will be granted in the exercise of discretion. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his “consent to the joint stipulated request was not knowing, voluntary, considered and intelligent.” See Respondent’s Brief at 1. Contrary to the respondent’s argument, however, the Immigration Judge did not accept the parties’ stipulated removal order. See Immigration Judge’s May 14, 2009, Order. Because the respondent indicated in the Biographic Information that he feared persecution in Iraq, the Immigration Judge held a master calendar hearing and informed the respondent of his rights including to have a hearing and to seek counsel (IJ at 2; Tr. at 1, 2). The Immigration Judge informed the respondent that, because of his conviction, he was only eligible to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3; Tr. at 2-3). As noted above, the respondent indicated that he had been in jail for 19 years because of his criminal conviction and that he continued to be detained on an “immigration hold” (Tr. at 2). The respondent stated that he did not want to seek relief from removal because he did not want to be detained any longer. The respondent said that he did not “want to get deported, but like I told you, I just want to get out of jail. And if that’s what it takes, to deport me, then that’s your decision, sir.” (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4). The respondent also said that he understood that he was waiving his right to apply for relief and that he would be ordered removed. After questioning the respondent about whether he understood his rights, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for the entry of a removal order (Tr. at 5). Therefore, contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, the Immigration Judge did not order the respondent removed pursuant to the stipulated removal order.2
 
*3 In any event, even if the respondent’s waiver was not knowing and voluntary, the respondent sought reopening in order to apply for withholding of removal and relief under section 212(c) of the Act. Motion to Reopen at 3, 5. Nonetheless, he did not present sufficient evidence to show that he was prima facie eligible for such relief. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323; see also Mapouya v. Gonzales, 487 F.3d 396, 415-16 (6th Cir. 2007) (due process claim cannot succeed without a showing that the alleged error materially affected the outcome of his case). As the Immigration Judge found, because the respondent’s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver 650 grams or more of cocaine constitutes a particularly serious crime, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal (IJ at 12). See section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Y-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 274 (A.G. 2002) (convictions for drug trafficking crimes are presumptively convictions for particularly serious crimes under the Act unless the respondent demonstrates “the most extenuating circumstances that are both extraordinary and compelling”); Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336, 343 (BIA 2007).3
 
Further, the respondent does not meaningfully challenge on appeal the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is ineligible for section 212(c) relief because the respondent served 19 years in prison for his aggravated felony conviction (IJ at 11). Matter of Abdelghany, 26 I&N Dec. 254, 272 (BIA 2014) (alien is ineligible for relief under section 212(c) if, inter alia, he has served an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least 5 years as a result of one or more aggravated felony convictions entered between November 29, 1990, and April 24, 1996); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(f)(4)(i); Respondent’s Brief at 1-2.
 
In addition, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured in Iraq by or with the acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (IJ at 12-13; Tr. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c) and 1208.18(a). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the government of Iraq would acquiesce in the respondent’s torture and the respondent has identified no clear error in that finding (IJ at 12).
 
In sum, given the evidence presented, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323 (to obtain reopening, the respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is statutorily eligible for the relief sought and that he warrants relief in the exercise of discretion).
 
*4 Further, while this appeal was pending, the respondent filed a second Motion to Reopen and for Stay of Removal. Under section 207(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, with limited exceptions, the respondent may file one motion to reopen and it must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The respondent’s second motion was filed more than 8 years after he was ordered removed, however. Nonetheless, the time and numerical limitations do not apply if the respondent seeks to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions arising in his country of nationality and submits material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4); see also Matter of C-W-L-, 24 I&N Dec. 346, 349 (BIA 2007).
 
In this case, to demonstrate changed country conditions in Iraq, the respondent relies on news articles indicating that former Secretary of State John Kerry stated in 2014 that actions by ISIS in Iraq constitute genocide against certain minority groups including Christians. See Second Motion to Reopen at 6. Based on these statements, the respondent argues that conditions in Iraq have changed for Christians and, therefore, that he warrants an exception to the time and numerical limitations on the filing of a motion to reopen.
 
Despite this argument, however, the respondent also relied on these news articles when he filed his first Motion to Reopen on October 7, 2016. See First Motion to Reopen at 5. In that motion, the respondent stated that, on March 17, 2016, the “United States government declared that ISIS’s current actions against Christians in Iraq rise to the level of genocide. John Kerry, Sec’y of State.” First Motion to Reopen at 5. The respondent’s second motion to reopen also argues that, based on Secretary Kerry’s statement, the respondent’s removal proceedings should be reopened.
 
Similarly, although the respondent argues that a federal district court judge recently granted a preliminary injunction against the removal of Iraqi nationals from the United States, the respondent’s argument that he fears persecution in Iraq because he is a Christian is substantively the same argument that he made in his first Motion to Reopen. See Second Motion to Reopen at 7, Exh. F.
 
Given the evidence presented, the respondent has not presented material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See Bi Feng Liu v. Holder, 560 F.3d 485, 491 (6th Cir. 2009). For these reasons, we conclude that the respondent has not shown that he qualifies for an exception to the time and numerical limits on the filing of a motion to reopen in order to apply for asylum or withholding of removal.
 
*5 To the extent that the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened because his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance, the respondent did not comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). To succeed on a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent should submit an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts including the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken on appeal. Also, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed respond. Finally, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. The respondent must also show that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863-64 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
In this case, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts including the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken on appeal, and has not indicated whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. The respondent also has not shown that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, because the respondent did not comply with the requirements for filing a motion to reopen to allege ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent requests a stay of removal pending his appeal, because we dismiss the respondent’s appeal, the request for a stay of removal is moot. To the extent that the respondent argues that his removal should be stayed so that he can apply for relief from removal, the respondent’s request will be construed as a request for reopening and is denied as explained above. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

At the time of the respondent’s conviction, the statute under which the respondent was convicted provided: “Sec. 7401. (1) Except as authorized by this article, a person shall not manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance . . . . (2) A person who violates this section as to: (a) A controlled substance classified in schedule 1 or 2 which is either a narcotic drug or described in section 7214(a)(iv) and: (i) Which is in an amount of 650 grams or more of any mixture containing that controlled substance is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned for life.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 333.7401.

2

The respondent argues that he would have “done anything to get out of custody after serving more than 19 years in prison.” See Respondent’s Brief at 1. This does not demonstrate, however, that the respondent’s acceptance of a removal order was not knowing and voluntary. See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742 (1970). In fact, the respondent concedes that the Immigration Judge advised the respondent of his rights and that “it appears from the record that Respondent may have understood the Immigration Judge[’s] questions.” See Respondent’s Brief at 1.

3

The respondent has not challenged the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is removable as charged or that his conviction constitutes a particularly serious crime (Tr. at 3-4). See Respondent’s Brief at 1-2.

Cori White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 At a hearing held on February 14, 2017, the respondent did not apply for any form of relief and the Immigration Judge ordered her removal to El Salvador. The respondent timely filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, asserting that her prior counsel should have pursued an application for asylum and a petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status on her behalf. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on April 7, 2017; the respondent’s appeal from that decision will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen, for the reasons set forth in his decision. Even assuming that the respondent complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), she did not establish that her former counsel’s representation was ineffective. The respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief she contends her former counsel should have sought. The respondent asserts that she entered as an unaccompanied minor and her former counsel should have filed a petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status (Form I-360) on her behalf. However, the record reflects that the respondent entered the United States at age 19; thus, she did not qualify as an unaccompanied minor, and has not demonstrated that she could have obtained SIJ status.
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. She does not indicate in her motion or on her asylum application1 that she has suffered persecution or fears future persecution on account of an enumerated ground contained in the Act. See Matter of S-P-, 21 I&N Dec. 486 (BIA 1996); sections 208(b)(1)(B)(i) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i), 1231(b)(3)(A). A generalized fear of gang violence does not support a claim for asylum. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 235 (BIA 2014) (“asylum and refugee laws do not protect people from general conditions of strife, such as crime and other societal afflictions”); see also Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159, 164 (4th Cir. 2009). In light of the foregoing, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance on the part of her former attorney. Thus, she did not demonstrate that reopening is warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaspreet Singh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jo Ann McLane
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 31, 2017, denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on December 8, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), filed a motion for summary affirmance and argued in opposition to the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed (i) within 180 days after the date of the removal order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (ii) at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
In this case, the respondent was properly served a Notice to Appear in person on February 7, 2011, while he was in DHS custody at the Willacy Detention Center. While the respondent was detained, an attorney filed a Notice of Entry of Attorney or Representative, Form EOIR-28, on February 11, 2011. The Form EOIR-28 provided the address for the respondent’s attorney of record. On March 8, 2011, the Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing to the address provided by the respondent’s attorney of record (EOIR-28, dated February 11, 2011). The notice of hearing informed the respondent that a hearing was scheduled for December 8, 2011. The notice of hearing was not returned to the Immigration Court as undeliverable.
 
The respondent failed to appear and he was ordered removed in absentia December 8, 2011. If an alien fails to provide an address pursuant to section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act, then “no notice shall be required.” Section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 359-60 (5th Cir. 2009) (court found that alien did not receive notice of his hearing because he failed to comply with his obligation to provide the Immigration Court with current address information).
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent is properly charged with receipt of the February 11, 2011, notice of the hearing, which scheduled a hearing for December 8, 2011 (IJ at 2). In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that he filed an Alien Change of Address form, EOIR-33, dated March 8, 2011, and did not receive notice of his hearing held on December 8, 2011 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-5). Assuming that the change of address form was filed on March 8, 2011, we note that the change of address was filed after the February 11, 2011, notice of hearing was sent to the attorney of record. Service of the notice of hearing to the attorney of record constitutes adequate notice of the hearing scheduled for December 8, 2011. C.F.R. §§ 1003.13 (defining “Service”), 1295.5(a) (stating that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be required to be served upon the attorney or representative or the person if himself if not represented). Moreover, we conclude that the respondent’s motion did not succeed in rebutting the presumption of delivery of the hearing notice in his case. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674 (BIA 2008). Therefore, the respondent received proper notice of the scheduled hearing.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen filed on May 1, 2017, included an application for asylum (Motion Reopen at 10-20). With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on December 8, 2011. Thus, the motion to reopen was untimely by several years. However, the time limits for motions to reopen do not apply if the basis of the motion is to apply or reapply for asylum and for withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
In this case, the exception did not apply to the respondent’s motion, for it did not establish changed country conditions in India arising after the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s decision on December 8, 2011 (IJ at 2). Gotora v. Holder, 567 Fed.Appx. 219 (5th Cir. 2014) (“In determining whether evidence accompanying a motion to reopen demonstrates a material change in country conditions, the BIA ‘compare[s] the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to those that existed at the time of the merits hearing below.”DD’). The respondent’s motion to reopen included an application for asylum and for withholding of removal but did not present any evidence or arguments to establish that “changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality,” occurring after his hearing in December 2011 show that material changed circumstances or country conditions in India (IJ at 2). Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 252 (BIA 2007), aff’d., Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 171 (2d Cir. 2008). Therefore, the respondent’s motion for reopening for the purpose of applying for asylum and for withholding of removal was properly denied.
 
*3 The respondent claims that his prior counsel did not inform him of the hearing in 2011. However, the respondent has not demonstrated a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant motion. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board). The respondent has not complied with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding that “the general application of the Lozada rules is not an abuse of discretion.”); Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gautam J. Jagannath, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ricardo Cuellar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; change of venue
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 20, 2000, when we entered a final administrative order dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his prior motion to reopen. On April 26, 2017, the respondent submitted the instant motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion exceeds both the time and number limitations for motions to reopen, and it will be denied. The respondent’s request for a change of venue will also be denied.
 
An alien may file only one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i). In certain circumstances, an alien may toll the time limit applicable to his motion to reopen by demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition to complying with the procedural requirements for such a claim, the alien must show prejudice as a result of the ineffective assistance and that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to toll. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of El Salvador. On February 4, 1999, he failed to appear for his removal hearing and he was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. On March 30, 1999, he sought to have his proceedings reopened based on a claim that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing. He now seeks reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent relates that he asked the advice of his mother’s attorney, who advised him not to attend his hearing because it was likely that he would be deported. See Motion, ¶ 6; Exhibit 3, ¶¶ 11, 15, 38. He states that the attorney advised him that despite a deportation order, he would be protected by his Temporary Protected Status (TPS). See Motion, ¶ 7; Exhibit 3, ¶ 18. The respondent claims that he did not become aware until 2006 that he had been ordered in 1999 to be removed, and did not understand how serious it was until 2016. See Motion, ¶ 8; Exhibit 3, ¶ 20. The respondent declares that he was unaware that a motion on his behalf had been filed in 1999, and that he found out in 2016, that the attorney who had previously advised him had filed a motion, a declaration, and an appeal on his behalf, but did not timely submit an appeal brief which resulted in the dismissal of the appeal. See Motion, ¶¶ 9-10, 12; Exhibit 3, ¶¶ 21-24. The respondent states that in 2001, he employed that attorney to help him in applying for TPS status on his own, and in 2003, employed him to help him apply for lawful permanent resident status. See Motion, ¶ 11; Exhibit 3, ¶¶ 25-30. He claims that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Motion, ¶ 16; § III.
 
*2 The respondent also seeks reopening based on claims that his prior application for asylum was withdrawn without his apparent consent, that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on an approved visa petition filed on his behalf by his lawful permanent resident mother, that he is eligible for asylum based on past persecution that he suffered in El Salvador and a fear of persecution there as a member of two particular social groups, as a member of his mother’s family and as a person with tattoos, and that he is eligible for a nonimmigrant U visa petition as a victim of a crime in the United States. See Motion, § IV. However, these claims are not mentioned in the respondent’s affidavit, and statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
The respondent offers his affidavit, his prior motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge’s order denying his motion, the appeal briefing schedule, an extension request grant, our prior order dismissing his appeal, an approval notice for his application for employment authorization, an approval notice for a visa petition submitted on his behalf by his lawful permanent resident mother, a notice of administrative termination of an asylum application in his name but with a different alien registration number, his new application for asylum, an incident report from the Oakland Police Department, a letter to the attorney regarding his allegations of ineffective assistance, his complaint against him filed with the Executive Office of Immigration Review, and his current counsel’s declaration.
 
The respondent admits that he was aware of his hearing scheduled for February 4, 1999, and that he decided not to appear because he was advised by an attorney that he may be deported if he were to appear. We find that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s claim at this time that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because an attorney filed a motion to reopen, a declaration, and an appeal on his behalf in 1999 without his knowledge, and that he did not authorize that attorney to represent him or take such actions. The record reflects that on March 31, 1999, the respondent through counsel submitted a motion to reopen accompanied by a Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, signed by the respondent for representation before the Immigration Judge. The record further reflects that on July 9, 1999, the respondent through counsel submitted an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen accompanied by a Form EOIR-27, Notice of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, signed by the respondent for representation before this Board. We are not convinced that the respondent had not authorized the attorney to act on his behalf or to take those actions.
 
*3 We will deny the respondent’s motion because he has not established that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel and that he exercised due diligence in raising his claim against his former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 637; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 561; also Rodriguez-Manzano, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012); Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (upholding the Lozada requirements). The respondent states that he became aware in 2006 that he had been ordered to be removed based on his failure to appear for his hearing. We find that his claim that he did not understand the seriousness of the situation until 2016 is inadequate to explain his failure to seek reopening or to investigate the actions taken in his case, particularly in light of his history of employing the same attorney between 2001 and 2003. We conclude that equitable tolling of the time limit for a motion to reopen is not warranted in this case.
 
The burden of proof on a motion to reopen is on the alien to establish eligibility for the requested relief. See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir. 2006); Zhang v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir. 2005). The evidence that the respondent offers is not sufficient to support his claim that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status, asylum, and a nonimmigrant U visa petition to warrant reopening his removal proceedings. His motion is not supported by applications for such relief other than an application for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen must be accompanied by an appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation). Moreover, the respondent’s motion has not been timely filed, and a claim of eligibility for adjustment of status is generally not a circumstance warranting the grant of an untimely motion to reopen. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
The respondent’s motion does not satisfy any of the exceptions to the time limit imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings, and does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). We conclude that the respondent has not satisfied his heavy burden of proving that his removal proceedings should be reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, as the motion exceeds both the time and number limits for motions to reopen, it will be denied. The respondent’s request for a change of venue will also be denied.
 
*4 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and request for a change of venue are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rene Siqueiros, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated February 3, 2017, denying the respondent’s request for a further continuance and granting him voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Initially, we note that the respondent has not submitted a brief in support of his appeal, despite indicating that he would submit a brief and despite requesting and being granted an extension for submission of a brief. Thus, we will consider only the limited statements presented in the respondent’s Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance. The decision to grant a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge continued these proceedings four times between April 2002 and February 2017, to provide the respondent opportunities to seek legal representation and for case preparation. At the February 3, 2017, hearing, the respondent appeared with prior counsel; however, he did not identify any relief from removal that he wished to pursue. Rather, the respondent’s prior counsel made a motion to withdraw from the respondent’s case, and further moved to substitute a different attorney to represent the respondent. The Immigration Judge denied those motions.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel by his prior attorney, and that such ineffective assistance prevented him from pursuing relief available to him. However, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) so as to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Nor has the respondent articulated on appeal any relief for which he may be eligible. Although the respondent asserted that he “may” be eligible for asylum because he was a police officer in Mexico, he has not submitted an application for asylum on appeal, or otherwise set forth a persecution claim. Accordingly, he has not established that any deficient assistance by prior counsel caused him any prejudice. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2000) (requiring a showing of prejudice to establish a violation of due process). Nor has he established that continued proceedings were warranted. The following orders will therefore be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander C. Vrbanoff, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Geoffrey P. Gilpin
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on April 18, 2012, at which time we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s March 17, 2011, denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia proceedings. The respondent has now filed, on July 31, 2017, an untimely motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he received from the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Court and this Board. Specifically, the respondent argues that his attorney failed to properly request information from him about his mental state, and that as a result, he did not have an opportunity to present the true reasons for his absence from his February 16, 2011, hearing during his previous motion. In support of his current claim, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, medical records and a March 26, 2017, psychological assessment, as well as an affidavit, letters of support, and evidence indicating that he filed a complaint with the Illinois bar in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Notwithstanding the respondent’s complaint with the Supreme Court of Illinois, Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission, he has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel. The Illinois Disciplinary Commission concluded that they would be “““unable to establish by the requisite standard of evidence that (prior counsel) neglected your legal matter or that he otherwise engaged in professional misconduct.” Moreover, we note that the respondent’s letter to prior counsel, dated May 1, 2017, claims that in preparation for his initial 2011 motion to reopen, “the only questions you asked me were about why I had failed to appear at the hearing.” Under the circumstances, we do not find that the respondent has carried his burden of demonstrating that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel. Id.
 
Moreover, as the DHS argues in its response brief, the respondent has not brought this motion with due diligence. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859-60 (7th Cir. 2012). The respondent does not assert that he was unaware of the denial of his 2011 motion to reopen proceedings, and he has not demonstrated that he could not reasonably have filed this motion within the last 5 years. Id; see also Patel v. Gonzalez, 442 F.3d 1011 (7th Cir. 2006).
 
*2 Accordingly, we find no merit to the respondent’s motion, and no reason to except the respondent’s motion from the timeliness requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be, accordingly, denied as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Chu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Roslyn Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand; reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native of the United Arab Emirates and a citizen of India, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 20, 2016, ordering the respondent removed from the United States.1 The respondent has also filed a motion to remand.2 The Department of Homeland (DHS) opposes the appeal and the motion. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was placed in removal proceedings pursuant to a Notice to Appear (NTA) filed with the Immigration Court on April 21, 2014 (Exh. 1). At a hearing on May 14, 2015, the respondent, through counsel, admitted the first three allegations in the NTA but denied that he entered into a marriage with a United States citizen for the sole purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit (Tr. at 2). At that time, the respondent also denied the charge of removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) (Tr. at 2-3). On May 27, 2016, the DHS filed a Form I-261, Additional Charges of Removability, charging the respondent under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act (Exh. 3).
 
At a hearing on June 20, 2016, the respondent admitted the previously denied allegation, admitted the allegations contained in the Form I-261, and conceded both charges of removability (Tr. at 8-11). The respondent’s counsel requested a continuance to prepare an application for cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent residents under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (Tr. at 13-14). The DHS opposed the respondent’s request, arguing that the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal by virtue of having departed the United States for an aggregate period of more than 180 days (Tr. at 17-18). The DHS separately argued that the respondent was precluded from establishing that he has been a person of good moral character by virtue of his admissions and concessions (Tr. at 18). The respondent’s counsel indicated that the respondent was not seeking any other form of relief (Tr. at 24-25). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States pursuant to the charges.
 
*2 As an initial matter, we recognize that the DHS, in its appeal brief, requested reconsideration of the Board’s February 2, 2017, decision exercising jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal (DHS Br. at 3-4). However, this request is contained within the DHS’s appeal brief and is not a properly filed motion to reconsider. In any event, we would deny the motion as untimely as it was not filed within 30 days of our February 2, 2017, decision and the DHS has not adequately explained the delay in filing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).
 
The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel and seeks a remand pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He argues, inter alia, that his former counsel’s decision to concede the charges of removability constituted ineffective assistance. To support a claim for ineffective assistance, an alien must (1) provide an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, including a statement of the terms of the attorney-client agreement; (2) inform prior counsel of the allegations and allow prior counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) file or explain why a grievance has not been filed with the disciplinary authorities against the offending attorney. Id. In addition to these requirements, an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada. The evidence offered in support of his motion includes an affidavit from the respondent, a copy of a letter sent to former counsel informing him of the allegations, and a copy of the grievance form that was filed with the State Bar of Texas.
 
Upon consideration of the evidence, we conclude that the respondent has established that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s ineffective assistance. In general, an alien will be bound by formal admissions and concessions made by counsel acting in his professional capacity. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (holding that the concession of deportability was a reasonable tactical decision by counsel). However, a concession by counsel may constitute ineffective assistance where there is no plausible explanation for how the strategy resulted in a possible tactical advantage. See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 166 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding ineffective assistance where counsel conceded a false claim of citizenship charge, thereby cutting off all available avenues of relief, without any apparent benefit to the alien). We cannot agree with the DHS’s argument that respondent’s former counsel made a tactical decision to concede the charges to prevent the DHS from presenting witness testimony that would have negatively impacted the outcome of any discretionary form of relief, particularly where the respondent’s former counsel only requested one form of relief, which was unavailable to the respondent for other reasons (DHS Br. at 19).
 
*3 In light of the foregoing, we will grant the respondent’s motion to remand for a hearing on the charges of removability and any other proceedings the Immigration Judge deems appropriate.3 Because the record will be remanded, we do not address the respondent’s remaining arguments. In remanding, we express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996). The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings and the issuance of a new decision.

The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on July 18, 2016, which was pending at the time he filed this appeal on July 20, 2016. The motion to reopen will be deemed a motion to remand and will be considered in conjunction with the respondent’s appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4).

3

The respondent does not argue that he would be eligible for any form of relief if both charges of removability are sustained.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew Taylor, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s February 22, 2017, decision denying his request for a further continuance and ordering his removal from the United States. The Immigration Judge declined to continue the respondent’s case so that he could pursue an application for derivative nonimmigrant U-visa relief with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance in order to file a Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant (Form I-929). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. In the instant case, the Immigration Judge continued the case twice over the course of one year to provide the respondent with an opportunity to file the Form I-929. At the time of the respondent’s last hearing, however, he did not present evidence of a pending petition; nor did he demonstrate his prima facie eligibility for a derivative nonimmigrant U-visa. See generally Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012). On appeal, the respondent’s counsel asserts that he suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder, and that this affects his ability to “timely file.” He asserts that the Immigration Judge was aware of this condition. However, regardless of this appellate assertion, the respondent has not, either before the Immigration Judge, or on appeal, presented evidence that the Form I-929 has been filed. Nor has the respondent asserted that he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel in these proceedings. Under the circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly denied a further continuance. The respondent has not asserted eligibility for any other relief from removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nathaly D. Henriquez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Shaheewa Jarrett Gelin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals the April 14, 2017, decision of the Immigration Judge. In that decision, the Immigration Judge granted the motion of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reconsider the decision of the prior Immigration Judge who had granted the respondent’s motion to reopen her 2007 in absentia removal proceedings. Upon reconsideration, the Immigration Judge denied reopening and ordered the respondent to be removed. The respondent also submits a motion to reopen sua sponte and remand. The DHS opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed and the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
The record reflects that the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and remand on May 2, 2017, and that she was removed from the United States on that day. It further reflects that a timely appeal was filed on her behalf on May 9, 2017. We find that we have jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal despite her removal from the United States. See Matter of Diaz-Garcia, 25 I&N Dec. 794 (BIA 2012) (the Board retains jurisdiction to consider a direct appeal where the removal occurred during the time within which to file an appeal or during the pendency of an appeal). We further find that, as the instant case arises in the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, we also have jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand. See Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Attn’y Gen., 462 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2006) (the Immigration Judge and the Board retain jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reopen filed by an alien who has been removed, but who is alleging that he failed to attend his removal hearing due to lack of notice).
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015; Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review all other issues under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
*2 The record reflects that the respondent appeared at two hearings, on October 26, 2006, and June 14, 2007, and was personally served with the notice of her following hearings, the next of which was scheduled for August 23, 2007. However, on August 23, 2007, the respondent failed to appear, and she was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia.
 
On March 3, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. She claimed that she attended court and was advised that she would receive notice of the next hearing in the mail, but she never received the notice. She further claimed that she learned in January, 2017, that an in absentia order had been entered in her case, and that her affidavit is sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of delivery by regular mail.
 
On March 20, 2017, an Immigration Judge found that the respondent was properly notified of the hearing scheduled for August 23, 2007. However, he granted reopening as a matter of discretion to allow the respondent to advise the court of any relief that may be available to her. He also granted a change of venue.
 
At the new venue, an Immigration Judge granted the DHS’ motion for reconsideration. He found that notice of the hearing had been properly served on the respondent, that she made no application for relief from removal, that the evidence did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the respondent did not adequately explain her delay of many years to seek reopening. He concluded that the respondent had not met her heavy burden to demonstrate that reopening was warranted. We affirm his findings.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge’s decision to grant reopening as a matter of discretion was proper, and that the subsequent decision to reconsider and deny reopening violated her constitutional right to due process because the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction or authority to reconsider a decision made by a different Immigration Judge. See Br. at 4-7. We find that the change of venue was proper and that the Immigration Judge at the new venue correctly exercised jurisdiction over the motion for reconsideration.
 
Further, an alien who faces removal is entitled under the constitution to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827, 831 (BIA 1994); Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276 (BIA 1982). In order to establish that her due process rights were violated, the respondent must prove that there was an error and that she was prejudiced. Id. The respondent has not shown either error or prejudice here.
 
We find no reason to address the respondent’s claim that reopening is warranted because she was preparing to apply for relief based on changed circumstances and a change in the law, including asylum and withholding of removal based on a claim of membership in a particular social group consisting of women who are unable to leave an abusive relationship in her country, protection under the Convention Against Torture, and a petition to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a U non-immigrant visa. See Br. at 7-9. Although the respondent offers an asylum application and a petition for a U non-immigrant visa, she has not shown that they have been filed or demonstrated that she is prima facie eligible for such relief. We conclude that the respondent has not met her heavy burden to establish that reopening is warranted or a reason to remand the record for further proceedings.
 
*3 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and her motion to reopen and remand will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sanjay Chaubey, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 13, 2017, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after entry of the final administrative decision sought to be reopened. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act. The respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings more than 10 years after entry of the final order is untimely. The respondent has not shown that any exception to this filing deadline applies.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).
 
The respondent asserts ineffective assistance of prior counsel. However, the respondent did not comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The order of removal indicates that the respondent did not file any application for relief. He has not made any specific allegations asserting that his failure to file an application for relief was due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Sua sponte reopening is reserved for truly exceptional cases. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). “The power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.” Id. at 984. The respondent has not shown circumstances that qualify as exceptional, and we therefore decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen this matter. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that sua sponte authority should be invoked sparingly, “not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Becoming potentially eligible for relief from removal after the entry of a final order is not, in and of itself, an exceptional circumstance that would justify sua sponte reopening of these proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that there is no indication in the Immigration Judge’s October 12, 2006, decision that it was issued after a hearing held in absentia. Moreover, even if it was, any related motion would be untimely unless there was a lack of proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). This was not alleged in the motion before the Immigration Judge, or otherwise established.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kyce Siddiqi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on February 19, 2016, after not appearing at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on February 15, 2017, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 16, 2017, denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that an “exceptional circumstance,” to wit, ineffective assistance of counsel prevented his appearance at the hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (stating that a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal); Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267, 268 (2d Cir. 2006) (setting forth the requirements for equitable tolling); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). According to the respondent, he received a Notice of Hearing, dated February 13, 2015, from the Immigration Court, which instructed him to appear on November 29, 2019. He states that he took the notice to his former counsel, and counsel did not instruct the respondent to notify the Immigration Court of any changes in his address. The respondent contends that counsel’s failure to notify him of his obligation to inform the Immigration Court of changes to his address resulted in the respondent not receiving notice for his February 19, 2016, hearing.
 
However, the February 13, 2015, Notice of Hearing informed the respondent of his obligation to update the Immigration Court with his most current address. In addition, according to former counsel’s February 14, 2017, letter to current counsel, he provided the respondent with a copy of the Notice to Appear on September 24, 2014, which advises the respondent of his obligation to report his current address to the Immigration Court. In light of the foregoing, the respondent has not established that the ineffective assistance of former counsel was the cause of his nonappearance at his hearing. It follows that we decline to equitably toll the 180-day period to file a motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances,” find the motion to be untimely filed, and we need not address whether the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lesley Irizarry-Hougan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brent D. Campbell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on December 15, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s written decision denying a previous motion to reopen these proceedings in which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia on May 19, 2015, under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondent again seeks reopening, averring that prior counsel deficiently represented her by not adequately advising her of her immigration hearing date and filing a deficient motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
In her July 24, 2015, declaration supporting her prior motion the respondent averred that she was “confused” about her court date and asked her prior counsel’s office to confirm the date, “but they did not have any information” (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider, October 6, 2015, at 21). We will not revisit our finding that this declaration - coupled with the other evidence supporting the previous motion - did not constitute exceptional circumstances to warrant rescission of her in absentia removal order, as a motion to reopen is not an opportunity to repeat previously-considered arguments. See INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991); see generally sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (e)(1) of the Act.
 
The respondent has now submitted a second declaration, claiming that a secretary from her prior counsel’s office informed her and her daughter in a May 18, 2015, telephone conversation that: “[Y]ou don’t have court tomorrow, until you get a new notice” (Respondent’s Mot. to Reopen, February 23, 2017, tab B at 19). The respondent has not adequately explained why her July 24, 2015, declaration omits the allegation that her prior counsel’s secretary provided erroneous information concerning her hearing date. Rather, the respondent waited until February 23, 2017 - well over a year after her October 6, 2015, motion - to raise this allegation for the first time. Under the circumstances, the respondent has not demonstrated that she diligently pursued her ineffective assistance of counsel claim to equitably toll the time and number limits on motions to reopen. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing that equitable tolling is predicated on alien identifying and pursuing an ineffective assistance claim with due diligence); Bataev v. Mukasey, 276 F. App’x. 581 (9th Cir. 2008) (affirming Board’s finding that alien did not act with due diligence, where he waited over 1 year to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*2 Nor has the respondent shown prejudice, where she acknowledges receiving the Immigration Court’s notice explicitly informing her of the May 19, 2015, hearing (Respondent’s Mot. to Reopen, February 23, 2017, tab B at 19). Irrespective of prior counsel’s secretary’s purportedly erroneous information, the respondent was aware that her immigration hearing was May 19, 2015. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, 778 F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th Cir. 2015) (an alien can show prejudice where counsel’s performance may have impacted the outcome of the case).
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional circumstance warranting sua sponte reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond Lahoud, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was granted voluntary departure on October 4, 2016. On December 28, 2016, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that we did not have jurisdiction. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on January 3, 2017. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on January 11, 2017. The respondent filed an appeal of that decision with this Board on February 8, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent also filed a motion to terminate proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.1
 
We have considered the arguments raised on appeal and find them unpersuasive. The respondent primarily argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge exhibited bias and prejudice throughout his proceedings. We reviewed the transcript and the Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2017, decision and find no evidence of bias or unfair treatment.
 
Moreover, we agree de novo with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (IJ at 1-2). Though the respondent complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent did not establish prejudice inasmuch as the respondent has not explained what, if any, relief is available to him that he was precluded from pursuing. The record indicates that the respondent’s prior counsel consulted with the respondent during his hearing and explained to the respondent his legal options (Tr. at 29). After their consultation, the respondent chose voluntary departure (Tr. at 28-20).
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has not established that his prior hearing was prejudiced due to ineffective assistance of counsel or bias, has not argued that he is eligible for any form of relief, and the transcript of the record reflects that the respondent knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2016, decision, we will dismiss the appeal. Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent also filed a motion to terminate. The respondent alleges in his motion to terminate that he is no longer removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), because one of his convictions for theft by unlawful taking has been vacated. A conviction that has been vacated by the criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). The same is not true, however, if a conviction is vacated for rehabilitative reasons. The respondent’s counsel asserts on appeal that the respondent’s family “sought post-conviction relief counsel to address claims that the offenses . . . were constitutionally defective” (Respondent’s Brief at 3). The respondent, however, has not presented any evidence detailing the reasoning behind the criminal court’s decision to vacate his theft offense. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (“Counsel’s arguments are not evidence . . .”). As we are unable to determine the reasons that the respondent was granted post-conviction relief, we conclude that the respondent has not met his burden of proving that his conviction no longer remains for immigration purposes. Even if the respondent’s argument is correct and he is no longer removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, he remains removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), due to his controlled substance convictions.2 The respondent did not argue below or on appeal that he is not removable due his controlled substance convictions. Accordingly, we will deny the respondent’s motion to terminate.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the motion denied.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed an unopposed motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, requesting that this Board reconsider our December 28, 2016, decision in light of Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). The motion was granted on January 19, 2017, and the record was remanded to this Board. The Third Circuit’s remand will be addressed in a separate decision.

We note that the respondent was previously placed in removal proceedings due to convictions for various controlled substance related offenses and was granted cancellation of removal (Exh. 1). The respondent has not asserted that the current charge of removal under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act is based upon the same conviction(s) that served as the basis for the charge of removal during his prior proceedings.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Janelle C. Cruz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 16, 2017, which denied his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The parties have provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record shows that the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on November 22, 2016, when he failed to appear for the hearing scheduled on that date (Exh. 3). The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen based on a claimed lack of notice of the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
For the reasons provided in the decision, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. The respondent’s claimed lack of notice of the hearing is predicated on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, whom he asserts failed to communicate to the Immigration Court the respondent’s change of address. However, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent did not substantially comply with the requirement of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (IJ at 3-4).
 
On appeal, the respondent has provided additional supporting evidence in addition to duplicate documents. Respondent’s Br., Exhs. 1, 7. However, our review is limited to the evidence of record before the Immigration Judge. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Even if we were to construe the submission of new evidence as a motion to reopen and remand, we find that such action is not warranted here. The retainer agreement the respondent submitted is not signed by him or by the attorney in question, so it does not establish that the attorney was in fact representing the respondent in previous removal proceedings. Respondent’s Br., Exh. 1. In addition, despite his claims in the new affidavit, the respondent has not yet provided proof that the attorney has been advised of the complaint against him and been afforded the opportunity to respond. Respondent’s Br., Exh. 7. Thus, the additional evidence submitted on appeal does not warrant reopening the record and remanding for consideration by the Immigration Judge. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1), 1003.23(b)(3). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely on March 30, 2017. The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Brazil, filed an untimely motion to reconsider on May 8, 2017. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B)(2017); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2017). We will consider the late-filed motion to reconsider, based on the respondent’s motion to accept its late filing. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion to reconsider, which will be denied.
 
The motion to reconsider again seeks to have the Board consider the respondent’s untimely appeal. This is based again on a claim that prior counsel did not inform the respondent about the Immigration Judge’s decision, mailed on January 11, 2017, and of her right to appeal to the Board. The motion to reconsider now includes a May 4, 2017, statement from former counsel, concerning his failure to notify the respondent of the Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2017, decision. As at the time of our March 30, 2017, decision, however, the respondent has not met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has also not shown that this case should be considered by the Board on certification. Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006) (Board has authority to consider a late appeal by certification under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c), under appropriate circumstances). The Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2017, decision denied a motion to reopen, which sought adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ineligible for such relief under section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act, due to the fact that she overstayed a 2010 grant of voluntary departure. The respondent has set forth nothing to suggest why she would be found eligible for adjustment of status despite the strict bar to relief.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wayani J. Taylor, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated May 27, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent timely appeals from that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, but we may review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge should have granted reopening. The respondent concedes that she received notice of her hearing when she was personally served with the Notice to Appear (NTA) in November 2005, but the respondent asserts that due to her youth, she did not understand her obligation to appear in court (Respondent’s Br. at 2-3, 6). Furthermore, the respondent claims that four months prior to her hearing, she filed a Form EOIR-33, apprising the court of her change of address, upon the advice of an immigration consultant.
 
An order of removal following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he or she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he or she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). A motion to reopen alleging lack of notice of the removal hearing, or that the respondent was in federal or state custody, may be filed at any time. However, a motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances, such as here, must be filed within 180 days after the entry of the removal order.
 
Upon review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances was filed beyond the 180 days allowed by statute. Thus, the motion was untimely. Even if timely-filed, the respondent’s motion does not establish the presence of exceptional circumstances to excuse her failure to appear at her hearing. Neither the respondent’s youth (she was 18 years old) nor ignorance about immigration proceedings would constitute an exceptional circumstance. Rather, it appears that the respondent believed that by filing a change of address, a new notice would be sent to her containing a new hearing date (Respondent’s Br. at 3-4, 6) (unnumbered).1
 
*2 We likewise find no merit to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Exh. 5) (respondent’s affidavit fails to name the immigration consultant). See generally Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F3d. 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008) (stating but not explicitly holding that Lozada applies to claims of ineffective assistance rendered by non-attorneys). In claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, this Circuit requires a showing of prejudice which the respondent has not made in this case. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (agreeing with the Ninth Circuit that prejudice must be established). For all of these reasons, reopening was properly denied.
 
With regard to sua sponte reopening, we determine that sua sponte reopening is not merited as a matter of discretion. The facts in this case do not present an “exceptional situation,” particularly in consideration of the lack of due diligence by the respondent to clarify her immigration status in the past 9 years. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002). In addition, while the respondent desires reopening in order to pursue adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen, the respondent does not appear statutorily eligible for relief due to the manner of her entry into the United States.2 See section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Since the respondent was not physically present in the United States for at least one year prior to the issuance of the NTA, she also appears statutorily ineligible for the privilege of voluntary departure. See section 240B(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent claims that her immigration consultant failed to advise her to file a motion to change venue with the change of address form (Form EOIR-33). While the respondent submitted a copy of a change of address form, the record does not contain the original form. In addition, even if the respondent filed a motion to change venue, the respondent would not be excused from appearing, as scheduled, until the motion was granted. See Immigration Court Practice Manual, Chapter 5: 5.10(c).

The respondent appears to want to proceed abroad for consular processing (Respondent’s Br. at 5) (unnumbered). She may be eligible to do so under the new rules for a provisional unlawful presence waiver under 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(3).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wael M. Ahmad, Esquire
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 28, 2017, when we entered a final administrative order dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his second motion to reopen his in absentia removal proceedings. On April 5, 2017, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, submitted the instant motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He requests a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion exceeds the number limitations for motions to reopen, and it will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(A). The respondent’s stay request will also be denied.
 
The respondent contends that reopening sua sponte is warranted. He declares that his former counsel told him that he would request a change of venue and that he did not have to appear for his hearing. See Exhibit A, ¶¶ 4-5. The respondent states that he is aware that he could file a bar complaint against his former counsel but has not done so because his former counsel has already conceded that his representation was ineffective. Id, ¶ 9.
 
The respondent offers his affidavit and a printout of emails that purport to be between his current counsel and his former counsel. See Exhibits A and B. One of the emails indicates that his former counsel stated that a Lozada motion is appropriate at this time and that he will do a letter or sign an affidavit to help the respondent’s current counsel. See Exhibit B at 1. However, the respondent has not offered a letter or affidavit from his former counsel. The evidence is not adequate to demonstrate that the respondent’s former counsel conceded that his representation was ineffective. Further, the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the respondent complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as required by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in whose jurisdiction the instant case arises. See Lin Xing Jiang v. Holder, 639 F.3d 751, 754-55 (7th Cir. 2012) (the alien must satisfy the criteria set forth in Lozada to support a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel); Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 368-69 (7th Cir. 2012) (satisfying the Lozada requirements is a necessary condition to obtaining reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 The respondent has not met his heavy burden of proving that his removal proceedings should be reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). We find that an exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen is not warranted. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, as the respondent’s motion exceeds the number limitations for motions to reopen, it will be denied, and his request for a stay of removal will also be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
P. Mercer Cauley, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hilary Rainone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 On January 13, 2017, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 17, 2016, decision.1 The Immigration Judge determined, inter alia, that the respondent is removable as an alien inadmissible at the time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1282(a)(6)(C)(i)(2016), for procuring a visa or other documentation, or admission through fraud or willful mirepresentation of a material fact (See Exh. 1B). See section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) (2017). On February 13, 2017, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider with the Board, and on May 30, 2017, the respondent filed an amendment to the motion to reconsider. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); section 240(c)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2017). On April 12, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking adjustment of status. See section 240(C)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes reopening and reconsideration, and the respondent has objected to the opposition by the DHS. The motions will be denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent contests the Immigration Judge’s findings and conclusions, we emphasize that a motion to reconsider is not an opportunity to raise issues that could have been raised on appeal, or to reiterate arguments previously considered and rejected on appeal. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); Matter of Guevara, 20 I&N Dec. 238 (BIA 1991). The respondent has offered no persuasive arguments to convince us that we erred in fact or law in our prior order. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. With the following comments, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s claim that she was not yet separated from her second husband in May 2010 lacked credibility, and determined that the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent now reiterates her argument that the Immigration Judge did not properly consider an order by the District Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, amending the date of her separation from her second husband from 2009 to 2011. As the Immigration Judge noted, however, the district court’s amended order was based entirely on the facts provided by the respondent. Further, the district court’s order was but one factor that the Immigration Judge considered in rendering his adverse credibility determination. In our prior decision, we found no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including his finding with regard to credibility of the respondent’s testimony. The respondent has put forth no new arguments or evidence that would now persuade us to alter our prior finding.
 
*2 The respondent further argues that she was denied due process because the Immigration Judge prevented her ex-husband from testifying at her removal hearing. The respondent, however, was provided with an opportunity to present witness testimony, including the testimony of her ex-husband. The record reveals that on February 3, 2015, the Immigration Judge continued the proceedings to a date convenient to the respondent, the DHS attorney, and the Immigration Judge to enable the respondent to present her ex-husband as a witness (Tr. at 50-58). At a continued hearing on March 2, 2015, however, the respondent appeared before the Immigration Judge without her ex-husband (Tr. at 58). Moreover, the respondent’s attorney did not request a further continuance at that time. We also note that in her appeal brief the respondent stated that despite great effort, she was unable to bring her ex-husband to the Immigration Court because “he was simply not being cooperative and refused to appear” (Respondent’s Appeal Br. at 4). Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the Immigration Judge to commence the respondent’s individual hearing. In sum, it has not been shown that the respondent’s ex-husband was prevented from testifying, and that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will also be denied. The respondent seeks reopening to enable her to apply for adjustment of status based on a pending visa petition that her husband, whom she married on September 30, 2015, filed on her behalf. The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of an attorney who, she claims, advised her husband that he did not need to file a visa petition on her behalf. The respondent, however, has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before this Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).2 See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006) (requiring that aliens raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims in immigration proceedings show at least substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements). Therefore, we will not consider the respondent’s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel further.3
 
Moreover, it has been determined in these proceedings that the respondent, who was found to be inadmissible at the time of adjustment of status for seeking admission through fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact, does not merit a waiver of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion. The respondent has offered no new evidence with this motion to persuade us now that reopening for further consideration of possible discretionary relief is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). See also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
*3 Accordingly, the respondent’s motions to reopen and reconsider will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed O. Gonzalez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On June 6, 2012, an Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal against the respondent. On July 6, 2012, the respondent through counsel filed a motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order of removal, which the Immigration Judge denied on August 31, 2012. The respondent did not appeal the denial of the motion.
 
On June 27, 2016, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a second motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. On July 21, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, now appeals. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In general, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the regulations provide that an alien may file one motion to reopen, and any such motion must be filed within 90 days of the entry of the final administrative order of removal. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The Act and regulations provide an exception to the general rule in the case of an alien who seeks to rescind an in absentia order of removal. An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded by a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances,1 or a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice in accordance with section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. See section 240(c)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The Board and the Immigration Courts also have reopened cases filed more than 90 days after a final administrative order in which an alien proves that his claim was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and when the motion was filed within a reasonable time after discovering the ineffective assistance. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires that (1) the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf; (2) the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion reflect whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
*2 The regulations provide that a motion to reopen removal proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the respondent establishes prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). An applicant demonstrates prima facie eligibility when the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied. Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the July 27, 2016, motion to reopen because it was time-barred and number-barred. The motion was filed more than 4 years after the in absentia order of removal, and was the respondent’s second motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(A), (C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C).
 
The respondent claims that at the time of the in absentia order of removal he was eligible for adjustment of status based on his January 25, 2012, marriage to United States citizen Ms. Ocanas (Respondent’s Br. at 4, 10). Thus, he asserts that his prior attorney’s ineffectiveness in failing to notify him of his June 6, 2012, hearing prejudiced his ability to obtain relief in the form of adjustment of status. In support of this claim, he submitted on appeal his and Ms. Ocanas’ marriage certificate (Respondent’s Br. at 10, Attached Tab A).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments. First, the respondent did not sufficiently demonstrate that he did not receive notice of the June 6, 2012, hearing. The Immigration Judge properly concluded that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien). Although the respondent provided copies of returned mail from his prior attorney as evidence that she did not inform the respondent of the June 6, 2012, hearing, we have no way of knowing the contents of the returned mail, including whether the notice of the hearing was one of the returned mail items (Respondent’s Br. at 5-6, 13; Motion to Reopen at 5-6, 9, Attached Tab D).2
 
Second, the respondent did not show actual prejudice with respect to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 6-7, 12). The respondent did not provide any evidence of his marriage to Ms. Ocanas with the July 27, 2016, motion to reopen, and the record as of the filing of that motion did not reflect that the respondent was ever married to Ms. Ocanas (I.J. at 2).3 Rather, the record reflected only that the respondent divorced Ms. Chavez on September 1, 2011, and married Ms. Sanchez on November 16, 2015 (I.J. at 2; Motion to Reopen at 11, Tabs G, P).
 
*3 Also, the 2012 marriage to Ms. Ocanas alone did not establish prima facie evidence of eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act. The record does not contain evidence that Ms. Ocanas filed a Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) on the respondent’s behalf such that he would have been eligible to receive an immigrant visa, or that the respondent otherwise had an immigrant visa immediately available to him at the time of the June 6, 2012, hearing (I.J. at 2). See section 245(a) of the Act. Thus, the respondent has not shown that any ineffectiveness by his prior attorney in not filing an adjustment of status application caused the respondent to suffer actual prejudice.
 
Finally, although the respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s August 31, 2012, denial of the motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order, the denial decision was correct. In the July 12, 2012, motion the respondent stated only that he was unable to attend the June 6, 2012, hearing because he was working off-shore. The Immigration Judge properly concluded that this did not constitute exceptional circumstances as contemplated by section 240(e)(1) of the Act. The respondent’s work schedule was not beyond his control, given that he had over 3 months to change his schedule or alert the Immigration Judge of the conflict and request a new hearing (I.J. dated August 31, 2012, at 1).
 
For these reasons we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the July 27, 2016, motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), states that “‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.”

The Immigration Judge issued the June 6, 2012, decision after a hearing on February 1, 2012, which is 3 months before the earliest date stamped on the returned mail. Our review of the digital audio recording reflects that the respondent’s prior attorney was present at the February 1, 2012, hearing.

The respondent also did not provide any evidence of his marriage to Ms. Ocanas with his July 6, 2012, motion to reopen. As stated previously, that motion indicated only that the respondent was unable to attend the June 6, 2012, hearing because he was working off-shore.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Grace Ruth Kennedy, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Samuel “Alex” Brown
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 19, 2016, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge issued a removal order on February 14, 2013, upon granting the DHS’ unopposed motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). In her motion to reopen filed on August 8, 2016, the respondent asserted that it was unfair that the prior decision was rendered without a hearing; she points out she had previously appeared several times before the Immigration Judge. The respondent also emphasized her equities in this country that include her six United States citizen children, some of whom have medical issues. She also submitted proof that her United States citizen mother filed a visa petition on her behalf which was approved on March 28, 2016, and had a priority date of April 30, 2015 (Resp. Br. at 3; attachment F).
 
The Immigration Judge found the motion to reopen to be untimely, which the respondent has not contested (I.J. at 2). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (setting out a general 90-day filing deadline for motions to reopen). He further declined to sua sponte reopen her proceedings. The Immigration Judge recounted the history of the case, and inter alia, concluded that the respondent had ample opportunity to challenge the DHS’ motion to pretermit below. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in that she waited over 3 years to file her motion after her removal, and more than one year after the visa petition was approved. He further noted that the motion was supported by attorney statements rather than an affidavit from the respondent.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). Upon consideration of the factors addressed by the Immigration Judge, we agree that the respondent has not shown an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Immigration Court’s or the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We therefore will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision in this regard.1
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent contends her due process rights were violated because the Immigration Judge denied her motion to reopen without providing a hearing on this matter (Resp. Br. at 2-3). As the respondent was afforded the opportunity to review the record and provide evidence and legal arguments in support of her motion to reopen, she was given a fundamentally fair proceeding (I.J. at 2). See Dukane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2005). The respondent has not met her burden to demonstrate that she was deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused her substantial prejudice by establishing that the outcome of this case would have been different but for the alleged error. Indrawati v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 779 F.3d 1284, 1299 (11th Cir. 2015).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge failed to consider the criteria for equitably tolling the filing deadline for her motion to reopen (Resp. Br. at 3-5). In connection with the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte authority to reopen her removal order, the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s due diligence in filing her motion and whether some extraordinary circumstance stood in her way of a timely filing (I.J. at 2-3). See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 717 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir. 2013). We do not disturb this determination. Moreover, the respondent has not identified any basis to toll the deadline due to ineffective assistance of counsel, or met the filing requirements for such a claim. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra; Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). As the respondent has not presented any basis to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge or reopen these proceedings, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Carlos Ramirez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On March 10, 2017, the Board dismissed the respondents’ appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2016, decision denying their motion to reopen and rescind orders of removal entered in absentia on July 21, 2016. On April 6, 2017, the lead respondent, Juana Pascual Toledo Andres (AXXX XXX XXX), and her minor child, Angelina Marilu Cristobal Toledo (AXXX XXX XXX), filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind with the Board. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The motion will be denied.
 
An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances or upon a motion filed at any time if she did not receive proper notice of the hearing or she was in Federal or States custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. See section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
The record reflects that on March 25, 2016, the lead respondent (hereinafter referred to in the singular as “the respondent”) received oral and written notice of the hearing scheduled for July 21, 2016. In her motion to reopen and rescind before the Immigration Judge and on appeal, the respondent argued that she did not receive proper notice of an April 4, 2016, hearing. The Immigration Judge and the Board noted, however, that there was no hearing scheduled for that date in these proceedings.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent asserts that she did not appear at the July 21, 2016, hearing because the minor respondent was sick (Respondent’s Declaration). She further asserts that after she received the order of removal in the mail, she sought the assistance of an individual whom she believed to be an attorney to prepare and file the motion before the Immigration Judge (Respondent’s Declaration). She also claims that although she attempted to provide the nonattorney with a receipt for the child’s medication, he based the motion to reopen and rescind on a claim of improper notice (Respondent’s Declaration).
 
In her motion to reopen and rescind filed before the Board, the respondent raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the nonattorney who allegedly prepared and filed the prior motion and appeal on her behalf.1 See Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that equitable tolling is appropriate where the alien was “defrauded by an individual purporting to provide legal representation”); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (discussing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board). Specifically, she alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of the nonattorney for failure to argue that her failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” (Respondent’s Motion at 10).
 
*2 The 180-filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen and rescind may be equitably tolled based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011). The alien, however, must establish, inter alia, that she suffered prejudice because of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 562 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. In the context of an ineffective assistance claim, prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
The respondent has not established that she suffered prejudice due to ineffective assistance of counsel because, upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we find that she has not shown that exceptional circumstance prevented her from appearing at the July 21, 2016, hearing. The respondent claims that although “[she] knew that [she] needed to appear in court that morning,” she was concerned about the minor respondent’s health because the child was “very sick” with fever and vomiting (Respondent’s Declaration). The respondent has offered a receipt from a clinic in support of her claim (Motion Tab E). The document bears the name “Angelina Critobal.” It does not, however, reflect a diagnosis, prognosis, course of treatment, or any other information regarding the nature and seriousness of any illness. See Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding that the alien’s lack of evidence regarding the severity of his asthma attack restricted Board’s ability to determine if illness was exceptional); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (holding that the lack of medical evidence or other evidence establishing, in detail, the seriousness of the alien’s illness is a factor to consider in determining if he or she has met the burden of proof for exceptional circumstances excusing a failure to appear). Further, the respondent, who knew of her obligation to appear at the scheduled hearing, has neither asserted nor offered any evidence that she attempted to inform the Immigration Court of absence or of the reasons for the absence. See Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, supra (finding that the Board’s consideration of the alien’s failure to notify the Immigration Court of the reason for his absence was not improper).
 
In sum, equitable tolling of the 180-day filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen and rescind based on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not warranted where the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice as a result of the ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, we find that no other exception to the regulatory restrictions imposed on motions to reopen applies to this motion. We recognize that the respondent has offered an application for asylum and withholding of removal (Form I-589) with the instant motion. She has not, however, offered evidence regarding changed circumstances or conditions in her native country, Guatemala, since the scheduled hearing on July 21, 2016, to warrant reopening pursuant to section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Therefore, to the extent that the respondent seeks reopening to apply for asylum and withholding of removal, the instant motion will be denied as untimely and number-barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the respondents’ motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

APPLICATION: None
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of El Salvador, have appealed from the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2016, decision denying the lead respondent’s request for a continuance and ordering the respondents’ removal from the United States.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal and motion for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s determination that she is removable as charged (Tr. at 6;Resp. Br. at 2). At the hearing, the respondent’s counsel indicated that the respondent applied prosecutorial discretion and no other applications for relief (Tr. at 7). The DHS stated that it declined to exercise prosecutorial discretion (Id.). As the respondent conceded that she was subject to removal and did not apply for any relief from removal, the Immigration Judge ordered her removed from the United States (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 8).
 
On appeal, the respondent, through new counsel, asserts that her prior counsel was ineffective in that she “unilaterally decided not to allow the [r]respondent to file an asylum application” (Resp. Br. at 2). The respondent moves to remand the case for a new hearing.
 
The respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant motion. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board). In this case, the respondent has not complied with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements. The respondent did not provide detailed affidavits attesting to the facts establishing ineffective assistance and setting forth the agreements that she reportedly entered into with her attorney. She has not informed her prior counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned of the allegations leveled against her and given her an opportunity to respond. Nor have she indicated whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. The respondent has failed entirely to comply with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements, which the Eleventh Circuit has determined are not unduly onerous. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Costa Rica. On August 10, 2015, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On April 13, 2017, the respondent filed the current motion to reopen. The respondent alleges that proceedings should be reopened and remanded due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition. The motion is denied.
 
The motion to reopen is untimely filed, as well as number barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). We decline to equitably toll the time and number limitations because the respondent has not shown prejudice, see Dukane v. Atty Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). She does not demonstrate how the result would have been different in this proceeding but for the performance of her former counsel.
 
The respondent asserts that her former counsel told her not to comply with the order of voluntary departure. However, even if she had voluntarily departed, she would not have been able to consular process based on her marriage to her current husband. The DHS’s records are clear that the respondent entered into a fraudulent marriage (Motion, Exh. F), and her voluntary departure would not have expunged or negated the documentation on file with DHS. As such, the visa petition filed on her behalf by her current husband would have been subject to the bar set forth in section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c), even if she had voluntarily departed and attempted to pursue consular processing.
 
The respondent argues that she was not provided with the opportunity to complete her case before DHS because former counsel did not submit a response. However, we do not have authority over proceedings before DHS. Moreover, the respondent’s generalized statement that she did not enter into a fraudulent marriage is inadequate to overcome the evidence of record, as well as the Immigration Judge’s findings, which we affirmed, that she entered into a fraudulent marriage. As such, the respondent has not shown prejudice.
 
Last, we decline to exercise our sua sponte discretionary authority to reopen proceedings because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The Immigration Judge found, and the Board affirmed, that the respondent entered into a fraudulent marriage for the purpose of evading immigration laws. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nathaniel J. Damren, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey D. Clark
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 23, 2016, granting the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen sua sponte and terminating his proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was ordered removed by the Immigration Judge on October 15, 2012, based on his June 26, 2012, conviction for the offense of petit theft in violation of Idaho Code section 18-2407(2), for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 365 days. In particular, the Immigration Judge found the respondent’s offense to be an aggravated felony as defined by section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G). The respondent was offered a continuance pending the outcome of collateral litigation on his criminal conviction but declined and was ordered removed. The respondent waived appeal and was removed on January 28, 2013.
 
Subsequent to the respondent’s removal, a Magistrate granted the State’s motion to summarily dismiss his petition for post-conviction relief. However, that decision was reversed on appeal. The State thereafter appealed and the appeals court affirmed the lower court’s decision, holding that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel in his plea proceedings regarding the immigration consequences of his plea. See Keserovic v. State, 345 P.3d 1024, 1029-31 (Idaho Ct. App. 2015) (citing Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010)). Upon remand to the criminal court, the parties agreed to the entry of an order amending the period of incarceration for the conviction nunc pro tunc to 364 days, and an order was entered to that effect on August 28, 2015. Approximately 9 months later, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen and terminate with the Immigration Judge requesting he exercise his sua sponte authority to grant the motion and arguing that, in light of the reduction in his sentence, his conviction was no longer an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act.
 
On May 23, 2016, the Immigration Judge, finding the respondent’s motion untimely, nevertheless granted the motion sua sponte and terminated the proceedings. The Immigration Judge found that, although the respondent had been removed from the United States, the motion could be granted sua sponte because the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where the case arises, “ha[d] ordered that a motion may be filed subsequent to a respondent’s removal, where a conviction has been vacated.” For his authority, the Immigration Judge cited Contreras-Bocanegra v. Holder, 678 F.3d 811 (10th Cir. 2012). In Contreras-Bocanegra, the Tenth Circuit held that the post-departure bar to filing a motion to reopen proceedings was ultra vires as applied to the statutory right to file one motion to reopen because, it found, the departure bar regulation contravenes “the right to file a motion to reopen, regardless of whether [the movant] ha[s] departed the United States.” See id. at 819.
 
*2 The DHS appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision contending that he erred in granting the respondent’s untimely motion because, notwithstanding Contreras-Bocengra, the motion is barred by the regulatory post-departure bar. See DHS’s Brief at 5-8. The DHS also argues that the Immigration Judge failed to address the requisite gross miscarriage of justice required for a collateral attack on a prior removal order and failed to justify the use of his sua sponte authority. See id. at 8-12. The respondent has filed an opposition to the DHS’s appeal. Notwithstanding the DHS’s contentions on appeal, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision sua sponte reopening the respondent’s proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2017) (de novo review).
 
The sole reason the respondent’s conviction was amended to a sentence of less than a year in prison was because he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the underlying plea proceedings, as reflected in the published Idaho Court of Appeals decision. Therefore, the respondent’s original plea was constitutionally defective. Given this fact, the aggravated felony charge, which is the sole charge of removability was, in essence, void from its inception since it was based on a constitutionally defective conviction. Therefore, we find, based on the rationale of our decision in Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009), that applying the departure-bar under circumstances such as these would give greater force to the removal order than it is entitled to as a matter of law, since the order itself was void from its inception.
 
Accordingly, the DHS’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The DHS’s appeal is dismissed
 
Blair O’Connor
FOR THE BOARD
Board Member Roger A. Pauley respectfully dissents. It is the majority order that is ultra vires. We lack jurisdiction to reopen sua sponte because the departure bar regulation precludes such action. See, e.g., Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288 (5th Cir. 2009). Contreras-Bocanegra v. Holder, 678 F.3d 811 (10th Cir. 2012), is not to the contrary since the Act does not afford an alien a right to file an untimely motion and therefore the departure bar regulation is not in conflict with the Act as regards an untimely motion. See Macias v. Holder, 590 Fed. Appx. 829 (10th Cir. 2015) (Gorsuch, J.). Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009), is irrelevant.

ORDER:
 
*1 While the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 14, 2017, decision remained before the Board, the Department of Homeland Security filed a motion accompanied by evidence in support of its claim that the conviction underlying the respondent’s removability was vacated on constitutional grounds.1 See Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010) (holding that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that a conviction vacated by the criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes). The respondent has not opposed the motion. Upon consideration, these removal proceedings are terminated without prejudice and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
M. Elizabeth Hawkins, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hana A. Sato
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States after determining that he had abandoned his opportunity to seek relief. This matter was before the Board on October 5, 2016, when we affirmed without opinion the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in the Immigration Court. On November 28, 2016, the respondent filed the present motion with the Board, seeking to reopen proceedings on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board has considered the opposition of Department of Homeland Security to the motion, but in consideration of the entirety of the circumstances presented in this matter, the motion will be granted.
 
It appears from the record that counsel wholly failed to file an application for relief and made misrepresentations concerning her failure to act. We are satisfied that the respondent has substantially met applicable procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). As counsel’s performance may have affected the outcome of the case before the Immigration Judge, the motion makes a showing of prejudice to the respondent. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). The Board will, therefore, reopen these proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to afford the respondent the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible. We express no opinion as to the outcome, and on remand the parties should have the opportunity to present any relevant evidence and argument that they may have. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: These removal proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sanjay Sobti, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed his third motion since our January 31, 2014, decision reopening the proceedings for the limited purpose of reinstating the 60-day voluntary departure period specified in the Immigration Judge’s January 15, 2013, decision. The respondent now seeks to withdraw the voluntary departure order, notwithstanding his earlier request to reinstate it, in order to restore his eligibility for adjustment of status in connection with an approved marriage-based visa petition. The respondent avers that prior counsel deficiently represented him by not requesting withdrawal of the voluntary departure order, not advising the respondent of the implications of not complying with the voluntary departure order, and otherwise not taking steps to maintain the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status. See generally section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1)(B). The motion will be denied, as the respondent has not shown that an exception to the time and number limits applies. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
While the respondent seeks equitable tolling of the time and number limitations on motions to reopen based upon prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance, the respondent has not demonstrated that he diligently pursued the claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing that equitable tolling is predicated on alien identifying and pursuing an ineffective assistance claim with due diligence). At the very latest, the respondent knew or should have known of the alleged deficient representation when we issued our July 31, 2014, decision, a copy of which was mailed directly to the respondent. In particular, that decision discusses the respondent’s ineligibility for adjustment of status, because of his noncompliance with the Immigration Judge’s voluntary departure order - i.e. the voluntary departure bar. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007); Lopez-Vasquez v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1072, 1080 (9th Cir. 2013) (to prevail on a motion to reopen an alien must establish prima facie eligibility for relief). It was incumbent upon the respondent to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim at that time, rather than waiting nearly 3 years to file the current motion.
 
*2 Nor has the respondent shown prejudice. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, 11% F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th Cir. 2015) (an alien can show prejudice where counsel’s performance may have impacted the outcome of the case). Notwithstanding the respondent’s assertion that prior counsel did not inform him that he was required to depart the United States within 60 days, the Immigration Judge thoroughly advised the respondent of the consequences of not complying with the voluntary departure order (Tr. at 19-20). And the respondent’s purportedly limited English-speaking ability is insufficient, given his expressed understanding of warnings in his Spanish language translated colloquy with the Immigration Judge. (Tr. at 11, 19-20). Further, the Board’s January 31, 2014, decision granting the respondent’s request to reinstate the voluntary departure period reiterated these warnings.
 
Finally, the respondent has not established an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Azin Arbab, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 1, 2016. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent another continuance and ordered him removed from the United States to Mexico. The record will be remanded.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel where one of his previous attorneys from the Katz Law Office, Jessica Hernandez, Esquire, failed to submit pertinent information and documents on the date the respondent’s individual hearing was scheduled, as requested by the Immigration Judge. At the hearing on September 9, 2015, the Immigration Judge granted a continuance based on a visa petition filed on October 24, 2014, on the respondent’s behalf by his United States citizen wife, who is the mother of his United States citizen child (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 8-9). Due to the respondent’s criminal history, the Immigration Judge also requested that the respondent’s attorney submit several documents at the next hearing, including a copy of the respondent’s criminal conviction records.
 
At the next hearing, on June 1, 2016, the respondent appeared with another attorney from the Katz Law Office, who stated that he had been assigned the case only one week earlier, after the prior attorney assigned to this case, Jessica Hernandez, had suddenly left the law practice and not left detailed notes about the case. The Immigration Judge noted that a number of attorneys from that firm had filed Notices of Appearance on the respondent’s behalf. He further noted that the respondent did not comply with the request for documents made by the Immigration Court and found no good cause to grant a further continuance (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 13 and 16).
 
Although we understand the frustration noted by the Immigration Judge in the handling of this case by the respondent’s prior attorneys, all from the same law firm, the respondent’s arguments on appeal, including his affidavit, are persuasive that he may have received ineffective assistance of counsel from Ms. Hernandez. Even though it does not appear that the respondent has met all the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we are persuaded by the arguments on appeal that Ms. Hernandez appears to have abandoned his case and there was insufficient time for the following attorney assigned to the respondent’s case to prepare and submit the required documents. Under these circumstances, we find that a remand is justified to provide the respondent with an opportunity to pursue his claims for relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elizabeth I. Treacy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In an order dated January 18, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the Government’s motion to remand. The Government sought a remand for the Board to “clarify its conclusion that [respondent] did not comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N 637 (BIA 1988).” After further consideration, we will again dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, who claims ineffective assistance by his former counsel, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 21, 2011. Notice is not at issue. As such, a motion to reopen based upon “exceptional circumstances” causing his failure to appear must have been filed within 180 days of the in absentia order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit). The respondent, however, did not file his motion to reopen until December 21, 2015. Thus, his motion was untimely.
 
Upon further review, we find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365 (7th Cir. 2012) (requiring compliance with the Matter of Lozada procedures to establish ineffective assistance of counsel). Specifically, in the instant case, the respondent (1) submitted two personal affidavits regarding his former counsel’s representation of him; (2) presented evidence that he advised her of his allegations of ineffectiveness and submitted her response to those allegations; and (3) provided an explanation as to why he did not file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
However, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not demonstrated ineffective assistance by his former counsel (I.J. at 5). The respondent argues that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not advising him of the consequences of failing to appear at his scheduled September 21, 2011, hearing. However, the record reflects that the respondent did attend his June 8, 2011, hearing with his former counsel, and was served with a notice of hearing advising him of the consequences of failing to appear (I.J. at 4). The respondent has not presented documentary evidence to establish that he was in any way prevented from reading the advisals, or that his former attorney advised him in contradiction to those advisals. Thus, the respondent’s claim that he was unaware of the consequences for not appearing at his September 21, 2011, hearing is unfounded and contradicted by the record of this case. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that equitable tolling is warranted in this case. See El- Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2012); Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006). The respondent has not articulated what effort, if any, he made to pursue his rights during the 4 year period from the entry of his in absentia removal order and the filing of his motion to reopen.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening should be invoked to overcome the untimeliness of his motion. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, as we again decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda L. Walker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Mexico, appeals from the November 2, 2016, decision of an Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings conducted in absentia on June 30, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. The record reflects that the notice of hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent at the address he provided in the Notice to Appear (NTA), but it was returned as undeliverable by the postal service (I.J. at 1; Exhs. 1-3). While the respondent in his motion alleges that the address was entered incorrectly, the respondent signed the NTA, signifying the correctness of the address. Due process was satisfied here because the method of service was reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reached the alien. See United States v. Estrada-Trochez, 66 F.3d 733, 733-36 (5th Cir. 1995).
 
A respondent is not entitled to rescission of a removal order where the failure to receive actual notice of the time of the hearing is the result of his failure to comply with the obligation to keep the Immigration Court apprised of his current mailing address. The alien who evades notice cannot reopen the removal hearing. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir. 2009) (finding alien’s failure to keep the Immigration Court apprised of his current mailing address is grounds for denying rescission of a removal order). Consequently, even if we accept the respondent’s assertion that the address was incorrectly entered into the NTA, he did not sufficiently show that his failure to receive actual notice was not due to his neglect of his obligation to correct his address. Moreover, as the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent failed to provide an affidavit or other evidence with the motion to establish what his correct address was at the time the NOH was mailed.
 
On appeal, the respondent through new counsel now alleges he is the victim of ineffective legal assistance from previous counsel, Brett Pouncey, who filed the motion to reopen. Specifically, the respondent alleges that Mr. Pouncey failed to advise the respondent that he needed to support the motion with an affidavit or other evidence. While the respondent’s current counsel maintains in the appeal brief that the respondent will inform Mr. Pouncey of the allegations lodged against him and a copy will be provided to the state bar, no evidence was proffered to support this assertion. Counsel’s arguments are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). Consequently, the respondent has not complied with the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (court requires strict Lozada compliance); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir. 2000) (the Board does not abuse its discretion by requiring compliance with Lozada).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kwadwo Addo-Prempeh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely filed and is denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen.1 The respondent’s status as the beneficiary of a relatively recently approved visa petition does not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the applicable filing deadlines.2 See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of the present motion. Nor has she demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

To the extent the respondent claims that she received ineffective assistance from former counsel, she has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing a claim against former counsel, including the requirement that she show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).

The record before us does not reflect that the Department of Homeland Security has joined this motion. If such should become the case, the motion can be refiled. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David L. Wilson, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s October 24, 2016, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
An Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on September 27, 2013, because he failed to appear for the hearing. On July 27, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the September 27, 2013, removal order. The DHS stated that it did not oppose the respondent’s motion.1 On October 24, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s address in Minnesota, and the respondent did not rebut the presumption that he received the notice (I.J. at 3). In addition, the Immigration Judge found that the evidence indicates that the respondent chose not to attend the hearing and that he does not have a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he cannot show that he suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorneys’ actions (I.J. at 3-4).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have reopened the proceedings because the DHS did not oppose the motion. He also argues that he has shown ineffective assistance of counsel, prejudice by his former attorneys’ actions, and that he exercised due diligence so that the filing deadline for his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. The respondent further argues that the Board should reopen the proceedings under its sua sponte authority.
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that his failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act; or (2) at any time in which he establishes that he did not have proper notice of the hearing in which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent received notice of his September 27, 2013, hearing because the hearing notice was mailed to his address in Minnesota, which he provided upon his release from custody (I.J. at 3). The respondent has not rebutted the presumption that he received notice because the notice of hearing was properly addressed and sent by regular mail according to normal office procedures (I.J. at 3). We discern no clear error in this finding. While the respondent claims on appeal that he did not know about the hearing date and that his attorney did not notify him, the record shows that the hearing notice was sent directly to him and that his attorney had not filed a notice of appearance with the Immigration Court at the time the hearing notice was sent (I.J. at 2-3).
 
*2 Thus, because the respondent had notice of his hearing he can seek reopening of the proceedings solely upon the basis of exceptional circumstances and only within 180 days of the removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion is therefore untimely because it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia removal order. Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown ineffective assistance of counsel resulting in prejudice and thus cannot show exceptional circumstances. First, we discern no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the evidence of record shows that the respondent’s prior attorneys did not properly file a notice of appearance before his September 27, 2013, hearing (I.J. at 2). In addition, the respondent’s affidavit submitted with a June 3, 2014, motion to rescind states that he chose not to attend the hearing because he lived far away and could not afford to make the trip to New York, among other reasons (I.J. at 3-4; Motion to Rescind at Exhibit K, page 62). The respondent argues on appeal that he did not understand the contents of the affidavit, but as the Immigration Judge found, he did not totally disavow the affidavit (I.J. at 4). Moreover, the record shows that the respondent’s prior attorney called the Immigration Court on September 26, 2013, stating that the respondent would not be attending the hearing the next day (I.J. at 4). While the respondent argues that his prior attorney acted incompetently by not filing a motion for change of venue, as the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent knew about the hearing and was still required to appear even if a motion for change of venue had been filed (I.J. at 4 n.5). Because the respondent has not shown prejudice from his prior attorney’s actions he cannot make out an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.2
 
The respondent further argues that even if he has not met the regulatory requirements for rescinding the in absentia order, the Board should reopen the proceedings because the DHS did not oppose his motion to reopen and rescind. However, to prevail on a motion to rescind an in absentia order of removal, the respondent must meet the strict requirements outlined in the regulation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353, 357 (2d Cir. 2006). As discussed above, the respondent has not shown lack of notice of the hearing date or exceptional circumstances for failing to appear.
 
Moreover, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that reopening is warranted pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent’s motion does not establish an “exceptional” situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On November 4, 2016, the respondent and the DHS filed a joint motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order. The Immigration Judge denied the joint motion on November 10, 2016. That decision is not the subject of this appeal.

2

Even if the respondent showed ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not shown that he exercised due diligence during the entire period of time, in excess of 2 years, that he seeks to toll the deadline for filing the motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000); Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) (alien must demonstrate due diligence during the entire period he or she seeks to toll, which includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed). The respondent did not hire a new attorney and file the current motion to reopen for more than 2 years after he repeatedly tried to reach his prior attorneys with no response from them. See Respondent’s July 27, 2016, Motion to Reopen at Attachments A and B.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George A. Terezakis, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)] - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(E)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i)] - Convicted of crime of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)] - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; waiver of inadmissibility; adjustment of status; continuance; voluntary departure
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 1, 2016, decision ordering him removed from the United States. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
The Immigration Judge has not prepared a separate oral or written decision. Instead, despite the respondent’s denials, the Immigration Judge summarily concluded during the proceedings that the respondent is removable as charged (Tr. at 10-12). The Immigration Judge also decided issues ranging from the merits of a motion to terminate, the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status, the request for a continuance, and the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure during the proceedings and without providing any factual and/or legal analyses to support her decisions. Her findings on these issues are scattered throughout the record. We find that a separate oral or written decision is necessary in this case. See Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999); Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994).
 
In particular, we note that, prior to the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016), which provides the framework for the analyses necessary to determine the respondent’s removability as charged. Further, the Board decided Matter of Silva-Trevino III, 26 I&N Dec. 826 (BIA 2016), regarding the proper framework for determining whether a conviction is for a crime involving moral turpitude, which also affects the respondent’s removability as charged. Additionally, without any explanations of the Immigration Judge’s findings on the issues of, inter alia, termination, adjustment of status, continuances, and voluntary departure, we cannot properly address the respondent’s appellate arguments. This case does not represent one in which a summarily issued decision should be issued as it is inadequate given the complexity of the issues raised and the applications submitted.
 
*2 Upon remand, the Immigration Judge should apply the correct standards to the respondent’s removability based on his convictions and provide explanations for her findings on the various forms of relief and applications in this case. The Immigration Judge should also consider the arguments raised by the respondent on appeal regarding, inter alia, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, the Immigration Judge should prepare and issue a separate written decision setting forth her decision and the legal and factual analyses supporting that decision.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lori B. Schoenberg, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on April 28, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s December 12, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 19, 2016, decision denying his third motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In our April 28, 2014, decision, we found the respondent is collaterally estopped from seeking to relitigate both his lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel arguments which were raised in his first motion and resolved against him in a final order from which no appeal was taken. See Amrollah v. Napolitano, 710 F.3d 568, 571 (5th Cir. 2013) (“A final decision by an immigration judge has a preclusive effect on future litigation and agency decisions.”). We further found that, because these issues have been finally resolved against him, the respondent’s in absentia removal order can be rescinded and proceedings reopened only “upon a motion filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal [he] demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances” beyond his control. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) and 1229a(e)(1). Because the respondent’s motion was filed more than 4 years after his in absentia order was entered, we found it to be untimely, and we dismissed his appeal.
 
On November 16, 2016, the respondent filed a third untimely motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order with the Immigration Judge. In his decision, the Immigration Judge noted again that the respondent is collaterally estopped from relitigating both his lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which he seeks to do in his current motion (I.J. at 1). See Amrollah v. Napolitano, supra. The Immigration Judge also found that even if the respondent’s current motion is not number-barred and subject to collateral estoppel, he did not establish he has been pursuing his rights diligently and/or some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way preventing him from timely filing such that the deadline should be equitably tolled (I.J. at 2). See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016). As to the respondent’s claim that he has previously unavailable evidence to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the Immigration Judge noted that the evidence could have and should have been submitted with the respondent’s first motion (I.J. at 2). Therefore, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion.
 
*2 An in absentia order may be rescinded only if: (1) a motion to reopen is filed within 180 days of the date of the final order and the alien demonstrates there were exceptional circumstances excusing his failure to appear; or (2) a motion to reopen is filed at any time and the alien can demonstrate that failure to appear was due to a lack of proper notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (2017). As we found in our previous decision, the respondent is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues of lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel. See Amrollah v. Napolitano, supra. Further, the respondent’s current motion is both time and number-barred.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s appellate assertions, the Immigration Judge did consider the issue of whether the motions deadline should be equitably tolled (I.J. at 2). See Mata v. Lynch, 135 S.Ct. 2150 (2015). In Lugo-Resendez, the Fifth Circuit instructed that the Board to should determine whether the respondent established: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing, such that equitable tolling applies. See id. (internal citations omitted). The first element requires the respondent to establish he pursued his rights with “reasonable diligence,” not “maximum feasible diligence.” See id. (internal citations omitted). The second element requires the respondent to establish an “extraordinary circumstance beyond his control” prevented him from complying with the applicable deadline. See id. (internal citations omitted). The Fifth Circuit also directed that we must consider the individual facts and circumstances of each case in determining whether equitable tolling is appropriate. See id. at 344-45 (internal citations omitted).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that, based on the facts in this case, the respondent has not shown the required due diligence (I.J. at 2). See id. Specifically, the respondent has not shown he has been pursuing his rights diligently or that some extraordinary circumstance prevented him from timely filing. See id. The respondent was first ordered removed in January 2010 and was thereafter detained in November 2012, but he did not follow-up with his prior counsel, whom he now makes ineffective assistance of counsel claims against, during that period of time (I.J. at 2). It was only after the respondent was detained in 2012 that he took significant action (I.J. at 2). Further, the respondent did not file the instant motion until 2 years after his petition for review was summarily dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (I.J. at 2). See id. The respondent’s arguments on appeal are lengthy but not persuasive. The respondent’s motion is time and number-barred, subject to collateral estoppel pertaining to his lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel arguments, and he has not established that equitable tolling is warranted. See id.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Frederick P.S. Whang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hana A. Sato
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 8, 2016, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal. On December 15, 2016, more than 6 months after the Board’s order, the respondents filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondents’ motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondents argue, however, that their proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Steve Martin, who represented the lead respondent1 in 2005 for his adjustment of status application before the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and who also represented the respondents during parts of these removal proceedings.
 
Specifically, the respondents argue that attorney Martin provided ineffective assistance because: (1) after the respondent retained him in September 2005 for the respondent’s adjustment of status application before the USCIS, he failed to advise the respondent that he should renew his employment authorization, which caused the respondent to continue in an unauthorized employment after his employment authorization expired in November 2006, which in turn resulted in the denial of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status by the USCIS; (2) after the Board dismissed the respondents’ appeal on June 8, 2016, he failed to advise the respondents that they could file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit within 30 days of the Board’s decision; and (3) he relocated his law office from the State of Washington to the State of Kansas in or about 2014, and did not notify the respondents of his move (Motion, at 4-7). The respondents submitted the respondent’s statement, communications among their various attorneys, and documents showing that they complied with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), with respect to attorney Martin (Motion Exhs. A-B). We will address the respondents’ arguments in turn.
 
First, as to attorney Martin’s failure to advise the respondent to renew his employment authorization with the USCIS in or about 2006, this was a matter that occurred outside these removal proceedings, and indeed before these removal proceedings were initiated in 2008. As noted by the Ninth Circuit, the extent to which aliens are entitled to effective assistance of counsel during deportation or removal proceedings is governed by the Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair hearing. Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004), amended sub nom. Lara-Torres v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005). To establish a due process violation, aliens must show, inter alia, the alleged ineffective assistance rendered “the proceeding . . . so fundamentally unfair that [they were] prevented from reasonably presenting [their] case.” Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra (emphasis added); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 894-97 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
*2 In Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, the Ninth Circuit noted that the purported deficiencies of the attorney’s representation in that case did not “““pertain to the actual substance of the hearing (e.g., evidence presented or omitted, arguments raised or overlooked), let alone call the hearing’s fairness into question.” Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra. Rather, the substance of the aliens’ claim was that, had it not been for their reliance on the attorney’s defective immigration law advice, they would not have been subject to removal proceedings at all. Id. This “unfairness,” however, did not taint the “““fairness” of the hearing. Id. The Ninth Circuit also noted that “[w]hen we have characterized counsel’s assistance as ineffective, . . . the legal services were rendered while proceedings were ongoing; that is, after a charging document was filed.” Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra, at 974 (emphases original). To the extent the respondents’ ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Martin relates to his failure to provide correct advice to the respondent in 2005 or 2006, and such failure did not affect the fairness of these removal proceedings initiated in 2008. Therefore, the respondents have not shown that a reopening of their removal proceedings is warranted based on the ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In addition, the claimed ineffective assistance by attorney Martin in 2005 or 2006 long predated the respondent’s previous hearing in 2012. Therefore, these are not “new facts” supported by “new evidence” that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. Section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Furthermore, the respondents have been represented by different attorneys during the course of these proceedings. After the Immigration Judge ordered the respondents removed on September 23, 2009, the respondents were represented by attorney Michael Piston on appeal and in their motion to reconsider filed in 2011. After the Board granted the motion and remanded the proceedings to the Immigration Judge in 2012, the respondents were again represented by attorney Martin before the Immigration Judge at their October 16, 2012, hearing. However, on their second appeal, the respondents were represented by attorney Michele Redburn, who appears to have been associated with attorney Piston’s law practice. The respondent has not explained why attorney Piston or attorney Redburn could not make the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Martin. If and to the extent attorney Piston and/or attorney Redburn provided ineffective assistance by failing to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Martin, the respondents have not made valid ineffective assistance of counsel claims against these attorneys by satisfying the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and they have not explained why they could not do so.
 
*3 Next, as to the respondents’ claim that attorney Martin did not advise them about the Board’s June 8, 2016, decision dismissing their appeal or the possibility of filing a timely petition for review with the Ninth Circuit, as noted above the respondents were represented by attorney Redburn, not attorney Martin, on appeal. Despite the respondents’ argument in the motion and again in their Response to the DHS Opposition to their motion, the respondent admits that he was aware that another attorney was representing the respondents on appeal in 2012 (Motion Exh. A, at 14). Furthermore, although the respondent states that in November 2012 he paid a fee of at least $800 to attorney Martin for his appeal to the Board and considered attorney Martin as his “primary attorney,” the documents submitted show that the respondent made a check of $860 to attorney Piston (Motion Exh. A, at 14, 20), and it was attorney Redburn who represented him on appeal. Despite the respondent’s statement that neither attorney Martin nor attorney Piston contacted him regarding the Board’s June 8, 2016, decision, the documents submitted with the motion do not show what arrangement, if any, was in existence regarding the communication to the respondent following the Board’s decision (Motion Exh. A, at 14). The respondents, as noted above, have not made an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Redburn, nor did they explain why they cannot do so.
 
In any event, the respondent admits that he did receive a courtesy copy of the Board’s decision on his second appeal in June 2016 (Motion Exh. A, at 14). The cover letter to the courtesy copy received by the respondents, a copy of which was submitted with the motion, clearly informed the respondents that, if the attached decision orders that the respondents be removed or affirms an Immigration Judge’s decision ordering them be removed, “any petition for review of the attached decision must be filed with and received by the appropriate court of appeals within 30 days of the date of the decision” (Motion Exh. B. at 30). The respondent admits that he was aware that he could file a review of the Board’s decision in the event the Board dismissed his appeal, because he and attorney Martin had discussed the possibility of a dismissal by the Board and what the next step would be (Motion, at 14).2 Finally, despite the respondents’ assertion that attorney Martin moved his office to Kansas without informing them (Motion, at 7), the respondent’s statement does not show what difficulty, if any, he had in contacting attorney Martin or any other attorney as a result of that move (Motion Exh. A, at 13-14). Rather, the respondent’s statement shows that he only waited for attorney Martin to contact him (Motion Exh. A, at 14), until he received a call-in letter from the DHS in September 2016.
 
Based on the above, the respondents have not shown that their proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Martin. We also decline to reopen the respondents’ proceedings in the exercise of discretion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondents’ motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
*4 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondents are a family of husband, wife, and their two children. The adult male respondent is the lead respondent and principal applicant for relief, and will be referred to as the “respondent” in the singular form in this decision.

2

The respondents’ motion prepared by present counsel states that the respondent was not aware that he could file for further review of the Board’s decision (Motion, at 6-7). However, counsel’s statement in a motion or brief is not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Furthermore, this assertion is contradicted by the respondent’s own statement, as noted above.

File: AXXX XX1 930 - Houston, TX
April 6, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
This case has a lengthy procedural history. On May 17, 2013, an Immigration Judge granted the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).1 In reaching his decision, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not meet his burden to establish that he had been lawfully admitted to the United States in 1993 as she claimed.
 
The respondent appealed, and on August 22, 2014, the Board dismissed the appeal finding that the record did not show that the respondent was admitted as a temporary resident in 1993 as he claimed or paroled into the United States as required by section 245(a) of the Act. We also concluded that even if he was admitted in 1993 as a temporary resident, the record reflected that his temporary resident status expired in 1994. We concluded that when the temporary resident status expired, the respondent’s status reverted to that of an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Our conclusion was based on 8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4), which provides as follows:
Return to unlawful status after termination. Termination of the status of any alien previously adjusted to lawful temporary residence under section 245A(a) of the Act shall act to return such alien to the unlawful status held prior to the adjustment, and render him or her amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings under section 236 or 242 of the Act, as appropriate.
 
8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4).
 
On November 14, 2014, the respondent filed with the Board a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We denied the motion on January 26, 2015.
 
The respondent filed a petition to review our decisions with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises. On April 20, 2016, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Board’s conclusion that the respondent was never lawfully admitted and denied the petition for review. Gomez v. Lynch, 819 F.3d 769 (5th Cir. 2016), superseded by 831 F.3d 652 (5th Cir. 2016).2
 
*2 After that decision, the respondent and the DHS filed with the Fifth Circuit a joint motion to vacate because the DHS located evidence confirming that the respondent had been admitted into the United States in 1993 as the respondent had previously claimed. The Fifth Circuit granted the motion to vacate its April 20, 2016, opinion and accepted briefing from the parties on the interpretation of 8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4).
 
The case is now before the Board pursuant to the Fifth Circuit’s August 5, 2016, remand order. Gomez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 652 (5th Cir. 2016). The court agreed with the respondent that his 1993 admission, which occurred while he held temporary resident status, was not affected by his unlawful status in the United States. Id. at 658, 662.
 
The court reasoned that status and admission are fundamentally different concepts. Id. at 658-60. Citing to Matter of Quinlantan, 25 I&N Dec. 285 (BIA 2010), the court noted that an admission is defined in wholly factual and procedural terms. An alien “who presents himself at an immigration checkpoint, undergoes a procedurally regular inspection, and is given permission to enter the United States has been admitted, regardless of whether he had any underlying legal right to do so.” Id. at 658. The court explained status as the type of permission to be present in the United States. The Fifth Circuit stated that “[because] the concepts are separate, an alien can be admitted despite the absence of any lawful status, as when an immigration officer accidentally processes him through a checkpoint.” Id. at 658-59. Conversely, “an alien who was admitted in a lawful status can acquire unlawful status, as by overstaying a visa - but that does not mean he was never admitted.” Id. at 659.
 
The court also explained that section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) includes the admission/status distinction by providing separate bars to adjustment of status with different exceptions and is addressed in different subsections of the Act. Finally, the court explained that the regulatory language of 8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4) that provides for an alien to return to a previous unlawful status does not undo a factual admission that occurred during the time when the alien was in lawful status. Id. at 662.
 
Thus, although the respondent returned to his previous unlawful status when his temporary resident status expired, his lack of status did not undo his historical, factual admission for purposes of adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act. We conclude that a remand is warranted for the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act. On remand the parties should have the opportunity to update the record regarding the respondent’s application.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s August 22, 2014, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The Immigration Judge issued a prior decision on September 19, 2012, to this effect but the Immigration Judge gave the respondent additional time to identify any other relief for which he may have been eligible. In his May 17, 2013, decision, the Immigration Judge entered his final order granting the DHS’s motion to pretermit (I.J. dated May 17, 2013, at 2).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luther Snavely, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Fair hearing
 
*1 On December 5, 2016, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and granted him voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), in lieu of removal. The respondent waived appeal. On January 4, 2017, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal in which he asserts that his former attorney’s handling of his case deprived him of his right to due process, and he seeks remand to the Immigration Judge to enable him to apply for relief from removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Generally, the decision of an Immigration Judge becomes final immediately upon the waiver of an alien’s right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a case in which the alien has waived the right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The record reveals that the Immigration Judge’s decision was personally served on the respondent and his attorney on December 5, 2016. The respondent has not set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board). Further, the respondent does not claim that the waiver of the appeal was not knowing and voluntary. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322-23 (BIA 2000). Under the circumstances, we will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and return the record to the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Judge.

*1 In a decision dated April 13, 2015, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable under section 237(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i) (alien admitted for permanent residence on a conditions basis whose status was terminated); denied his request for a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B) (From I-751); and denied his application for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 1229c(b).1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision on September 13, 2016. On December 12, 2016, the respondent filed the instant timely motion to reopen the proceedings to enable him to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), based on a pending visa petition filed by his wife, who is United States citizen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not filed an opposition to this motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The evidence offered in support of the motion includes documentation showing that that the respondent and his current wife are the parents of two United States citizen children. Upon consideration, the motion to reopen will be granted.2 See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). Although we have affirmed the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not show that he entered his prior marriage in good faith, we cannot conclude that this automatically bars him from adjustment under section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c).
 
The following orders will be entered.3
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

1

The Immigration Judge denied the application for voluntary departure because the respondent did not accrue at least 1 year of physical presence preceding the service of the Notice to Appear (I.J. at 21).

2

Inasmuch as the proceedings will be reopened and remanded to the Immigration Judge, we will not, at this time, consider the respondent’s arguments for reopening based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

3

The respondent, whose petition for judicial review of the Board’s prior order is currently pending, is advised to inform the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit of the Board’s decision. See Aharon v. Sessions, No. 16-73249 (9th Cir., filed Oct. 6, 2016).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shirley C. Zambrano, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on January 23, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider this decision on February 22, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent has not advanced any specific argument regarding any error in our prior decision, and we find no error in law or fact, or argument that was overlooked, that would warrant further consideration of his claim. See generally Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent argues that the Board erred in finding that he had not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), but we find no error in this conclusion (Bd. Dec. at 1-2). With his motion, the respondent has now filed various notarized statements as well as evidence that he filed a grievance against his prior attorney with the State Bar of Georgia. Cast as a motion to reopen, the respondent has not adequately demonstrated that such evidence “was not available and could not have been discovered or presented” with his appeal and motion to remand. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, the respondent has presented no additional evidence that would alter our previous conclusion that the respondent has not been prejudiced by any action or inaction by his former counsel (Bd. Dec. at 2). Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984). The additional statements the respondent has now submitted are not a basis for reconsideration or reopening.1
 
Given the above findings, we also find no reason to disturb our previous rejection of the respondent’s due process claim (I.J. at 2). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s or this Board’s reliance on counsel’s indication that the respondent had admitted the allegations and conceded removability (Tr. at 9). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). As such, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We note that although the respondent has asserted that he did not have time to discuss his sexual orientation with counsel and did not know it could be a basis for an asylum claim, he has also stated that he did not disclose the information because he had not told his parents about it.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on January 11, 2017. The appeal was accordingly due on or before February 10, 2017. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on February 21, 2017. The respondent asks that the late appeal be accepted because her prior attorney failed to inform her of the date of the Immigration Judge’s decision and of her right to appeal. However, the respondent provides no details or evidence to support this claim, nor has she made an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
Because we are dismissing the appeal as untimely, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) & (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) & (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) & (B) and (c)(7)(A) & (C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.
