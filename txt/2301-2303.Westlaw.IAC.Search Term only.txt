MATTER OF FEFE
In Exclusion Proceedings
A-28556862
Decided by Board August 1, 1989
**1 (1) An applicant for asylum cannot meet his burden of proof unless he testifies under oath regarding his application; and, therefore, an immigration judge should not proceed to adjudicate a written application for asylum if no oral testimony has been offered in support of that application.
 
(2) At a minimum, the regulations require that an asylum applicant take the stand, be placed under oath, and be questioned as to whether the information in his written application is complete and correct; the examination of an applicant will ordinarily be this brief only where the parties have stipulated that the applicant’s oral testimony would be consistent with his written application and that his testimony would be believably presented.
 
EXCLUDABLE:
Act of 1952—Sec. 212(a)(19) [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(19) ]—Seeks to enter by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
Sec. 212(a)(20) [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(20) ]—No valid immigrant visa

In a decision dated February 17, 1989, the immigration judge denied the applicant’s requests for asylum and withholding of deportation pursuant to sections 208(a) and 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(a) and 1253(h) (1982), and ordered that the applicant be excluded and deported from the United States. The applicant appealed. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The applicant is a 24–year–old native and citizen of Haiti. He arrived in the United States on November 5, 1988. The Immigration and Naturalization Service then initiated exclusion proceedings against the applicant by issuing a Notice to Applicant for Admission Detained for Hearing before Immigration Judge (Form I–122) which *117 alleged that the applicant was inadmissible to the United States pursuant to sections 212(a)(19) and (20) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182 (a)(19) and (20) (1982).
 
At his exclusion hearing, the applicant did not contest his excludability, but he requested asylum. He completed a Request for Asylum in the United States (Form I–589), including a two-page, typewritten addendum providing details concerning his fear of persecution in Haiti, which was forwarded to the Department of State Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs for an advisory opinion. See 8 C.F.R. § 236.3(a)(1) (1988).
 
The applicant appeared with counsel for the hearing on the merits of his asylum application. Applicant’s counsel stated that because “the I–589 [is] such an extensive story in itself, we’ll just rest on that.” The Service attorney also declined to ask the applicant any questions concerning his written asylum request, stating that he was “not going to cross examine.” In a closing statement, the Service attorney raised various questions regarding the nature of the information provided in the applicant’s affidavit. The immigration judge then entered his decision denying the applicant’s requests for asylum and withholding of deportation. In his decision, the immigration judge reviewed the applicant’s written testimony but described his statements as “self-serving.” The immigration judge also noted that the applicant had offered no corroboration for his Form I–589, and he stated that “[w]e don’t know whether his story is true or not.”
 
**2 On appeal, the applicant contends that the immigration judge erred in denying his applications for asylum and withholding of deportation.1 We find that the record should be remanded because the immigration judge has not complied with the regulations concerning asylum hearings.
 
The regulations regarding the procedure for adjudication of asylum applications provide at 8 C.F.R. § 208.6 (1988) that an “applicant shall be examined in person by an immigration officer or judge prior to the adjudication of the asylum application.” The regulations further provide at 8 C.F.R. § 236.3(a)(2) (1988) that when an applicant requests asylum in exclusion proceedings, he “shall be examined under oath on his application and may present evidence on his behalf.” See also 8 C.F.R. § 242.17(c) (1988). In Matter of Balibundi, Interim Decision 3053 (BIA 1988), we held that in light of the requirement that an asylum applicant must be examined under oath, an immigration judge *118 should not adjudicate an asylum application where an applicant fails to appear for a hearing.
 
At a minimum, we find that the regulations require that an applicant for asylum and withholding take the stand, be placed under oath, and be questioned as to whether the information in the written application is complete and correct. We would not anticipate that the examination would stop at this point unless the parties stipulate that the applicant’s testimony would be entirely consistent with the written materials and that the oral statement would be believably presented.
 
In the ordinary course, however, we consider the full examination of an applicant to be an essential aspect of the asylum adjudication process for reasons related to fairness to the parties and to the integrity of the asylum process itself. We note that there are often significant differences (either discrepancies or meaningful omissions) between the written and oral statements in an asylum application; these differences cannot be ascertained unless an applicant is subjected to direct examination. Moreover, if an applicant is not fully examined under oath there would seldom be a means of detecting those unfortunate instances in which an asylum claim is fabricated. On the other hand, there are cases where an alien establishes eligibility for asylum by means of his oral testimony when such eligibility would not have been established by the documents alone.
 
We stated in Matter of Mogharrabi, Interim Decision 3028, at 10 (BIA 1987), that an alien can demonstrate eligibility for asylum where his “testimony is believable, consistent, and sufficiently detailed to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis for his fear.” It is difficult for an alien to satisfy this standard unless he presents testimony at his hearing which is consistent with and corroborates any previous written statements in his Form I–589. See Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status Under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees para. 199–200 at 47–48 (Geneva, 1979). Accordingly, in cases such as the instant one, where the alien’s counsel seeks to “rest” his case on a completed Form I–589 and the parties have not entered into a stipulation regarding the contents of the Form I–589, the immigration judge should inform counsel that an alien cannot meet his burden of proof unless he testifies under oath regarding his application. The immigration judge in some cases, for example where an alien is not represented, may wish to question the alien concerning the completed Form I–589. The immigration judge should not, however, proceed to adjudicate a written application for asylum if no oral testimony has been offered in support of that application. See Matter of Balibundi, supra.
 
**3 *119 Because the immigration judge here did adjudicate the respondent’s asylum application based solely on written statements in the Form I–589, and because this is not a case where there is agreement that the applicant’s written statement is believable and that the applicant could have presented oral testimony consistent with that statement, the record will be remanded to the immigration judge for further proceedings in light of this opinion.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the immigration judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

The applicant’s current counsel also contends that the applicant received ineffective assistance of counsel at his exclusion hearing. Because the record will be remanded for a hearing de novo, we need not address this argument.

MATTER OF LOZADA
In Deportation Proceedings
A-31025184
Decided by Board April 13, 1988
**1 *637 (1) A motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
(2) An alien deportable under section 241(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(4) (1982), is ineligible for voluntary departure unless he qualifies under the provisions of section 244(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1554(a)(2) (1982), which in the case of criminal offenders requires, inter alia, that the alien have been physically present in the United States and a person of good moral character for a continuous period of not less than 10 years following the date of his conviction.

On March 13, 1985, an immigration judge found the respondent deportable as charged on the basis of his concessions at the hearing under section 241(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(4) (1982), as an alien who was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within 5 years of entry and *638 was sentenced to confinement for 1 year or more, denied his applications for relief under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1982), and for voluntary departure under section 244(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(e) (1982), and ordered him deported to the Dominican Republic. That same day, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form I–290A), indicating that he would be filing a separate written brief or statement in support of his appeal. No such brief or statement was forthcoming. On July 8, 1986, over a year after the immigration judge had entered his decision in the case, the Board summarily dismissed the appeal, noting that the respondent had in no meaningful manner identified the claimed error in the immigration judge’s comprehensive decision of March 13, 1985.
 
On January 20, 1987, the respondent, through present counsel,1 filed a motion to reopen the proceedings, alleging (1) that prior counsel’s failure to submit a written brief or statement explaining the basis for appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and (2) that the immigration judge erred as a matter of law and discretion in deciding the case. The respondent also filed a petition for review of the Board’s decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The court has stayed action on the petition for review pending the Board’s resolution of the motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
**2 Any right a respondent in deportation proceedings may have to counsel is grounded in the fifth amendment guarantee of due process. Magallanes—Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194 (5th Cir. 1975). Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. Ramirez—Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1986); Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1985); see also Magallanes—Damian v. INS, supra (alien must show not merely ineffective assistance of counsel, but assistance which is so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause). One must show, moreover, that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249 (9th Cir. 1986). See generally Matter of Santos, Interim Decision 2969 (BIA 1984).
 
The Government maintains that the fact that prior counsel did not submit a brief does not in itself amount to deprivation of due process. We agree.
 
*639 Failure to specify reasons for an appeal is grounds for summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(d)(1–a)(i) (1988). See generally Matter of Valencia, Interim Decision 3006 (BIA 1986). It would be anomalous to hold that the same action or, more accurately, inaction that gives rise to a summary dismissal of an appeal could, without more, serve as the basis of a motion to reopen. To allow such anomaly would permit an alien to circumvent at will the appeals process, with its regulatory time constraints, by the simple expedient of failing to properly pursue his appeal rights, then claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, absent egregious circumstances. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st Cir. 1983). No such egregious circumstances have been established in this case.
 
A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts. In the case before us, that affidavit should include a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken on appeal and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard. Furthermore, before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond, should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.
 
**3 The high standard announced here is necessary if we are to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before the Board. Where essential information is lacking, it is impossible to evaluate the substance of such claim. In the instant case, for example, the respondent has not alleged, let alone established, that former counsel ever agreed to prepare a brief on appeal or was engaged to undertake the task. Then, too, the potential for abuse is apparent where no mechanism exists for allowing former counsel, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, to present his version of events if he so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations. The requirement that disciplinary authorities be notified of breaches of professional conduct not only serves to deter meritless claims of ineffective representation but also highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings, *640 the outcome of which may, and often does, have enormous significance for the person.
 
The respondent’s motion is wholly insufficient in light of the foregoing guidelines. We note, moreover, that no prejudice was shown to have resulted from prior counsel’s failure to or decision not to file a brief in support of the appeal. The respondent received a full and fair hearing at which he was given every opportunity to present his case. We do not find, and the respondent does not allege, any inadequacy in the quality of prior counsel’s representation at the hearing. The immigration judge considered and properly evaluated all the evidence presented, and his conclusions that the respondent did not merit a grant of section 212(c) relief as a matter of discretion and that he was ineligible for voluntary departure as a matter of law are supported by the record.
 
The allegations of error ascribed to the immigration judge in the respondent’s motion are unfounded. Contrary to present counsel’s contention, it is clear from the transcript of hearing and the immigration judge’s decision that the immigration judge was well aware that the respondent committed the offense of obtaining money under false pretenses several years prior to his conviction of that offense. And contrary to counsel’s contention, the immigration judge correctly determined that the respondent was not eligible for a grant of voluntary departure. By the express terms of section 244(e) of the Act, an alien deportable under section 241(a)(4) of the Act is ineligible for voluntary departure unless he qualifies under the provisions of section 244(a)(2) of the Act, which in the case of criminal offenders requires, inter alia, that the alien have been physically present in this country, and a person of good moral character, for a continuous period of not less than 10 years following his conviction. See generally Matter of P—, 6 I&N Dec. 788 (BIA 1955). The 10-year period is measured from the date of conviction, not the date the offense was committed, since it is the conviction, not the commission of the offense, that renders the alien deportable. Id. Since 10 years from the date of the conviction constituting the ground of deportation have not yet elapsed, the respondent is unable to demonstrate statutory eligibility for voluntary departure.
 
**4 The respondent has shown no basis for reopening or reconsideration. His motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

CHARGE:
ORDER: Act of 1982—Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)]—Nonimmigrant—remained longer than permitted

ON BEHALF OF SERVICE:
David B. Hopkins
General Attorney
BY: Milhollan, Chairman; Maniatis, Dunne, Morris, and Vacca, Board Members
The respondent has appealed from the December 30, 1982 summary decision of an immigration judge finding him deportable as an overstay pursuant to section 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a 48-year-old male native and citizen of the Philippines. He entered the United States at San Francisco, California, on June 2, 1982, as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure who was authorized to remain in this country until August 30, 1982. He failed to depart by that date. On November 16, 1982, prior to the institution of deportation proceedings, the Immigration and Naturalization *106 Service granted the respondent the privilege of departing voluntarily from the United States before December 15, 1982. He again failed to depart within the time allotted. On December 27, 1982, the Service arrested the respondent in Anchorage, Alaska, and commenced deportation proceedings against him by issuing an Order to Show Cause charging him with deportability pursuant to section 241(a)(2) of the Act for remaining in the United States longer than permitted.
 
A deportation hearing was convened before the immigration judge 1 day later, on December 28, 1982. At that hearing the respondent requested an opportunity to secure counsel and was granted a continuance of 1 day to do so. At the reconvened hearing on December 29, 1982, the respondent, who had been unable to retain an attorney, waived his right to counsel and, testifying in response to questions put to him by the immigration judge, admitted the factual allegations in the Order to Show Cause. In a summary decision the immigration judge found the respondent deportable as charged on the basis of his admissions. Upon ascertaining that the respondent wished to depart voluntarily instead of being deported, the immigration judge granted the respondent voluntary departure until December 30, 1982, or any extension beyond that date that may be granted by the District Director. The respondent waived his right to appeal the immigration judge’s decision.
 
**2 On January 3, 1983, the respondent, with the assistance of counsel, filed this appeal. He contests the legality of his waivers of counsel and of appeal, challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of deportability, and contends that the Service and the immigration judge violated not only various regulations, but the fifth amendment’s guarantee of due process. We shall assume jurisdiction over the case by certification as provided in 8 C.F.R. 3.1(c), thus mooting the issue of whether the respondent effectively waived his right to appeal.
 
As a preliminary matter, we will address the respondent’s argument that the evidence in the case is insufficient to support the finding of deportability. When an alien is charged with being deportable as an overstay pursuant to section 241(a)(2) of the Act, there must be ‘clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence,’ Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966), that the alien was admitted as a nonimmigrant for a temporary period, that the period elapsed, and that he did not depart. Tsao v. INS, 538 F.2d 667, 668 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 906 (1977); Milande v. INS, 484 F.2d 774, 776 (7th Cir. 1973); see also Torabpour v. INS, 694 F.2d 1119, 1122 (8th Cir. 1982); *107 Cabuco—Flores v. INS, 477 F.2d 108, 110 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 841 (1973). The respondent freely admitted, under oath, that he entered the United States as a nonimmigrant, that he was authorized to remain until August 30, 1982, that he received an extension until December 15, 1982, and that he did not depart by that date. These admissions are clear, unequivocal, and convincing and prove each of the elements of the charge of deportability. See, e.g., Milande v. INS, supra. Thus, we find them wholly sufficient to support the order of deportation.
 
The respondent contends that we should reverse the order of deportation because his right to counsel was violated at his deportation hearing, thereby denying him due process. Specifically, the respondent argues that he was not given an adequate opportunity to obtain counsel and that he did not effectively waive his right to counsel once the hearing commenced. We do not believe the respondent was denied the privilege of counsel at his hearing. The immigration judge granted the respondent’s request for a continuance so that he could have an opportunity to obtain counsel and, at the reconvened hearing, the respondent did not request more time to seek counsel or indicate he still wished to secure representation. See Millan—Garcia v. INS, 343 F.2d 825, 829 (9th Cir.), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 382 U.S. 69 (1965). In addition, the respondent’s waiver of counsel appears to have been voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. There is no indication, whatsoever, that he waived counsel because of undue Government influence, nor do his statements at the time of the waiver reveal any confusion about the nature of the proceedings, his privilege of being represented, or his rights to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and object to the Government’s evidence. See Burquez v. INS, 513 F.2d 751, 755 (10th Cir. 1975); Matter of Gutierrez, 16 I&N Dec. 226 (BIA 1977). Moreover, the immigration judge sufficiently informed the respondent of his privilege of counsel. See United States v. Barraza—Leon, 575 F.2d 218, 222 (9th Cir. 1978); Matter of Gutierrez, supra.
 
**3 Nevertheless, even if the respondent was not given sufficient time to obtain counsel or did not effectively waive counsel, it does not automatically follow that he has been denied constitutional due process. We have held an alien must demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by a violation of a procedural rule or regulation before his deportation proceeding will be invalidated. Matter of Garcia—Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325, 329 (BIA 1980). This is consistent with the rule that an alien must have been prejudiced by a procedural defect in his deportation proceeding before he will be found to have suffered a denial of due process. See  *108 Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981); United States v. Calles—Pineda, 627 F.2d 976, 977–78 (9th Cir. 1980); Tejeda—Mata v. INS, 626 F.2d 721, 727 (9th Cir. 1980),  cert. denied, 456 U.S. 994 (1982); see also United States v. Vega—Mejia, 611 F.2d 751, 752 (9th Cir. 1979); Garcia—Jaramillo v. INS, 604 F.2d 1236, 1238–39 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 828 (1980); Bowe v. INS, 597 F.2d 1158 (9th Cir. 1979); Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802, 808–10 (9th Cir. 1979);  United States v. Barraza—Leon, supra, at 221; Orozco—Rangel v. INS, 528 F.2d 224 (9th Cir. 1976); Chung Young Chew v. Boyd, 309 F.2d 857, 864–65 (9th Cir. 1962). We consider this rule to apply with equal force to the contention that an alien has been denied due process in his deportation proceeding because of conduct that amounts to a violation of his right to counsel.
 
The ‘right’ to counsel does not arise by operation of the sixth amendment, for deportation proceedings are not criminal prosecutions. Ramirez v. INS, 550 F.2d 560, 563 (9th Cir. 1977); Martin—Mendoza v. INS, 499 F.2d 918, 922 (9th Cir. 1974); Murgia—Melendrez v. INS, 407 F.2d 207, 209 (9th Cir. 1969). Rather, this ‘right’ is the opportunity, created by the Act and the regulations, of being represented by qualified counsel of choice, at no expense to the Government. See, e.g., Ramirez v. INS, supra; see also sections 242(b) and 292 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252(b) and 1362; 8 C.F.R. 242.10. An erroneous violation of this statutory privilege is not, as a matter of law, so egregious or inherently unfair that it amounts to a per se denial of due process. For example, the ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding does not amount to a denial of due process unless it has been unfair or has prevented an alien from reasonably presenting his case. Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365, 1367 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, —— U.S. ——, 52 U.S.L.W. 3844 (U.S. May 21, 1984); Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194, 199 (5th Cir. 1975). Similarly, the absence of counsel at a deportation hearing does not constitute a denial of due process without some showing of prejudice to the alien. Ramirez v. INS, supra, at 562, 565; Aguilera—Enriquez v. INS, 516 F.2d 565, 569 (6th Cir. 1975); Burquez v. INS, supra, at 755; Martin—Mendoza v. INS, supra, at 922; Villaneuva—Jurado v. INS, 482 F.2d 886, 888 (5th Cir. 1973); Henriques v. INS, 465 F.2d 119, 120–21 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 968 (1973); Madokoro v. Del Guercio, 160 F.2d 164, 167 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 764 (1947); Matter of Escobar, Interim Decision 2944 (BIA 1983). The Supreme Court has recently acknowledged that even violations of the right to counsel in criminal proceedings may be disregarded as harmless error in appropriate cases. United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 365 (1981); see also Moore v. Illinois, 434 U.S. 220, 232 (1977). If this is the rule in criminal proceedings where the right to *109 counsel is grounded in the specific guarantee of the sixth amendment, it is, a fortiori, the rule in deportation proceedings where the statutory privilege of counsel is grounded in the due process concept of fairness. That concept necessarily includes consideration of the harm or prejudice caused by erroneous conduct.
 
**4 The respondent argues, however, that the privilege of counsel is so fundamental that its violation can never be considered harmless error. This position has been accepted by the United States Courts of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and the District of Columbia (‘D.C.’) Circuit, both of which have held that a violation of the privilege of counsel in deportation proceedings is inherently prejudicial and is not subject to the harmless error doctrine. Castaneda—Delgado v. INS, 525 F.2d 1295 (7th Cir. 1975); Yiu Fong Cheung v. INS, 418 F.2d 460 (D.C. Cir. 1969). These courts, which relied exclusively on decisions in criminal cases to support their position, did not address the distinction between deportation proceedings and criminal trials. See, e.g., Woodby v. INS, supra, at 285–86; Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 594 (1952). Moreover, these courts based their decisions upon the premise, rejected in United States v. Morrison, supra, and Moore v. Illinois, supra, that violations of the right to counsel may never be considered harmless, even where no prejudice ensues. For these reasons, we decline to follow the position of the Seventh and the D.C. Circuits outside of those circuits. Since the respondent’s case arises in the Ninth Circuit, we hold that a deprivation of counsel does not amount to a denial of due process so long as it was harmless error, i.e., so long as it was not unfair or did not demonstrably prejudice the respondent.1
 
At the deportation hearing the respondent readily admitted the facts which make him deportable as charged. He has not denied those facts nor has he challenged the legality of his admissions.2 In *110 the appellate stage of these proceedings the respondent has received the assistance of counsel in presenting his procedural objections to the order of deportation. Counsel has not advanced any arguments which refute the finding of deportability nor has he shown that the respondent was eligible for any form of discretionary relief from deportation other than that which he received, voluntary departure. Thus, this is a case in which the operative facts are undisputed, deportability is clear, and the respondent has been given a fair opportunity to challenge the deportation order on appeal and has failed to show how the presence of counsel would have changed the outcome. Under these circumstances, any erroneous violation of the privilege of counsel that may have occurred was neither unfair nor prejudicial to the respondent and therefore did not amount to a denial of due process requiring a new hearing.  See Henriques v. INS, supra, at 121.
 
The respondent has also raised a number of other procedural objections to his deportation hearing. Several of these objections are frivolous. The objection that the respondent was neither provided with nor given an opportunity to secure an interpreter ignores the fact that there was no apparent need for an interpreter because the respondent did not request one and appeared to understand and speak English well. The objection that the respondent was not advised that his statements might be used against him, in violation of 8 C.F.R. 242.1(c) and 242.2(a), is unsupported by the record. The regulations cited pertain to advice an alien is to receive before a deportation hearing commences, either upon service of an Order to Show Cause or upon arrest, and the record contains no information whatsoever about the Service’s conduct at this point in the proceedings. Moreover, once the respondent was placed under oath at his deportation hearing, he had no right to remain silent to nonincriminating questions, see supra note 2, and he was under an obligation to answer any questions truthfully or suffer the adverse inferences that could be drawn from his silence. United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner, 273 U.S. 103, 110 (1927); United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149, 154 (1923); Chavez—Raya v. INS, 519 F.2d 397, 401 (7th Cir. 1975). The objection that the Order to Show Cause provided insufficient notice of the charges against the respondent and required an explanation is wholly without merit. The Order to Show Cause fully complied with the notice *111 requirements of the regulations: it contained a recitation of the legal authority under which the deportation proceedings would be conducted, a statement of the facts which made the respondent’s conduct unlawful, and a designation of the charges against the respondent and the statutory provisions he violated. 8 C.F.R. 242.1(b). The respondent made no request to be provided with an explanation of the Order to Show Cause nor did he express any uncertainty when he admitted each of the allegations.
 
**5 The respondent has also argued that the Service’s regulations were violated, thereby denying him due process, because he was not advised of the availability of a free legal services program. The regulations require an immigration judge at the opening of a deportation hearing to advise an alien of the availability of such programs and to ascertain whether the alien has received a list of them. 8 C.F.R. 242.16(a). It appears from the record that the immigration judge did not advice the respondent of the availability of such programs at the opening of his hearing. Nonetheless, the immigration judge was also to ascertain that the respondent had already been informed of the availability of a free legal services program: the immigration judge had before him, as an exhibit, the Order to Show Cause which had been served upon the respondent and to which was attached a Written Notice of Appeal Rights (Form I–618) informing the respondent of the existence and address of Legal Aid. Under these circumstances, it is clear that the respondent was given notice, before his deportation hearing, of the availability of a free legal services program and thus was not prejudiced by the immigration judge’s failure to advise him of that program at the start of the hearing. Since the immigration judge’s failure to comply fully with 8 C.F.R. 242.16(a) was a procedural defect which did not prejudice the respondent, it did not amount to a violation of due process. See Tejeda—Mata v. INS, supra, at 727; Ka Fung Chan v. INS, supra, at 258.
 
The respondent’s final procedural objection is that he was not given sufficient notice of his deportation hearing, in violation of 8 C.F.R. 242.1(b) and the requirements of due process. The regulation cited by the respondent provides that an alien shall be notified of the time and place of his deportation hearing not less than 7 days before the hearing date, unless the Service believes that the public interest, safety, or security requires shorter notice, or unless the alien requests shorter notice. 8 C.F.R. 242.1(b). The Service complied fully with this regulation in the respondent’s case because the District Director found the public interest required the respondent to undergo an immediate hearing and issued a written notification to that effect.
 
*112 Moreover, the District Director’s decision to issue the notice appears to have been reasonable. Both of the parties’ briefs on appeal agree that the respondent’s deportation hearing was held without the standard 7 days’ notice because Alaska did not have a full-time immigration judge at the time of the respondent’s arrest; rather, an immigration judge traveled from Seattle, Washington, to spend a few days in Anchorage, Alaska, on a quarterly visit to the city. The Service has argued that the District Director believed it to be in the public interest to schedule an immediate hearing because the respondent was unable to raise money for bond and the Service was faced with the dilemma of holding a hearing on short notice, or keeping the respondent in detention, at public expense, until the immigration judge returned to Alaska. It was not unreasonable for the District Director to conclude that it would be in the public interest to avoid the costs of detaining the respondent at public expense until the immigration judge returned to Anchorage, for this is a time in which our nation is faced not only with immigration costs that are rising at an alarming rate but also with a staggering federal budget deficit. See generally, Lopez—Mendoza v. INS, 705 F.2d 1059, 1091–92 (9th Cir. 1983) (Alarcon, J., Wright, J., Wallace, J., and Poole, J., dissenting). Nor was it unreasonable for the respondent to be required to face a deportation hearing on short notice: the charge that he was deportable as an overstay was capable of resolution by the mere fact of his presence in this country beyond his authorized time and was not subject to any defenses which would require expertise in immigration law. In addition, the respondent had the opportunity, which he exercised, of seeking a continuance of his hearing. See 8 C.F.R. 242.13.
 
**6 The respondent has received all of the basic prerequisites of a fundamentally fair hearing: he was notified of the charge against him 2 days before he chose to proceed with his hearing; he was given the opportunities to retain counsel, to be heard, and to produce evidence and witnesses to refute the evidence against him; and his case was decided by an unbiased immigration judge and by the Board based upon substantial evidence of record. See Whitfield v. Hanges, 222 F. 745 (8th Cir. 1915). Thus, inasmuch as none of the alleged procedural defects, individually or in the aggregate, affected the outcome of the respondent’s case or the validity of the deportation order, we cannot agree that he has been denied constitutional due process. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We note that the respondent has contested the immigration judge’s grant of voluntary departure. We need not decide whether it was reasonable for the immigration judge to grant the respondent one day to arrange his departure inasmuch as he has now been *113 able to extend his time in this country by virtue of this appeal. See 8 C.F.R. 3.6(a). Generally, when we dismiss an alien’s appeal, we reinstate the immigration judge’s grant of voluntary departure if that grant is less than 30 days. Matter of Chouliaris, 16 I&N Dec. 168 (BIA 1977). In the respondent’s case, however, we will modify the immigration judge’s order and grant the respondent 15 days for voluntary departure in order to give him more time to prepare for departure.3
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: In lieu of deportation, the respondent is permitted to depart voluntarily from the country without expense to the Government within 15 days from the date of this order, or any extension beyond that date as may be granted by the District Director and under such conditions as he may direct. In the event of failure so to depart, the respondent shall be deported as provided in the immigration judge’s order.

Our holding is distinguishable from the decision in Castro—Nuno v. INS, 577 F.2d 577 (9th Cir. 1978), in which the Ninth Circuit reversed an order of deportation when an immigration judge failed to continue an alien’s deportation hearing until such time as counsel retained by the alien could be present. In that case, the Ninth Circuit held that the immigration judge had denied and alien his statutory privilege of counsel and thereby had committed a reversible abuse of discretion. Id. at 579. There was no contention in that case, however, that the violation of the privilege of counsel was harmless error. Thus, the Ninth Circuit did not address the issue.

This is not a case in which counsel validly could have advised the respondent that he had a fifth amendment privilege to remain silent in response to the questions about his alienage and his failure to depart within the authorized time. The fifth amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination exists only when a person is asked to testify to incriminatory facts, i.e., facts which could make him the subject to criminal prosecution. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 1147 n.7 (1984); Wall v. INS, 722 F.2d 1442 (9th Cir. 1984); Matter of Carrillo, 17 I&N Dec. 30 (BIA 1979). No crime is implicated when an alien overstays his allotted time. Thus, the facts which the respondent was asked to, and did, admit were nonincriminatory facts and he had no valid basis for asserting a fifth amendment privilege.

The respondent has submitted various letters and documents to us on appeal which attest to the validity of a marriage between him and a woman identified solely as Shirley Santos. It appears from the notice attached to these exhibits that the respondent may be seeking to challenge the District Director’s failure to act upon a visa petition (Form I–130) which he alleges was filed on January 28, 1983. Initial action on such a visa petition is a matter solely within the jurisdiction of the Service, not the Board. See 8 C.F.R. 204.1(a). Since we have no explanation or motion before us regarding these documents and no original jurisdiction to decide matters pertaining to a visa petition, we will return these documents to the attorney for the respondent.
