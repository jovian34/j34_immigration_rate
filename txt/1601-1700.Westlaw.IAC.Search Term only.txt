IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hamza Ma’ayergi, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 28, 2006, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on September 22, 1998. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent failed to appear for his hearing on September 22, 1998, and was ordered removed in absentia. In his motion to reopen, the respondent acknowledges that he departed the United States on November 26, 1999, to visit his mother in Guatemala. Furthermore, he re-entered the United States on March 10, 2002, using another individual’s passport. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, at 2. In a decision dated November 28, 2006, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s departure from the United States in November 1999, was a self-deportation under 8 C.F.R. § 1241.7. Therefore, there are no proceedings to reopen.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge should have exercised his discretion and reopened the proceedings because the respondent established that he failed to appear for his hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. On the notice of appeal, the respondent asserts that the proceedings should be reopened pursuant to Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 462 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2006)(court determined that Immigration Judges and the Board retain jurisdiction to reopen proceedings to address whether an alien received sufficient notice of a removal hearing, subsequent to an alien’s removal from the United States). The respondent also asserts that 8 C.F.R. § 1241.7. violates the respondent’s right to due process. However, it is well settled that this Board lacks jurisdiction to rule upon the constitutionality of the Act. See section 103 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1103; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1; Liu v. Waters, 55 F.3d 421 (9th Cir. 1995); Matter of Fuentes-Campos, 21 I&N Dec. 905 (BIA 1997); Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, at 532 (BIA 1992).
 
We find that the Board and the Immigration Judge lack jurisdiction over a motion to reopen after the respondent’s departure from the United States pursuant to a final order of removal. See Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998). “A motion to reopen or reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” 8 C.F.R.§§ 1003.2(d), 1003.23(b); see also Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864 (BIA 1994) (finding that once the Board’s order of deportation was legally, executed, the proceedings were brought to finality, and the Board lacks jurisdiction to act on a motion to reopen). The respondent avers that his proceedings should be reopened pursuant to Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Attorney Gen., supra. However, the case cited by the respondent was issued in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Consequently, it is inapplicable in the instant proceedings and it has no precedential value. Moreover, the respondent knew that his hearing was scheduled for September 22, 1998. See Exh. 2, Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, at 1. The respondent has not presented any pertinent legal authority to support an assertion that the Immigration Judge and the Board retain jurisdiction to consider a motion to reopen subsequent to an alien’s removal from the United States.1 The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s departure from the United States in November 1999, was a self-deportation under 8 C.F.R. § 1241.7. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

In light of our finding that the Board and the Immigration Judge lack jurisdiction over a motion to reopen aider the respondent’s departure from the United States pursuant to a final order of removal, we decline to address the remaining issues raised on appeal.

IN RE: YOUNG HAE CHUNG
File: AXX XX8 147 - Los Angeles
March 1, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sunmin Lee, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the decision of an Immigration Judge entered on November 16, 2005, decision. The appeal, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded, will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a citizen of the South Korea, was charged with being present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. At a November 16, 2005, hearing, counsel indicated that the respondent desired adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen. The respondent’s motion for administrative closure was denied. At the November 16, 2005, hearing, current counsel sought only voluntary departure under 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) (Tr. at 10). After consultation with the respondent, off the record, counsel confirmed that pre-conclusion voluntary departure was being sought and waived appeal (Tr. at 11-14). See Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000)(grant of voluntary departure prior to completion of removal proceeding, under Section 240B(a) of the Act, requires an express waiver of the right to appeal); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i).
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
The respondent suggests that her waiver was invalid. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). She argues that she received ineffective assistance from her former counsel, that she was told to just say “yes” to everything, and that she did not know that she was waiving the right to appeal or agreeing to depart voluntarily. However, in this case, we note that the respondent was not forced to seek pre-hearing voluntary departure, which requires an appeal waiver. Rather, counsel sought such relief on her behalf, and waived the right to appeal (Tr. at 11-14). The respondent fails to show that she was coerced into accepting pre-hearing voluntary departure or was inhibited from seeking any viable form of relief from removal. She has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he or she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). The respondent has provided no affidavit setting forth the agreement with her former counsel, has not shown that her former attorney has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority.
 
*2 We therefore lack jurisdiction over this case. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31 (1999).

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victoria A. Christian
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N ACt ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; voluntary departure; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. At her hearing before the Immigration Judge on March 16, 2001, the respondent waived her right to appeal and accepted a period of pre-conclusionary voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) (Tr. at 12-13). We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(G). However, even assuming arguendo that we have jurisdiction in this case, the respondent is ineligible for relief from removal because she remained in the United States beyond the date authorized for voluntary departure after receiving oral and written warnings of the consequences of her failure to depart from both the Immigration Judge and this Board (I.J. at 10). See section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act. Contrary to the respondent’s arguments on appeal, the Board lacks authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or other general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for her failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based upon her claim that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent’s motion does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Among other things, Matter of Lozada requires that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel file a complaint against the allegedly-ineffective attorney or provide an adequate explanation for failing to file such a complaint. In her motion, the respondent notes that she has not filed a bar complaint against her former attorney because “this case does not involve failure on the part of the prior counsel with respect to ethical or legal responsibilities; rather the complaint goes to prior counsel’s failure to timely notify the ¿Boardº of an additional basis for relief” (Motion to Remand at 3). For the reasons stated in Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996), we find the respondent’s explanation for her failure to file a bar complaint against her former counsel to be inadequate. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: BERNELLA JOY FORRESTER
File: AXX XX2 960 - Key West, Florida
February 26, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa M. Okoh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before us on October 3, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’ s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s May 22, 2006, decision, finding the respondent removable for commission of an aggravated felony, as defined by section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B); denying her application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), as a matter of discretion; and ordering her removal to Jamaica, for lack of jurisdiction.1 The Board noted, however, that the respondent’s brief alleged that she received ineffective assistance of counsel by former counsel concerning the denial of relief under section 212(c) of the Act. We construed those statements to be a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Since we lacked jurisdiction to address the respondent’s appeal, we also lacked jurisdiction to address a motion to reopen. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); see also Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). Therefore we returned the record to the Immigration Court for the Immigration Judge to consider and adjudicate the respondent’s motion to reopen. In a decision dated October 25, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel as to his presentation of her application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, noting that the record reflected that former counsel had presented “all the evidence and witnesses” and the respondent had been afforded a “fair hearing.” The respondent’s timely appeal of that decision will be dismissed.
 
At the outset, we consider the respondent’s appellate contentions that the Immigration Judge failed to comply with the Board’s remand order, i.e., to consider and address her arguments as to validity of her waived appeal, to be an inaccurate characterization of our decision. The Board’s October 3, 2006, decision specifically noted that in the brief submitted in support of the respondent’s appeal on August 29, 2006, the respondent’s present counsel contested the Immigration Judge’s May 22, 2006, decision, but contained no arguments regarding the withdrawal of the appeal (emphasis added). We remarked, moreover, that in a later filing with the Board requesting a stay of deportation received on September 14, 2006, the respondent’s present counsel stated that the previous attorney had failed to consult with the respondent before filing a waiver of appeal. We observed, however, that at no point had the respondent herself adequately alleged that she received ineffective assistance of counsel in waiving her appeal. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (we have held that statements by counsel are not evidence). Therefore, we concluded the record supported the finding that she had effectively waived her right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993).
 
*2 Instead, the Board “construed the respondent’s statements to be a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance … ¿byº former counsel as to the denial of relief under section 212(c) of the Act,” and as we were without jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen on that specific issue. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600 (BIA 1978) (unless qualified or limited for a specific purpose, a remand is effective for the stated purpose or for consideration of any and all matters which the Immigration Judge deems appropriate in the exercise of his discretion or which are brought to his attention in compliance with the appropriate regulations.). As noted above, the Board’s remand was limited for a specific purpose.
 
Moreover, we note that an Immigration Judge is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing to adjudicate the respondent’s motion to reopen based on allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel in the presentation of her request for relief under section 212(c) of the Act. On remand, the Immigration Judge adjudicated the respondent’s motion and concluded the respondent’s former counsel had presented “all the evidence and witnesses” necessary to demonstrate her eligibility for relief under section 212(c) of the Act and that the respondent had been afforded a “fair hearing.” See Dakane v. United States Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir. 2005) (Alien must show that counsel’s actions were deficient to point where hearing was fundamentally unfair and alien unable to reasonably present his or her case).
 
The respondent raises no arguments on appeal that would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal from the denial of her motion to reopen is dismissed.

The Board noted that On June 1, 2006, the respondent had filed with the immigration court a “Notice of Itent Not to Appeal the Immigration Judge’s Decision”, signed by the respondent’s former counsel, and containing a letter from the respondent which, in no uncertain terms, indicated the respondent’s clear intent not to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision; and requesting expeditious removal to Jamaica. At that point, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final, and the Board no longer had any jurisdiction over the respondent’s subsequently-filed Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), even though it was filed within thirty days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Munawar H. Sandhu, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On January 20, 2006, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure, noting that the respondent had waived the right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The respondent filed Form EOIR-26 on February 14, 2006, asserting that his former attorney did not properly guide him and asked him to accept voluntary departure despite his marriage to a United States citizen.
 
The record reveals that the respondent initially made some equivocal comments when he was questioned about the withdrawal of the application for adjustment of status (Tr. at 53) and that the Immigration Judge allowed the respondent to consult off the record with his attorney, stating that the respondent’s withdrawal of the application and acceptance of voluntary departure had to be knowing and voluntary (Tr. at 53-54). Thereafter, the respondent personally responded to questioning stating that he was making the decision to withdraw the application for adjustment of status of his own free will after consultation with his attorney and that he had also made the decision to accept a final order of voluntary departure after consultation with his attorney and that no one had forced him to make that decision (Tr. at 55).
 
The respondent now essentially claims that former counsel pressured him into withdrawing his application for adjustment of status and waiving his right to appeal. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003). These cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. In this case, the respondent has submitted no affidavit and the statements in the Form EOIR-26 do not show that the attorney has been allowed to respond. There is also no allegation or showing that a bar complaint has been filed. Consequently, we conclude that he has not shown that the waiver of the appeal was due to ineffective assistance of his former counsel.
 
*2 After review of the transcript, we find that the respondent made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, supra. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

FILE A70 576 279 - NEW YORK
Decided February 21, 2007
**1 *87 (1) The Board of Immigration Appeals lacks authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or other general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229c(d)(1) (West Supp. 2006).
 
(2) An alien has not voluntarily failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act when the alien, through no fault of his or her own, was unaware of the voluntary departure order or was physically unable to depart within the time granted.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Ruchi Thaker, Esquire
New York, New York
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Michael Horowitz,
Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: HURWITZ, Acting Vice Chairman; HOLMES and GRANT, Board Members.
GRANT, Board Member:
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has remanded this case with a request that we clarify whether, under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c (2000), “Congress intended to permit courts, in the exercise of their equitable discretion, to grant exceptions to the 10-year ineligibility period imposed as a penalty for failure to comply with voluntary departure orders.” Zmijewska v. Gonzales, 426 F.3d 99, 101 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
The court further requested that we reconsider the respondent’s claims “in light of the Government’s revelation at oral argument that [her] voluntary departure deadline was in fact November 8, 2002, rather than November 9, 2002, and therefore that [her] Board-accredited representative had not informed her of the existence of the BIA’s voluntary departure order by the time her departure deadline passed.” Id. at 100-01.
 
As discussed below, Congress has provided certain exceptions to the penalties for overstaying a period of voluntary departure. The statute now limits application of the penalty provisions to situations in which a respondent *88 “voluntarily fails to depart the United States within the time period specified.” Section 240B(d)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229c(d)(1) (West Supp. 2006) (emphasis added). Thus, assuming the truth of the respondent’s allegations regarding her accredited representative’s delay in informing her of our voluntary departure order, we find that the respondent did not voluntarily fail to depart within the period for voluntary departure. We will therefore vacate our prior decision denying the respondent’s motions to reopen and reconsider, grant her motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
**2 The respondent entered the United States in July 1988 and remained beyond the 6 months authorized by her visitor’s visa. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), now the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), initiated removal proceedings in September 1999.
 
Assisted by an accredited representative, the respondent conceded in Immigration Court that she was subject to removal for staying beyond the period authorized by her nonimmigrant visa. In a decision dated June 13, 2000, the Immigration Judge pretermitted her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (2000), for lack of a qualifying relative. In addition, because the respondent’s pending request for a labor certification had not yet been approved, the Immigration Judge found her ineligible for adjustment of status and any other relief from removal other than voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge issued an order granting the respondent 60 days for voluntary departure from the United States, with an alternate order of removal to Poland. The Immigration Judge also instructed the respondent that if she failed to depart within the time afforded, she would be barred from relief from removal “unless there were exceptional circumstances beyond [her] control as to why [she] didn’t comply with that order of voluntary departure such as being very sick or someone dying in [her] family or some other type of exceptional circumstance.”
 
The respondent timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s pretermission of her request for cancellation of removal. On October 9, 2002, we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal and granted her 30 days for voluntary departure.
 
On January 7, 2003, after learning that her appeal had been dismissed and obtaining new counsel, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by her former representative for failing to seek a remand for adjustment of status while her appeal was pending with the Board and for failing to notify her of the Board’s decision until after the period we granted her for voluntary departure had passed. The respondent attached to her motion to reopen an approved labor certification and an approved employment *89 visa petition. The relevant Visa Bulletins indicate that visas with the respondent’s priority date were available for the respondent’s employment category in March 2002.
 
On April 29, 2003, we denied the motion to reopen. We found that the motion was untimely and, alternatively, that the respondent, as a consequence of overstaying our grant of voluntary departure, was ineligible for adjustment of status under the 10-year bar in section 240B of the Act. We also rejected the respondent’s claim that “exceptional circumstances” excused her from the 10-year bar, finding that although such an exception was included in former section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994), a respondent in removal proceedings instituted on or after April 1, 1997, is subject to the terms of section 240B which, unlike former section 242B, does not contain an “exceptional circumstances” exception for failing to comply with a voluntary departure order.
 
**3 The respondent then filed a timely motion for reconsideration, pointing out that we had erred in finding that the motion to reopen was untimely and requesting that we recognize an exception to the voluntary departure penalty when failure to depart within the time provided is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. On September 26, 2003, we issued a decision acknowledging that the motion to reopen had been timely filed but denying reconsideration on the basis that “[t]he prior decision found that under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, the respondent had not shown ‘exceptional circumstances’ for her failure to comply with the voluntary departure order.”
 
The respondent appealed both the denial of the motion to reopen and the denial of the motion to reconsider to the Second Circuit. In its remand to the Board, the court framed the issue as follows:
The question presented is whether, in light of 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, [the respondent’s] failure to comply with a voluntary departure order renders her statutorily ineligible to receive an adjustment of status arising out of an employment offer, see 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), or whether [she] may instead seek equitable relief from the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) in the extraordinary circumstances presented here-namely, where: (1) [she] relied on erroneous representations of an immigration agent advising her not to seek adjustment of status after receiving a labor certification but prior to the BIA’s order of voluntary departure; (2) [her] Board-accredited representative failed to notify her of the existence of the BIA’s voluntary removal order until the day after she was required to depart the United States; and (3) an Immigration Judge (“IJ”) informed (or misinformed) [the respondent] on the record that even if she failed to depart voluntarily in accordance with a BIA order, she still could avoid becoming statutorily ineligible for further relief by demonstrating that “there were exceptional circumstances beyond [her] control.”

*90 II. ANALYSIS
  
A. Statutory Language
 
We begin with the statutory language of the penalty provisions for failing to depart within the time afforded for voluntary departure. Penalties for failing to depart pursuant to a grant of voluntary departure were first imposed in 1990 with the enactment of section 545(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5061, 5064 (effective Nov. 29, 1990). The statute, which was codified at former section 242B(e)(2)(A) of the Act, provided, in relevant part:
**4 [A]ny alien … who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, other than because of exceptional circumstances, shall not be eligible for relief described in paragraph (5) [including adjustment of status] for a period of 5 years after the scheduled date of departure or the date of unlawful reentry, respectively.
 
(Emphasis added.) The initial penalty provision thus contained an “exceptional circumstances” exception for failing to depart within the allotted time. The term “exceptional circumstances” was defined to include “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Former section 242B(f)(2)of the Act. The statute also required written notice in English and Spanish and oral notice in a language the alien understands of the consequences of failing to depart within the time afforded, other than because of exceptional circumstances. Former section 242B(e)(2)(B) of the Act.
 
In 1996, Congress amended the penalty provision for failure to depart pursuant to a grant of voluntary departure in a number of ways. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Div. C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-587, 3009-596, (“IIRIRA”). Most significantly, the IIRIRA eliminated the “exceptional circumstances” exception. It also added a new clause specifying that the penalties apply to an alien who “fails voluntarily to depart.”1 Id. § 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. at 3009-597. The newly enacted section of the statute regarding penalties for failure to depart provided as follows:
If an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this section and fails voluntarily to depart the United States within the time period specified, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under this section and sections 240A,  *91 245, 248, and 249. The order permitting the alien to depart voluntarily shall inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection.
 
Section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (2000) (emphasis added). We have never directly addressed in a precedent decision the meaning of the phrase “fails voluntarily to depart the United States” contained in section 240B(d).
 
In January 2006, after the Second Circuit remanded this case, Congress amended section 240B(d) of the Act to make two changes relevant to the voluntary departure penalty provision. See Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-162, § 812, 119 Stat. 2960, 3057 (enacted Jan. 5, 2006) (“VAWA”). Section 240B(d) of the Act now provides as follows:
  
Civil Penalty for Failure to Depart
  
(1) In General
 
**5 Subject to paragraph (2), if an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this section and voluntarily fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, the alien —
(A) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000; and
 
(B) shall be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive any further relief under this section and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249.
 
 
  
(2) Application of VAWA Protections
 
The restrictions on relief under paragraph (1) shall not apply to relief under section 240A or 245 on the basis of a petition filed by a VAWA self-petitioner, or a petition filed under section 240A(b)(2), or under section 244(a)(3) (as in effect prior to March 31, 1977), if the extreme cruelty or battery was at least one central reason for the alien’s overstaying the grant of voluntary departure.
 
  
(3) Notice of Penalties
 
The order permitting an alien to depart voluntarily shall inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection.
 
 
In enacting the 2006 amendments, Congress recognized that some VAWA applicants may have overstayed a period of voluntary departure for reasons that justify an exception to the penalty provisions. Notably, the VAWA exception is limited to applicants who demonstrate that extreme cruelty or battery was a central reason for overstaying the grant of voluntary departure. Congress also changed the wording of the introductory clause of section 240B(d) from “fails voluntarily to depart” to “voluntarily fails to depart.” This change in wording clarifies that the phrase was not intended to apply to every alien who failed to depart within the voluntary departure period but was meant to limit the penalties to only those aliens whose failure to depart was voluntary.
  
*92 B. Equitable Exceptions to the Voluntary Departure Penalty Provisions
 
Before reaching the question whether the respondent in this case “voluntarily” failed to depart, we must first address the issue presented on remand, i.e., whether courts may exercise equitable discretion to grant exceptions to the penalty provisions of section 240B(d). We understand that the court’s request requires us to consider whether the statute may be interpreted to afford agency and court authority to recognize equitable exceptions, in addition to the exceptions spelled out in the statute. For the reasons specified below, we find that Congress has not given the Board or the courts authority to recognize equitable exceptions to the section 240B(d) bar beyond those specifically provided in the voluntary departure provisions.
 
The question of equitable exceptions to the voluntary departure penalties involves considerations somewhat different from those relevant to the question of equitable exceptions to statutes of limitations. See Iavorski v. U.S. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129 (2d Cir. 2000). Unlike a statute of limitations, the voluntary departure grant involves a quid pro quo arrangement between an alien and the Government of the United States. Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir. 2006) (“Voluntary departure is the result of an agreed-upon exchange of benefits between an alien and the Government.”)In return for departing within the time afforded for voluntary departure, an alien avoids certain adverse consequences of a removal order. See, e.g., section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (2000)(rendering inadmissible for 10 years an alien who has been ordered removed from the United States.) The voluntary departure agreement comes with warnings of the consequences of failing to depart within the time granted.2 Therefore, exceptions to the penalty provisions, unlike exceptions to a statute of limitation, are included in the statutory framework setting forth the terms of the agreement.
 
**6 In the original version of the statute, Congress afforded a rather broad and open-ended equitable exception to the penalty provisions for aliens who could demonstrate “exceptional circumstances,” which was defined to include “serious illness” and other “compelling circumstances.” See, e.g., Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (finding that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to “exceptional circumstances” in the context of a motion to reopen an in absentia removal order).
 
*93 The congressional repeal of the “exceptional circumstances” exception to the voluntary departure penalty soon after our decision in Matter of Grijalva, supra, and its replacement with a “voluntariness” test strongly suggest that Congress did not intend to allow the Board and the courts to create and apply a set of equitable exceptions that would amount to a substitute version of the repealed “exceptional circumstances” exception. Notably, at the same time that Congress repealed the “exceptional circumstances” exception for voluntary departure penalties, it left intact the same exception for rescission of in absentia orders of removal for failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (2000). Additionally, the wording of the recently enacted VAWA exception, which requires extreme cruelty or battery to be “a central reason” for a VAWA applicant’s failure to depart, indicates that Congress intended to limit the exceptions to the penalties for failure to depart to those situations specifically described in the statute, i.e., the “voluntariness” provision and the VAWA exception.
 
Given the contractual nature of the voluntary departure agreement, the specificity of the exceptions to the penalty provision now provided by Congress, and the amendments to the statute, most particularly the repeal of the more general “exceptional circumstances” exception, we find that Congress intended to foreclose the Board and the courts from applying an open-ended equitable exception to the penalties for failing to depart within the time for voluntary departure.3
  
C. Application of the “Voluntariness” Exception
 
We now turn to the question whether the respondent “voluntarily” failed to depart within the period afforded for voluntary departure. The term “voluntarily” ordinarily refers to conduct that is “brought about of one’s own accord or by free choice.” The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1600 (unabridged ed. 1973). Congress has used the phrase “voluntarily fails” in a number of provisions. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C.A. § 2192a(e) (West Supp. 2006) (a participant who “voluntarily fails” to complete a Department of Defense education program shall provide a refund to the United States in an appropriate amount); 20 U.S.C.A. § 1927(a)(3)(West 2005) (an individual who “voluntarily fails” to complete a term of service with the Capitol police must repay recruitment and relocation bonus *94 on a pro rata basis); 22 U.S.C. § 3657(c)(2) (2000) (an employee who “voluntarily fails” to complete the required period of employment must repay recruitment and retention bonuses). In each instance, the phrase “voluntarily fails” refers to a failure to complete an act or requirement within the actor’s control. See Favreau v. United States, 317 F.3d 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (approving recoupment of enlistment bonuses when service members were unable to meet obesity and physical fitness requirements by examining the voluntariness of the underlying conduct of the employee, rather than the voluntariness of termination). Under the terms of section 240B(d) of the Act, a respondent who, through no fault of her own, remains unaware of the grant of voluntary departure until after the period for voluntary departure has expired cannot be said to have “voluntarily” failed to depart within the period of voluntary departure.
 
**7 We emphasize that the “voluntariness” exception is not a substitute for the repealed “exceptional circumstances” exception. It is a much narrower exception limited to situations in which an alien, through no fault of his or her own, is unaware of the voluntary departure order or is physically unable to depart. It would not include situations in which departure within the period granted would involve exceptional hardships to the alien or close family members. Nor would lack of funds for departure be considered an involuntary failure to depart.
 
The respondent claims that she did not depart the United States within the 30-day period for voluntary departure because her accredited representative failed to inform her of our October 9, 2002, order until after the expiration of her voluntary departure period. When she learned of the order on day 31, she also learned that she had become eligible for adjustment of status during the course of her appeal and could have sought a remand for adjustment of status several months before we issued our decision dismissing her appeal and granting voluntary departure.
 
Ordinarily, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by (1) an affidavit setting out the agreement entered into with counsel, (2) proof that notice of the allegations and an opportunity to respond has been provided to counsel whose representation was allegedly ineffective, and (3) the filing of a complaint with appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation for the failure to file a complaint. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In this case, the respondent was represented by an accredited representative, not an attorney. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1292.1(a)(4), 1292.2(d) (2006). During the course of her appeal, the respondent submitted a copy of a formal complaint provided to her accredited representative and apparently offered him an opportunity to respond. Although we have not yet decided the question whether the Lozada requirements should be strictly applied to an accredited representative, we find *95 that the steps taken by the respondent in this case satisfy the concerns underlying the Lozada requirements.4
 
Assuming the truth of the respondent’s allegations regarding her accredited representative’s conduct, we find that she has shown that she did not “voluntarily” fail to depart within the period of voluntary departure granted by the Board.5 In addition, the respondent in this case was erroneously instructed by the Immigration Judge that the penalty provisions would not apply in the event that she could demonstrate exceptional circumstances for having failed to depart within the time afforded.6 At the time the respondent learned that she had overstayed the 30-day period of voluntary departure granted by the Board, she could reasonably have believed that the ineffective assistance of her accredited representative, and her apparent eligibility for adjustment of status during the course of the appeal, could satisfy an exceptional circumstances exception. See, e.g., Matter of Grijalva, supra (holding that ineffective assistance of counsel that causes an alien to fail to appear for a hearing may amount to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of former section 242B(f)(2) of the Act).
 
**8 Finally, we find that the respondent acted with due diligence in locating new counsel and filing a timely motion to reopen proceedings within 2 months of learning of our order dismissing her appeal and of her eligibility for adjustment of status in removal proceedings. We will therefore vacate our prior decisions denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and motion to reconsider, grant the motion to reopen, and remand the proceedings to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The October 9, 2002, and April 29, 2003, decisions of the Board are vacated.
 
*96 FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The IIRIRA also increased the period of ineligibility for the specified forms of relief from removal from 5 years to 10 years, added a bond requirement, and eliminated the requirement of oral notice of the consequences of failing to depart within the period for voluntary departure.

2

The statute provides that the order permitting an alien to depart voluntarily “shall inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection.” Section 240B(d)(3) of the Act. There is no dispute in this case that the order of voluntary departure provided notice of the consequences of failing to voluntarily depart. Nor is there any question in this case concerning the posting of a voluntary departure bond. See Matter of Diaz-Ruacho, 24 I&N Dec. 47 (BIA 2006) (holding that an alien who fails to post the voluntary departure bond is not subject to penalties for failure to depart within the time specified for voluntary departure).

3

Some courts have ruled that a timely motion to reopen filed before the expiration of a period of voluntary departure tolls the running of the voluntary departure period until the agency rules on the motion. See, e.g., Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278 (9th Cir. 2005) (reaching this result after considering the motion to reopen provisions of section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7) (2000), in conjunction with the voluntary departure provisions of section 240B(d)); cf. Dekoladenu v. Gonzales, 459 F.3d 500 (4th Cir. 2006) (finding that the plain language of section 240B(d) precludes tolling of the voluntary departure period upon the filing of a motion to reopen).

4

Had the respondent been represented by an attorney, we would have expected compliance with the third prong of Matter of Lozada, supra, i.e., the filing of a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation why such a complaint was not filed.

5

Ultimately, we leave the issue of the truth of the respondent’s allegations regarding her accredited representative’s conduct to the Immigration Judge on remand.

6

At the hearing, the Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the following explanation of her right to appeal to the Board and the consequences of failing to comply with the voluntary departure order:
If an individual has a period of voluntary departure and does not leave by that date or the date given by the Appeals Board, then an alternate order of removal, in this case to Poland would go into effect. If you didn’t leave under those circumstances, then you would be barred from reopening your case for 10 years to apply for any form of relief and if you are ultimately removed or deported from the United States, you’d also be barred for 10 years without obtaining a special waiver. All of that would happen unless there were exceptional circumstances beyond your control as to why you didn’t comply with that order of voluntary departure such as being very sick or someone dying in your family or some other type of exceptional circumstance.

In his motion, the respondent has primarily reiterated the arguments that were made in his last motion. We considered these arguments before rendering our previous decision in this case and we decline to revisit them. A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).
 
In the motion, the respondent maintains that his motion to reopen was filed with the Harlingen Immigration Court on September 7, 2005, (not as the Board referenced on March 16, 2006) but it was rescinded by the Immigration Court. While that may be true, it does not explain why the respondent waited until then to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel, when he knew of the in absentia order as early as 1998, at which time he filed a previous motion to reopen through new counsel. Consequently, we find no error in our prior decision denying the motion to reopen. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000)(the decision to reopen proceedings is a discretionary decision, and this court applies a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard when reviewing the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen).
 
The respondent also now alleges that his two previous attorneys who filed motions to reopen should have addressed the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel by the respondent’s first counsel, Lionel Perez. Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider, page3. To the extent the respondent now alleges ineffective assistance by the two previous attorneys, we note that the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: AL ROUMY, SAID
File: AXX-XX6-342 - Detroit
February 20, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mann, George P.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated August 28, 2006. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order on the merits in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 28, 2006. In that decision, we considered the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to grant him a continuance to obtain additional evidence which included statements from family members, but found that neither the respondent nor his counsel specifically requested a continuance and that the respondent was aware of the need to produce corroborating evidence. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must generally be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before November 27, 2606. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until December 14, 2006. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
The evidence submitted in support of reopening includes articles concerning country conditions in Lebanon and evidence from the respondent and his family. The respondent has not contended that the nature of any persecution he reportedly fears has changed in character, but only that it has varied in scope and degree. The evidence submitted does not establish that the respondent is entitled to an exception to the filing requirements for reopening based on an asylum claim arising from materially changed circumstances in Lebanon.
 
The respondent, who was represented throughout the appellate process and during the issuance of multiple decisions by this Board by an attorney, now attempts to raise for the first time a claim of ineffective assistance by an accredited representative at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. There is no allegation or showing that the respondent has given the accredited representative notice of this claim or otherwise complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, as the respondent has not shown due diligence in pursuing this claim of ineffective assistance, we cannot conclude that there is a basis for equitable tolling of the filing date for the motion to reopen. See also Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir.2003) (An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence; prejudice must be shown on ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosenny Burgos, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On September 19, 2005, an Immigration Judge found that the respondent had abandoned his request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(a), because he failed to timely file the application for relief, as ordered by the court. The Immigration Judge declined to reopen or reconsider his decision on October 19, 2005. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on June 28, 2006. The respondent, who is from the Dominican Republic, filed an untimely motion to reopen on December 19, 2006. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent blames the “Hispanic Coalition” for his cancellation application being filed late. However, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that the motion to reopen period is “mandatory and jurisdictional”, and not subject to equitable tolling, even where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised. Abdi v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1149-50 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999)(concerning motion to reopen in absentia order).
 
We note that, in any event, the respondent fails to show diligence in bringing his claims against the Hispanic Coalition. The Immigration Judge set a September 16, 2005, deadline for the respondent to file his cancellation of removal application (Tr. at 7). The respondent states in his affidavit that the Hispanic Coalition agreed to complete the necessary forms, then provide them to an attorney to review (Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶ 8). The respondent states that the Hispanic Coalition gave him the forms on September 19, 2005, and he filed the documents with the Immigration Court on September 21, 2005 (Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶¶ 8-10). The Hispanic Coalition thereafter prepared the motion to reopen submitted to the Immigration Judge, the respondent states, and then helped him file the appeal with the Board (Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶¶ 11-13). The appeal was denied, as stated, on June 28, 2006. Yet the pending motion was not filed for another 6 months. The respondent claims in his affidavit that a representative from the Hispanic Coalition was “rude” when the respondent sought to follow up on his case after we dismissed the appeal on June 28, 2006 (Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶ 14). Yet the respondent fails to explain why he waited so long to file the pending motion with the Board, particularly where his affidavit is dated July 26, 2006.
 
*2 Given the respondent’s lack of diligence in bringing his complaints against the Hispanic Coalition, we will not reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a).
 
The pending motion is, therefore denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 6, 2006. The record reflects that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, which set forth the consequences for a failure to appear. On August 19, 2004, the respondent requested a new hearing date because he was unable to get into the court building to attend his hearing. The Immigration Judge granted his request. The respondent failed to appear for his next hearing on September 17, 2004. He was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge granted reopening. However, the respondent failed to appear for his removal hearing on February 8, 2006. He was again ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia.
 
On July 13, 2006, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. He claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was not supported by an affidavit from the respondent, or any evidence. The Immigration Judge found that statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). She further found that there was no indication that the respondent had been represented by the person he claimed had ineffectively assisted him, and the motion was not supported by an application for the relief sought upon reopening. The Immigration Judge denied reopening.
 
The respondent submitted another motion to reopen on August 3, 2006. He offered evidence that a complaint had been filed against the person who claimed to be an attorney and the notary who assisted him. He also offered an affidavit, an application for cancellation of removal, and evidence to support that application. The respondent claimed that he had appeared for a hearing on August 18, 2004. He stated that he failed to appear for the hearing on February 8, 2006, because the person who claimed to be an attorney said that his case would be transferred and that he did not need to appear. He said that the current whereabouts of that person are unknown so he can not contact him, but that he has otherwise complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had been given notice of the hearing date and previously warned of the consequences for a failure to appear. She found that the respondent’s decision to ignore that warning and follow the advice of the person who assisted him did not amount to exceptional circumstances. The Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s motion. Moreover, the respondent’s motion to reopen is number barred. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We note that the respondent’s proceedings were previously reopened to give him additional opportunities to appear, and we find no merit to his claim that he was denied due process. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven A. Mundie, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated November 30, 2006, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on September 15, 1999. The respondent failed to file his motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Therefore, the motion was correctly found untimely. In his motion, the respondent stated that he failed to appear because he was fearful of being removed. We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s fear of being removed does not constitute “exceptional circumstances.”
 
In his motion before the Immigration Judge, the respondent intimates that his wife’s former counsel failed to file a timely motion to reopen. To the extent this argument is based on ineffective assistance of counsel, it is not supported as required under Matter of Lozada, 19 I& N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Thus, the respondent’s argument fails.
 
The respondent also sought to reopen proceedings to apply for adjustment of status. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).1 Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3). Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and after September 30, 1996. He is accordingly precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.
 
*2 Nor do we find any error in the Immigration Judge’s refusal to reopen sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (The Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Becoming eligible for legal status in this country or relief from deportation after a final administrative order has been entered is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting consideration of an untimely motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien). As a general rule, sua sponte authority is used sparingly and it is not used as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). Although the respondent maintains that his lawful permanent resident wife would suffer hardship if he is removed, we do not find that the respondent has established that an exceptional circumstance exists to justify reopening these proceedings sua sponte. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter of M-S-, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings and involved the interpretation of sections 242B(e)(1) and (5) of the Act, relating to the limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a deportation hearing. However, as section 240(b)(7) of the Act sets forth a similar limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a removal hearing, we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of M-S-, supra, by analogy.

The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on September 15, 1999.

In his motion before the Immigration Judge, the respondent intimates that his wife’s former counsel failed to file a timely motion to reopen.

INS, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Thus, the respondent’s argument fails.
 
The respondent also sought to reopen proceedings to apply for adjustment of status. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).1 Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James T. Stroud, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(d)(11) waiver
 
This matter was first before the Board on March 1, 2005, following the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her application for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). At that time, the Board remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for a waiver under section 212(d)(11) of the Act. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(11) (providing for discretionary waiver of inadmissibility, based upon alien smuggling of family member, for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest). On September 14, 2005, after holding additional hearings, the Immigration Judge denied the waiver, and on October 25, 2006, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision.1 The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at her hearing on her application for the section 212(d)(11) waiver. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen must, among other things, state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). An alien who seeks to remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a heavy burden of proving that if proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
At the outset, we find that the respondent has complied with the technical requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has also presented evidence that her former counsel, Juan Molina, failed to call available witnesses who were willing to testify about the respondent’s good moral character; attempts to further her education; church work; volunteer work; devotion to friends, family, and the community; and to the hardship her deportation would cause to her family. The respondent has submitted evidence that Attorney Molina has been disciplined and suspended by the State Bar of California on several occasions. We further observe that Attorney Molina was suspended from practice before this Board from April 11, 2006, until August 1, 2006.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case originates, has stated that an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin with determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). In addition, “substantial prejudice” must be shown; such prejudice means that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Based upon the record before us, we must conclude that competent counsel would have called available witnesses to testify on behalf of the respondent given that the issue presented to the Immigration Judge was whether the respondent should be granted the relief she sought as a matter of discretion. Notwithstanding this fact, however, we find that the respondent has not established substantial prejudice resulting from the failure to call the witnesses in this case. This is because we find that the outcome of the case would not have been different had the witnesses been called and had they provided the testimony described in their affidavits.
 
The respondent was seeking a section 212(d)(11) waiver of inadmissibility after it was determined she was subject to removal for assisting her adult son to enter the United States illegally. The record establishes that the person the respondent attempted to smuggle into the United States was someone the respondent knew was a convicted criminal who had been deported on multiple occasions and who had been involved in the sale of illegal drugs (Tr. #1 at 66-68, 143-44, 158-60; Tr. #2 at 8, 12). In her original proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent denied any involvement in or even knowledge of the smuggling (Tr. # 1 at 131-33, 140-41). However, after the Board’s remand for consideration of her eligibility for a waiver, she finally changed her story and admitted to knowing about the smuggling of her son (Tr. #2 at 3-7). This son had been living in the house that the respondent owned in Mexico, had been renting out a portion of the house, and had various family members living in the houses around him (Tr. #1 at 59, 65, 68-69, 127, 212).
 
At the time of her hearings, the respondent still owned her house in Mexico (Tr. #1 at 127, 212; Tr. #2 at 4, 20-21). She stated that she had two children, four siblings, and her parents living in Mexico (Tr. #1 at 223; Tr. #2 at 8). Prior to being placed in proceedings, the respondent traveled monthly and sometimes more often to Mexico to visit family (Tr. #1 at 21, 62; Tr. #2 at 24). She testified that she could relocate to Mexico with little difficulty (Tr. #2 at 24-25). The respondent admitted at both of her hearings that she had failed to pay income tax in the United States (Tr. #1 at 193-96, 214; Tr. #2 at 25). She testified that she worked for pay by watching after children and dogs and by cleaning houses, and that she managed an apartment complex, for which she received housing (Tr. #1 at 195-96, 212-14).
 
*3 Even assuming the respondent had presented witnesses at her second hearing who would have testified about her good works, devotion to friends, family, and the community, attempts to educate herself, and to the hardship her deportation would cause to her family, we conclude that the outcome of this case would not have been different. In part, this is because the record already contains letters from friends and clients of the respondent stating that she and her husband are hardworking, that she provides good child care, and that she is very nice and honest (Tr. #1 at 195-97; Exh. 5). The record also contains a letter from the respondent’s church about her volunteer work (Tr. #1 at 198; Exh. 6). Thus, the evidence the respondent seeks to have considered appears to be cumulative.
 
Furthermore, the Immigration Judge exhibited specific awareness of the respondent’s equities in his decision of August 29, 2003 (addressing the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal) (I.J. #1 at 13-16). In that decision, the Immigration Judge extensively discussed various positive and negative factors in the case, including the respondent’s family ties in the United States and Mexico; the respondent’s long residence in the United States; the respondent’s numerous visits to Mexico to see family; the emotional and financial hardship her removal would cause to her husband and other family and to herself; the lost opportunities the respondent would experience; the respondent’s prospects for finding employment in Mexico based upon her experience and skills; the respondent’s lack of a criminal record; the respondent’s volunteer work with her church; the respondent’s ability to speak English; the respondent’s sense of duty to the son she smuggled and the special relationship found to exist between parents and children; the respondent’s refusal at the border to provide a sworn statement; and the fact that the respondent and her son duped the respondent’s husband into participating in the smuggling.
 
Of additional importance to our decision today are the particular circumstances surrounding the respondent’s smuggling of her son. The individual smuggled was a man whom the respondent knew had been involved in illegal drag activity and had been deported from the United States multiple times. Thus, the act of smuggling was directly contrary to the specific efforts of the United States to keep this particular individual out of the country. Moreover, there was no testimony that the smuggling was done out of any extraordinary need. The son was an adult with a place to live in Mexico and with other family members living nearby. We note that the waiver for which the respondent applied is granted for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. It is clearly not in the public interest to grant the waiver to one who intentionally smuggles in someone known to be involved in illegal drugs and who was previously deported numerous times for that involvement.
 
*4 Also significant is the respondent’s failure to tell the truth about the smuggling until after she had been in proceedings for a number of years. Additionally, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent’s failure to pay income tax, particularly in light of her family’s use of public services is significant. She testified that she came to the United states to find a better way of life for herself and her three children and she acknowledged that she remained here illegally and enrolled all of her children (also here illegally) in public schools, and then she further acknowledged that she had failed to pay income tax, even after being granted lawful permanent resident status through an amnesty program (Tr. #1 at 193-94, 211-14, 228; Tr. #2 at 16-20). When asked on July 20, 2005, about her taxes for the prior two years, she indicated that she did not want to pay her taxes until her “situation” was in order (Tr. #2 at 25).
 
Given the particular circumstances of the smuggling in this case; the respondent’s failure over an extended period of time to admit her actions; the respondent’s use of public services for her family but failure to pay her share of income tax, even after having been in proceedings for several years; the fact that the record already contains evidence of the positive factors in this case; and the Immigration Judge’s awareness of the respondent’s equities, we cannot conclude that the additional evidence the respondent seeks to be considered would have made a difference in the outcome of this case. The negative factors in this case greatly outweigh the respondent’s equities. Because the respondent has not presented new evidence with her motion that would likely change the result in the case, her motion to reopen will be denied. See Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Irena I. Karpinski, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(9), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(9)º - Nonimmigrant - failed to comply with conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsidering
 
In a decision dated October 22, 1985, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen, but granted the respondent voluntary departure until April 22, 1986, with an alternative order of deportation to Nigeria. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge on July 5, 2006, through which he sought reopening in order to again apply for adjustment of his immigration status based on his marriage to a different United States citizen. On July 31, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen both on the respondent’s failure to establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment and as a matter of discretion.
 
On August 30, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge issued a decision on September 5, 2006, that found the respondent had appealed the July 2006 decision to the Board and, therefore, the Board had jurisdiction over the motion for reconsideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23 (b)(1). As the contentions on appeal regarding the denial of the motion to reopen are the same as those raised in the motion to reconsider, our discussion of the respondent’s appeal will equally cover the points raised in the motion to reconsider. We therefore will not separately address the motion to reconsider. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his application for adjustment of status should be reopened on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has ruled in Nativi-Gomez v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 805, 807-09 (8th Cir. 2003), that as an alien has no constitutionally protected liberty interest in discretionary adjustment of status relief, alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to seek discretionary adjustment of status relief in a deportation proceeding did not result in a violation of any recognized due process right and, therefore, could not constitute a basis upon which to reopen a deportation proceeding. See also Guerra-Soto v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 637, 640-41 (8th Cir. 2005) (reaffirming that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must fail regarding an entitlement to a form of discretionary relief for the fundamental reason that there is no constitutionally protected interest in seeking discretionary relief). As the respondent’s application for adjustment of status based on his second marriage to a United States citizen is a form of discretionary relief without any constitutionally protected liberty interest, we find that the claim for equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit. For these reasons, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. The motion to reconsider is denied. We need not address other contentions on appeal in light of our holding above.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marsha Williams Mignott, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Morris I. Onyewuchi,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia deportation order that was entered on April 24, 1991, under former section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)) (applies when service, or attempted service, of the notice of hearing, is made prior to June 13, 1992). See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Although the motion was filed fifteen years after the entry of the in absentia order, there is no time limit to file a motion for purposes of rescinding an in absentia order under former section 242(b) of the Act. Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999); Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998). Therefore, the respondent’s equitable tolling argument based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not necessary to our consideration of the motion to rescind the in absentia order.1
 
Ineffective assistance can constitute “reasonable cause” where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), has been satisfied. See Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). In this case, the record shows that the counsel she has accused, Mr. Suhr, did not represent her until 2001, long after the in absentia order was entered. Her failure to appear at her hearing is therefore unrelated to Mr. Suhr’s representation, and we need not further address her ineffective assistance claim.
 
The reason claimed by the respondent for her failure to appear is that she did not receive the hearing notice. She describes her personal circumstances, which led her to reside with her sister and change her address several times. Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s finding, the respondent did submit an affidavit with the motion (Exh. 12). The affidavit does not specify when she relocated with her sister from the Field Crest Drive address to the address on Gordon Way. However, we point out that, while the front side of the Order to Show Cause states the Field Crest Drive address for the respondent, the certified mail return receipt shows that it was actually addressed and mailed by certified mail to “2920 Apt F Gordon Way” in Fayetteville, where it was successfully delivered on November 28, 1990, as evidenced by her sister’s signature. This discrepancy between the address on the face of the Order to Show Cause and the address on the return receipt was apparently missed by the respondent, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Immigration Judge. Since the Gordon Way address had been successfully used in November 1990 to serve the Order to Show Cause, it is unclear why the old Field Crest Drive address, that was apparently taken from an asylum application that was filed back in 1987, was subsequently used to mail the hearing notice on February 8, 1991. We therefore do not find on this record that the respondent was provided a reasonable opportunity to appear at her April 24, 1991, hearing.
 
*2 Accordingly, we will sustain the appeal, rescind the April 24, 1991, in absentia order, reopen the proceedings, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the April 24, 1991, in absentia order is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

We note that even if a statutory deadline applied to motion seeking to reopen an in absentia order that was entered under former section 242(b), the Eleventh Circuit does not recognize equitable tolling of statutory deadlines. See Ali Abdi v. U.S. Attorney General, 430 F.3d 1148, 50 (11th Cir. 2005) (time periods in statute for motions to reopen immigration proceedings are jurisdictional and mandatory); Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The Board issued a final administrative order in this case on April 12, 2006. On December 26, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen which makes a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Mahr, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal. The motion is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final order. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Although ineffective assistance can provide a basis for equitably tolling the statutory and regulatory deadline, we are unpersuaded on this record that Mr. Mahr’s representation affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 f.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The respondent is incorrect in his argument that criminal convictions that are not charged in the Notice to Appear cannot be used as a basis for finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has recently held to the contrary. See Salviejo-Fernandez v. Gonzalez, 455 F.3d 1063 (9th Cir. 2006). Further, the respondent has admitted to having two convictions for possession of marijuana in addition to the possession of stolen property charge that was discussed at his removal hearing. These multiple drug possession convictions in themselves bar relief. See section 240A(b)(1)(C) (barring relief if an alien has been convicted of any offense described under section 212(a)(2), section 237(a)(2), or section 237(a)(3)). It is the respondent who bears the burden of proving his eligibility for discretionary relief, and he has not persuasively shown that Mr. Mahr prejudiced the outcome in his case by conceding at the hearing that his convictions preclude him from meeting that burden.1 To the extent that the respondent is seeking, outside of the scope of these proceedings, to remove those convictions, we will not speculate on his prospects for success and they remain a bar to relief under section 240A(b)(1) cancellation of removal because they have not been vacated for a ground that removes the convictions for immigration purposes. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006); Matter of Picketing, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). The motion is denied.

Indeed, the respondent’s present counsel, in the letter to the Washington State Bar responding to Mr. Mahr’s reply to the disciplinary complaint, points out at page three that the respondent does not have a “realistic chance” to win his case. To the extent that the respondent is now asserting that Mr. Mahr was ineffective in seeking multiple continuances, resulting in the respondent’s detention for a lengthy period in a situation where there was no hope for relief, that is not within our power to correct, as it this possible ineffectiveness neither impacts the respondent’s removability nor his eligibility for relief from removal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicole H. Nelson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas L. Day
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 On March 2, 2004, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2003, decision which denied the motion to terminate proceedings because his conviction had been vacated. On April 1, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. We reconsidered the motion and again dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2005. The respondent appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On July 24, 2006, the Ninth Circuit remanded the record at the request of the Office of Immigration Litigation. The respondent’s appeal again will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, an approximately 49-year-old native and citizen of Canada, who entered the United States on April 17, 1969, as a lawful permanent resident, was convicted on a plea of guilty, on December 5, 2001, in the Washington County Circuit Court, Oregon, of attempted unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance, marihuana. He was sentenced to 3 years’ probation. A Notice to Appear was served on him on June 24, 2002. On August 15, 2002, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and ineligible for relief. The respondent appealed. He also filed a motion to terminate arguing that his conviction had been vacated and provided an order of the Washington County Circuit Court dated May 22, 2003, vacating his conviction on the basis that he had been given ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board remanded proceedings to the Immigration Court to determine the effect of the Circuit Court order. The Immigration Judge declined to terminate proceedings finding that the State of Oregon had appealed the order vacating the conviction. He found that the Circuit Court order had been stayed by the appeal, and, therefore, the respondent had a conviction for immigration purposes. Subsequently, the Oregon Court of Appeals on June 1, 2004, summarily affirmed the Oregon Circuit Court. On June 20, 2006, the Oregon Supreme Court remanded the appeal to the Oregon Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of Gonzalez v. Oregon, 340 Or. 452, 134 P.3d 955 (Or. 2006) (Respondent’s Brief on Remand at 6). In that case, the Oregon Supreme Court found an alien who had been informed that he could be deported as a result of his guilty plea in state court had not been subject to ineffective assistance of counsel solely because counsel had not informed him of the high likelihood of his being deported.
 
As recently reaffirmed by the Board in Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006), if the respondent’s conviction were, in fact, vacated by the state court, the conviction would not be effective for immigration purposes. As the Oregon Court of Appeals, to our knowledge, has not yet ruled on remand whether the Circuit Court properly vacated the respondent’s conviction, the case turns on whether the appeal by the State of Oregon acts as a stay on the order of the Circuit Court. The motion to remand proposes that the Board did not address the issue of whether section 138.650 of the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) incorporated section 138.160 of the ORS. However, the Board clearly quoted both sections and found that under section 138.650 of the ORS, section 138.160, regarding criminal procedure, applied in this case. “‘The manner of taking the appeal and the scope of review by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court shall be the same as that provided by law for appeal in criminal actions, except that ¿certain provisions for transcript and serviceº.’ Section 138.650 of the ORS. Under Oregon Revised Statutes section 138.160, Procedure in Criminal Matters Generally, Appeals; Post-conviction Relief: ‘¿aºn appeal taken by the state stays the effect of the judgment of ¿sicº order in favor of the defendant, so that the release agreement and, if applicable, the security for release, is held for the appearance and surrender of the defendant … but if the defendant is in custody, the defendant may be released by the court … pending the appeal.”’ (BIA 2004 Dec. at 2). The Board did not refer to ORS 138.160 as part of the Post-Conviction Hearings Act in the November 2004 decision (See Respondent’s Brief on Remand at 10).
 
*2 The OIL motion points out that without a remand the Ninth Circuit would be required to interpret Oregon law without the benefit of any input by the Board. The Board does not admit to any particular expertise in regard to Oregon state law. Moreover, the effect of an appeal by the state on a post-conviction motion to vacate appears never to have been a matter of legal controversy within the state. The respondent on remand again has claimed that the order vacating his conviction was not stayed under Oregon law and that a United States District Court had found the respondent does not have a conviction, thus, invoking collateral estoppel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) maintains that the respondent is removable, because the Circuit Court order is stayed and the respondent’s conviction is final for immigration purposes.
 
We conclude, as we did before and for the same reasons, that the Immigration Judge correctly found the respondent removable. The respondent argues that under Schelin v. Maass, 147 Or. App. 351, 936 P.2d 988, rev. den, 325 Or. 446, 940 P.2d 520 (1997), which held that under section 138.650 ORS the “manner of taking the appeal” does not include the taxation of appellate costs and disbursements, the provision for a stay of the lower court order also does not apply. Although the court in that case referenced procedures for filing the appeal under ORS 138.081 as an example of procedures for filing and prosecution of an appeal, the court does not present this as an exhaustive or exclusive example. Id. at 356 n. 3. See also Felkel v. Thompson, 157 Or. App. 218, 970 P.2d 657 (1998), (the court distinguished between the timeliness requirement and the “manner of the appeal” concluding that the manner of the appeal did not include the provision for the timeliness waiver), superceded by, 175 Or. App. 291, 27 P.3d 536 (2001); Holland v. Gladden, 229 Or. 573, 368 P.2d 331 (1962) (service of notice of appeal on the prisoner in a post-conviction proceeding is part of the “manner of taking the appeal”). We conclude that the issue regarding the stay of the lower court’s order is a matter of the manner of the appeal, and that state case law is not in opposition to the interpretation offered by DHS. In addition, the DHS has a copy of a judgment on a probation hearing in this case, entered on October 28, 2004, finding the respondent in violation of his probation, revoking probation, and ordering him committed to jail for 6 months and 1 year PPS. Therefore, it is clear that under Oregon state law the conviction remains in effect during the post- conviction appellate process.
 
As stated in our previous order the United States District Court order directing the release of the respondent does not work a collateral estoppel, among other reasons, because the District Court judge expressly denied that his order had any effect on the deportability of the respondent (Transcript of December 1, 2003, proceedings in the United States District for the District of Oregon, at 8-9). The Judge stated that he was not rendering an opinion on that issue. Id. The Judge also did not decide the effect of the state court appeal of the Circuit Court order. Therefore, this issue was not litigated before the District Court, any admissions of the United States Attorney is not binding, and the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Usman B. Ahmad, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This record was last before us on June 9, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the December 2, 2004, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. We also noted that, although the respondent indicated that he was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he had not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent appealed our decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On March 3, 2006, the Department of Justice made an unopposed motion to remand for reconsideration of the decision in light of evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel that was not previously considered.1 In a decision issued on April 25, 2006, the court remanded the record to the Board for consideration of this evidence and for the issuance of a new decision. Accordingly, pursuant to the court’s instructions, we hereby vacate our June 9, 2005, decision and reconsider the respondent’s appeal and motion.
 
The procedural history of this case is as follows. The Notice to Appear was filed with the Immigration Court in Newark on March 12, 2003. Numerous continuances were granted to the respondent, apparently to give him the opportunity to pursue his application for a labor certification. On July 1, 2004, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, after the respondent failed to appear for the scheduled hearing. However, on August 12, 2004, the Immigration Judge reopened proceedings, over the objection of the Department of Homeland Security, because he was satisfied that the respondent established an “exceptional circumstance” for his failure to appear.
 
On September 23, 2004, the respondent appeared with former counsel, Tomas Espinosa, and applied only for the relief of post-conclusion voluntary departure in accordance with section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). In response to this request, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure for 60 days, with an alternate order of removal to Pakistan. The respondent did not appeal. On October 25, 2004, the respondent, through former counsel, filed a motion to reopen the proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied in a decision dated December 2, 2004. In that decision, the Immigration Judge emphasized that the respondent “did not offer any proof to the court that he possesses an approved labor certification or an approved visa petition.” The respondent then appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen to the Board on January 3, 2005.
 
*2 The respondent subsequently retained new counsel, and made a motion to reopen on March 18, 2005, based on a claim ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney, Mr. Espinosa. As explained in his brief on appeal, dated April 29, 2005, the respondent asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when Mr. Espinosa applied for voluntary departure on his behalf in September 2004. According to the respondent’s affidavit, dated April 29, 2005, Mr. Espinosa “never explained to me the consequences of requesting a voluntary departure compared to ¿theº immigration court issuing an order of deportation.” The respondent later made a motion to reopen, dated May 2, 2005, with which he included documentary evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Upon consideration of the respondent’s submissions, we find that he has complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. However, the respondent has not demonstrated that the tactical decision made by former counsel to request voluntary departure caused him actual prejudice, for he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for any form of relief from removal to warrant reopening of the proceedings. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 107 (3d Cir. 2005). Indeed, after the Third Circuit remanded this case to the Board, the parties were given an opportunity to file with the Board any further submissions by October 6, 2006. The respondent still has not demonstrated that he has an approved labor certification or approved visa petition; his current situation is no different from what it was when the Immigration Judge denied his motion to reopen more than 2 years ago. He cannot demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status in accordance with section 245(a)(2) of the Act. See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)(2).
 
It is well-settled that motions to reopen are disfavored, and that a respondent who seeks to have the proceedings reopened must make a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief from removal. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992). See also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988)( “There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases”). As the respondent is already subject to an administratively final order of removal, he cannot have the proceedings reopened for an indefinite adjournment until some form of relief from removal becomes available to him. See Khan v. Atty. Gen. of U.S., 448 F.3d 226, 234-35 (3d Cir. 2006).
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 2, 2004, is dismissed. The motion to reopen is denied.

At the time of the respondent’s initial motion to reopen, dated March 18, 2005, he asserted ineffective assistance of counsel, but failed to attach any evidence. On May 2, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to remand, with attached evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although this evidence was submitted prior to the Board’s decision, it was not yet in the record at the time the Board issued the decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles C. Nett, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott D. Gordon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION:
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated June 6, 2006. In our order, we adopted and affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge dated April 7, 2005, in which the Immigration Judge found that the respondent waived her right to apply for relief from removal by her failure to timely file her application for relief and supporting documentation. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion, which is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, will be denied.
 
The motion to reopen is untimely because it was originally filed on September 6, 20061 more than 90 days after our final order dated June 6, 2006. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, we decline to address the issue of equitable tolling in the respondent’s case because, even if the deadline was equitably tolled, she failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent did not file a bar complaint against her former counsel whom she asserts provided ineffective assistance, and her explanation as to why she did not file a complaint against her former counsel is inadequate. The respondent’s motion asserts numerous, significant legal errors by her former counsel, yet she states that she did not file a complaint against her former counsel because, in part, he forgave the balance on her account, represented her pro bono for 3 years, and did not “cover up his actions.” We empathize with the respondent’s situation, but the guidelines that we set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, were designed to protect the integrity of the legal system. In that regard, the requirement that disciplinary authorities be notified of breaches of professional conduct highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings, the outcome of which may, and often does, have enormous significance for the person. Id. at 639-40. A respondent cannot disregard the Lozada, supra, requirements simply because she does not want to file a bar complaint against her former counsel. To allow for such an exception would render moot the requirements that we have set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 605 (BIA 1996) (describing the reasoning behind the Lozada requirement for the filing of a bar complaint); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556-60 (BIA 2003) (noting the continued viability of the Lozada requirements). Based on the foregoing, we will deny the respondent’s motion to reopen because she did not comply with the requirements that we have set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey A. Kriezelman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas O’Malley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGES:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(A)º - Excludable at entry under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated September 1, 2005, which denied the respondent’s request for waivers pursuant to section 241(a)(1)(H) and 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not revisiting his deportability pursuant to section 241(a)(1)(A), and also erred in denying his requests for relief. We find a remand proper so that the respondent may be afforded the opportunity to present evidence regarding his deportability. In so finding, we will outline the procedural history of the respondent’s case to clarify the necessity of revisiting the respondent’s deportability.
 
The respondent was served an Order to Show Cause in July of 1994, and charged with section 241(a)(1)(A) of the Act, with underlying allegations that he was excludable at the time of his entry because, while he received a visa as the unmarried son of a lawful permanent resident, the DHS alleged that he was, in fact, married at the time (Exh. 1). The respondent received a merits hearing in 1995, represented by Elliot DuBois, and in a decision dated December 20, 1995, the Immigration Judge found the respondent deportable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent appealed this decision, and also filed a motion to remand based on allegedly unavailable evidence regarding his marital status, and alleged that his inability to file proper evidence regarding his marital status at the hearing was a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. This Board dismissed his appeal on April 25, 2001, although we granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.1 In so finding, we also addressed the respondent’s motion to remand and found that he had failed to comply with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Thereafter, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen, on June 26, 2001, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and submitted evidence that Mr. DuBois had been disbarred from practicing law during the period of time he represented the respondent. The DHS filed a nonopposition to this motion, indicating its belief that the respondent had attempted, in good faith, to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. On October 31, 2001, this Board granted the respondent’s motion based on its non-opposition by the DHS, and remanded the record to the Immigration Court.
 
*2 Most recently, the Immigration Judge conducted a hearing on the respondent’s requests for relief from deportation, but did not revisit the respondent’s deportability, in part, because our April 21, 2001, decision agreed with the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding the respondent’s fraudulent misrepresentations regarding his marital status (Tr. at 38). The Immigration Judge also noted that the Board’s October 31, 2001, remand order gave no directive regarding the issues to be addressed upon remand, and because the respondent’s June 26, 2001, motion referred only to the respondent’s requests for relief, the Immigration Judge chose to tailor the hearing to address only the respondent’s waiver requests (Tr. at 37-39).
 
While we understand the Immigration Judge’s confusion regarding the issues to be addressed upon remand, we note that the basis of the respondent’s Lozada motion, granted by this Board on October 31, 2001, indicates that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel during his initial deportation hearing in 1995. Mr. DuBois represented the respondent during his initial deportation hearing and throughout his appellate process. Inasmuch as the respondent did not receive effective counsel during his 1995 deportation hearing, it is incumbent upon the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent a full and fair hearing upon remand so that he may be afforded the proper due process. See Matter of Lozada supra. Thus, on remand, the Immigration Judge should conduct a full hearing regarding the respondent’s deportability, and if found deportable, any relief therefrom.2 As such, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

On appeal and with his 1996 motion, the respondent was again represented by Elliot DuBois.

We note that, in his most recent appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in giving “diminished weight” to any equities subsequent to 1995 (2005 I.J. Dec. at 8). We agree, and recognize that the respondent’s ongoing proceedings are not frivolous.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher R. Coxe, Jr.,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated July 26, 2006. This matter was previously before this Board on July 26, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s March 15, 2005, decision denying his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) Of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). We also denied the respondent’s motion to reopen (which was filed concurrently with his appeal) based on ineffective assistance of counsel. On October 24, 2006, the respondent, through newly retained counsel, filed a second motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of the respondent’s two former counsels. Subsequently, on October 30, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) filed its opposition to the present motion to reopen. The respondent advances several contentions in his present motion, including that he did not receive a benefit as a consequence of his false representation of United States citizenship. See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 10. Following review of the voluminous evidence submitted in support of the respondent’s present motion, we find that the respondent failed to demonstrate prejudice which persuades us to disturb our decision dated July 26, 2006. In particular, we note that respondent’s new counsel has not presented evidence that, if previously presented, would have resulted in a positive exercise of discretion to the respondent, who has repeatedly misrepresented his immigration and citizenship status in order to procure employment and education benefits. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Henry Zhang, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 19, 2005. The respondent failed to appear for her hearing on May 11, 2004. She was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. On May 18, 2004, a motion to reopen was filed based on a claim of no notice. The Immigration Judge denied the motion. More than a year later, on August 25, 2005, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. She claimed that her former attorney did not inform her of the hearing date, that he filed the prior motion without her consent, and that he made false statements in the motion and forged her signature on the false affidavit attached to the motion. She claims ineffective assistance of counsel. She states that she has complied with the requirements for such a claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We find no merit in the respondent’s assertion in her 2005 motion that, due to a language barrier, she did not know the contents of the prior false motion until now. In her affidavit dated July 19, 2005, the respondent states that she was informed in June 2004 about the in absentia order and the prior motion filed by her former attorney, and that she was angry and took the papers to a few other lawyers who explained to her the false statements made by her former attorney in the motion and in the false affidavit. However, she waited until July 27, 2005, to file a complaint against her former attorney. The respondent has not demonstrated that she informed her former attorney of the allegations leveled against him or gave him an opportunity to respond. Although she filed a complaint with the ExeCutive Office of Imrnigration Review, she has not shown that she has filed a complaint against her former attorney with appropriate disciplinary authorities, such as the attorney’s state bar, with respect to any violation of his ethical or legal responsibilities. The respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. She has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted. Her motion was appropriately denied. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening, termination
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on August 25, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 22, 2006. In that decision the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable pursuant to sections 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i) and (A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i) and (A)(iii), as having been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude; for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation; and as having been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), based on the respondent’s admissions (Tr. at 18-19) and record of convictions (Group Exh.2). Having found the respondent convicted of an aggravated felony under the Act, the Immigration Judge pretermitted his request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and ordered his removal to Mexico (I.J. at 3-4). See Ali v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d 722 (7th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, the Board denied a motion to remand filed by the respondent during the pendency of the appeal, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel by his former counsel, for failure to meet the requirements to establish such a claim as set out by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7 th Cir. 2001) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada). The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen seeking to terminate his proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent requests reopening on the grounds that the convictions which form the essential basis for the grounds of removal have now been vacated.
 
*2 The respondent has offered certified copies of 5 separate orders from the Circuit Court of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit, Kane County, Illinois, dated October 2, 2006; October 4, 2006; October 18, 2006; and November 3, 2006, granting the respondent’s motion to vacate his pleas of guilty as to his January 27, 2006, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; his November 10, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; his October 13, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; his November 14, 2003, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; and his August 5, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of theft, in violation of section 5/16-1(a)(1) of chapter 720 of the ILCS, respectively, and vacating the respondent’s judgements of conviction entered in those cases. The record reflects that the basis for the granting of the respondent’s motions was “the failure to properly admonish the defendant” in violation of 725 ILCS 5/113-8. The only remaining conviction is a March 24, 2006, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Aggravated Battery/Public Place in violation of section 12-4(b)(8) of chapter 720 of the ILCS, which although a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude, was committed more than 5 years after the respondent’s admission for lawful permanent residence in the United States. Moreover, no term of imprisonment was imposed, and as such, the respondent argues that conviction will not support the grounds of removal. We observe the respondent’s motion was properly served on the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), and the DHS has filed no opposition or other response to this motion, and the motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3).
 
The question here is whether there still exists a conviction rendering the respondent removable from the United States, as charged; and if so, whether he can now establish his eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the proceedings should be terminated. Consequently, the motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to enable the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence offered by the respondent relating to his removability pursuant to sections 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i) and (A)(iii) of the Act, and to determine whether there presently remain any grounds for removal and whether he can now establish his eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the proceedings should be terminated. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted. Furthermore, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h)
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 28, 2006, and moves to remand for adjustment of status based upon ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent abandoned his application for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge gave the respondent a reasonable opportunity to file the required documentation and apply for adjustment of status, but he failed to do so timely. “If an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). Because the respondent failed to file the required documents his adjustment application was deemed abandoned, and the Immigration Judge correctly ordered the respondent removed. See also Matter of Balibundi, 19 I&N Dec. 606 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent contends that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in the failure to file timely the application for adjustment of status. This contention is foreclosed by a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605,609 (5th Cir. 2006) (alien has no right to effective assistance of counsel in requesting a discretionary waiver of removal from the Attorney General). “¿Tºhe failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.” Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). As this case arises in the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, this Board follows circuit court precedent in cases arising in that circuit. Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, and the motion to remand is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Theodore N. Cox, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lauren T. Farber
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; waiver of inadmissibility; remand
  
ORDER:
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has timely filed an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s May 31,2005, decision. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s 2001 conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance (crack cocaine and marijuana) constituted a removable offense under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), ordered him removed from the United States, and found that no relief from removal was available, albeit none was requested. On appeal and in a motion to reopen, through counsel, the respondent asserts that based on his previous counsel’s ineffective assistance he wrongfully conceded to the charge of removability and failed to apply for any applications for relief. The respondent seeks a remand to the Immigration Judge in order to apply for such relief. The respondent’s request for oral argument before this Board is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2006). The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
As for counsel’s decision not to file any requests for relief and conceding the charge of removability on the respondent’s behalf, we would observe that absent a showing of egregious circumstances rising to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, decisions of counsel are binding on the respondent. Cf. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986).1 To the extent that the respondent argues that prior counsel’s representation was constitutionally ineffective, we find that he has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); however, he has not provided persuasive evidence of prejudice arising from counsel’s allegedly deficient performance, i.e., evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different had counsel not declined to apply for relief on his behalf or conceded the charge of removability. See, e.g., Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 1993). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is removable as charged based on his 2001 conviction under N.Y. Penal Law § 220.03 for criminal possession of a controlled substance (crack cocaine and marijuana) in the 7th degree (Exh. 2, Tab 3), as this crime is a violation “relating to” a controlled substance under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). In his brief on appeal, the respondent erroneously refers to his 2001 conviction as one for “marijuana possession” only—however, the record of conviction reflects that he was in possession of both marijuana and crack cocaine (see Exh. 2, Tab 3).
 
*2 Respondent contends that he should have been eligible for a number of waivers of inadmissibility for his various convictions in the past, including former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996), sections 212(h) and (i) of the Act, as well as cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). We find his arguments to be unpersuasive.
 
Relief under former section 212(c) of the Act is not available with respect to convictions arising on or after April 1, 1997. 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(3). The respondent’s 2001 conviction occurred after the delimiting date of eligibility for 212(c) relief. Furthermore, relief under the provisions of section 212(h) of the Act is unavailable because that provision only applies “insofar as it relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.…” Section 212(h) of the Act. The waiver can only be applied to one conviction and the respondent has more than one conviction for marijuana possession (Exhs. 2 and 3). Regarding relief under section 212(i), we find no applicability of this section to any of the respondent’s convictions.
 
Lastly, cancellation of removal is not available in this case for two reasons. First, the respondent does not meet the continuous residence requirements under section 240A(a) of the Act. In order for a lawful permanent resident alien to be eligible for cancellation of removal, he or she must have resided continuously in the United States for a period of 7 years after having been admitted in any status. Section 240A(a)(2) of the Act. The respondent first entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 1974 (Exh. 2, Tab 1). His physical presence ended on July 18, 1979, the date of commission of the first qualifying offense. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act; Matter of Perez, 22 I&N Dec. 689, 692-93 (BIA 1999) (indicating that continuous residence or physical presence for cancellation of removal purposes is deemed to end on the date that a qualifying offense has been committed). As this offense was committed less than 5 years after his December 1974 admission, the respondent is ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
The respondent is also ineligible for cancellation of removal on the basis of his conviction for an aggravated felony. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. In addition to the July 1979 and November 2001 controlled substance convictions, the respondent was also convicted in August 1990 under N.Y. Penal Law § 220.03 for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the 7th degree (Exh. 3, Tab 3). Both the 1990 and 2001 convictions constitute a drug-trafficking aggravated felony under sections 101(a)(43)(B) and 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(B) and 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The term aggravated felony is defined by section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act to include “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18; United States Code).” The respondent’s offenses, which involved possession of controlled substances, do not constitute “illicit trafficking” offenses. See Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536 (BIA 1992), modified, Matter of Yanez, 23 I&N Dec. 390 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, those offenses can qualify as aggravated felonies only under the “drug trafficking crime” clause of section 101 (a)(43)(B). In removal proceedings, the status of an offense as a drug trafficking crime is determined by reference to the decisional law of the controlling circuit court of appeals, and not by reference to any independent standard articulated by this Board. Matter of Yanez, supra.
 
*3 The Supreme Court recently, in Lopez v. Gonzales, ____ U.S. ____ (No. 05-547, decided December 5, 2006), noted that “recidivist possession” of drag offenses constitute “drug trafficking crimes” because they are punishable as felonies under the Controlled Substances Act. See Id. at footnote 6. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held that a state conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance qualifies as a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and, by extension, an aggravated felony, if the offense in question was committed after a prior controlled substance conviction became final. United States v. Simpson, 319 F.3d 81 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing 21 U.S.C. § 844(a)). Both of the respondent’s August 1990 and November 2001 convictions for seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance occurred after the respondent’s 1979 conviction for a similar offense became final. Therefore, Second Circuit law dictates that his 1990 and 2001 convictions were for a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and an aggravated felony under section 101 (a)(43)(B). Because either of the respondent’s 1990 or 2001 offenses qualifies as an aggravated felony under Second Circuit law, the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act and statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

We note that the respondent alleges that a hearing disability, which appears to have arisen towards the end of the proceedings, contributed to his denial of due process. Even if true, we find that the respondent was not prejudiced in any way by his alleged hearing disability because the documentary evidence supports the Immigration Judge’s findings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. Christopher Keen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Matthew R. Hall,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on September 28, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. On October 30, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen1 alleging ineffective assistance by former counsel. The motion is denied.
 
In his affidavit submitted with the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, the respondent averred that he was aware of the hearing date but did not appear because “I thought that the Master Hearing was going to be continued” and “I am not sure if there was a miscommunication between me and the Law Firm or if I just misunderstood what I had been told by my lawyer or by his staff-persons.” In the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, former counsel, Mr. Lofgren, stated that although his firm had failed to remind the respondent the night before the hearing, his co-counsel “was fully under the impression that the Respondent was going to appear.” Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, page 2. Former counsel also maintained in the motion that he believed there was “some sort of miscommunication or misunderstanding between this Firm and the Respondent” that caused the respondent to believe that the hearing would be continued. Id.
 
In the current motion before the Board, the respondent now swears in the attached affidavit that former counsel told the respondent that he did not have to attend his hearing on December 20, 2005, because it would be continued. Former counsel’s statement, submitted with the current motion, indicates that his office normally calls clients to remind them of hearings, but in this case they failed to do so. In addition, former counsel states that the respondent did not appear for his hearing because counsel’s office told the respondent that his appeal of the CIS denial of his adjustment application would stop the instant removal proceedings.
 
We agree with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that the current affidavits are not consistent with what the respondent averred in the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. While the previous motion papers indicate possible confusion and misunderstanding, the respondent now contends that former counsel explicitly told him he did not have to attend his hearing. Moreover, we agree with DHS counsel that pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), the respondent was required to attest in detail to the agreement with former counsel as to what actions the counsel would be making on the respondent’s behalf at the hearing below. Despite the Board previously noting in our September 28, 2006, decision that the respondent had failed to fulfill this requirement, no such attestation has yet been proffered. See Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003)(in order to assert an ineffective assistance claim in support of a motion to reopen, alien must comply with the Board’s Lozada requirements).
 
*2 The procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are essentially a “screening device” which the Board considers before considering the merits of ineffective assistance claims. Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1359, 1362 (10th Cir.2004). Here, the record does not reveal a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel. Instead, the respondent has not alleged, let alone established, that former counsel ever agreed to remind the respondent of his hearing.2 The respondent concedes, and the record reflects, that he received notice of the hearing (Exh. 2). In addition, we note that the record does not contain a Form EOIR-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance before Immigration Court, from Mr. Lofgren. Given the inconsistent accounts and lack of any details regarding the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken during proceedings below, we cannot find that the respondent failed to appear due to ineffective assistance by former counsel.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the motion is denied.

The respondent entitled the motion “Respondent’s Brief on Appeal of Denial of Motion to Reopen,” but because the respondent has already had one appeal of the IJ decision, which appeal we dismissed, this latest filing is more appropriately a motion to reopen our previous decision and will be treated as such.

2

At most, former counsel indicates that normally his office calls clients to remind them of hearings. No evidence has been proffered that indicates there was any such agreement or understanding that the respondent would be reminded of the hearing. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. 5, Affidavit of Brian. K. Lofgren.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before us on September 12, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision ordering him removed to his native Cape Verde as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. In our decision, we observed that the respondent had conceded his removability through counsel, and held that this concession qualified as a binding judicial admission. The respondent has now filed a motion, styled as a “motion to reconsider,” in which he claims that his prior attorney’s concession of removability constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
By statute and regulation, a motion to reconsider must state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in a prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C) (West 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (2006). Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 56-57 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion does not specify any legal or factual error in our prior decision upholding the Immigration Judge’s order of removal,1 but instead challenges the validity (or the wisdom) of the concession of removability upon which that order was based. As such, the motion is in the nature of a request for reopening on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
To support a request for reopening on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien in removal proceedings must (1) provide an affidavit attesting the relevant facts, including a statement of the terms of the attorney-client agreement; (2) inform counsel of the allegations and allow counsel an opportunity to respond; (3) file or explain why a grievance has not been filed against the offending attorney. Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 2006 WL 3616557, *2 (5th Cir., December 13, 2006) (citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 639 (BIA 1988)). Although we are mindful of the respondent’s pro se status, his motion must be denied because it does not satisfy any of these threshold requirements. As we observed in our prior decision, moreover, there are many valid reasons why counsel may concede a charge of removability, and therefore absent compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, we are unwilling to conclude that such a concession constitutes ineffective assistance on its face.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

Although the motion reiterates the respondent’s prior appellate arguments regarding the validity of the charge of removability, the respondent does not deny that his counsel conceded removability on his behalf or that such a concession generally qualifies as a binding judicial admission.

Kimberly S. Greer, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on May 5, 2005, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 10, 2003, decision ordering the respondent removed to Mexico. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen which will be denied.
 
The respondent alleges that reopening is warranted, despite the untimeliness of her motion, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006), because she was subject to ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal and that this, in turn, affected her ability to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See, e.g., Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (discussing equitable tolling for untimely motions to reopen where an alien received ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent asserts that she has complied with the procedural requirements for asserting such a claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that in order to prevail on a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish and include the following: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not). However, the respondent also argues that strict compliance with Matter of Lozada is not required inasmuch as her former attorney’s ineffective assistance of counsel is plain on its face. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
We find that the respondent has established a claim for equitable tolling, but nevertheless decline to reopen. While the majority of the cases cited by the respondent in her brief (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9) pertain to situations where counsel has deceived an alien or committed fraud,1 which is not the claim here, the Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling may apply whenever a party is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of a claim. Socop-Gonzales v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). “¿Tºhe party invoking tolling need only show that his or her ignorance of the limitations period was caused by circumstances beyond the party’s control.” Id (citations omitted). Here, the respondent alleges that she was not aware that her previous counsel failed to raise certain issues on appeal — believing they had been preserved — until the Ninth Circuit dismissed her appeal for failing to exhaust administrative remedies available to her. Assuming this failure prejudiced her, the respondent’s former counsel’s conduct could qualify as ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that it did not and decline to reopen or remand.
 
*2 First, the respondent did not comply, substantially or wholly, with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada. Although the respondent has provided a declaration about her agreement with her former counsel, both her letter to counsel informing him of the nature of her allegations of misconduct, and her complaint to the state bar, allege misconduct based on counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal. However, as the respondent’s former counsel explains in his response, we never found the appeal untimely. In other words, the respondent does not inform her previous counsel or the state authorities about the true nature of her allegations of misconduct — that former counsel failed adequately to appeal the issue of whether evidence should have been suppressed below and whether the respondent was removable as charged.
 
The respondent is correct that the Ninth Circuit does not always require strict compliance with the procedural requirements we have set forth in Lozada (Respondent’s Br. at 5). See Rodriguez-Lariz, supra; Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). However, the fact that the respondent has failed to meet the Lozada requirements precludes any presumption that the respondent was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra at 526 (stating that the Lozada factors are intended to ensure that an adequate factual record exists for an ineffective assistance of counsel complaint and that the complaint is legitimate). Therefore, she has failed to meet the threshold requirements for reopening based on such a claim.
 
Furthermore, we disagree that the alleged misconduct is evident on the face of the record, as alleged by the respondent, such that compliance with the procedural requirements are not necessary (Respondent’s Br. at 5). Unlike other cases where the Ninth Circuit has found obvious cases of ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, no need to comply with Lozada, the respondent has failed to establish that her previous attorney’s decision about what issues to raise on appeal and how to articulate them were anything but strategy or, at the most, inadvertence. There certainly is no indication that the respondent’s former counsel lied to the respondent, engaged in fraud, filed the wrong type of petition, or failed to appear. See Rodriguez-Lariz, supra, at 1224-25. Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation hearing results in a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment only when the proceeding is so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting her case. Id. at 1226. The respondent’s former counsel raised the issue of suppression of evidence on appeal — which relates to whether the DHS established the respondent’s removability. It is true that the respondent’s former counsel only raised one of the Immigration Judge’s reasons for finding that the evidence should not be suppressed and that, consequently, the Ninth Circuit held that the respondent failed to exhaust her administrative remedies because the alternative finding was not appealed. However, strategies which are unwise in hindsight do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, 640 F.2d 1139, 1142 (9th Cir. 1981). Furthermore, to establish prejudice, “¿tºhe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984). As on appeal, the respondent has failed to persuade us that there was error in the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the evidence was not tainted and that it established that the respondent was removable for having smuggled in an alien.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ruchi Thaker, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 24, 2005. The respondents have raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and maintain that they have sufficiently complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). It appears, however, that in an effort to comply with Lozada’s requirement that current counsel alert prior counsel to the charges against him and allow him the opportunity to respond, counsel simply sent prior counsel a copy of the motion on the same day that the motion was filed. It would be better practice for counsel to do former counsel and the Board the courtesy of providing former counsel an opportunity to respond to the charges prior to filing a Lozada motion. Counsel should endeavor to ascertain the merits of a respondent’s claims before filing in order to avoid potentially besmirching prior counsel’s reputation wrongly and occupying the Board’s time with a frivolous motion.
 
Because prior counsel has vigorously denied the accusations leveled against him in the respondents’ motion, we find it appropriate to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Court for the sole initial purpose of allowing the Immigration Judge and the parties to address in the first instance the question as to whether prior counsel did, in fact, provide ineffective assistance to the respondents at certain critical points in their proceedings, as claimed. If, after resolving the necessary factual and legal arguments, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondents’ claims as to ineffective assistance are without merit, the Immigration Judge should once again enter orders of removal based upon the respondents’ failure to appear for their May 13, 2004, hearing. If, however, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondents’ claims as to ineffective assistance have merit, the Immigration Judge should then entertain any applications for relief from removal. Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael P. DiRaimondo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James D. Paoli
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on April 5, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision, which had denied his suspension of deportation application and granted him voluntary departure. The respondent, through new counsel, now has filed a motion to reopen, which will be denied.
 
On April 5, 2002, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision which had denied his suspension application. We agreed with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent had not established that his deportation to Poland would cause extreme hardship to himself or his United States citizen son, and we noted that the respondent’s counsel had not filed a brief as indicated. We granted the respondent 30 days in which to voluntarily depart the United States. The respondent has never departed the United States as instructed, and he remains in the United States illegally.
 
As a preliminary matter, we observe that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. Our prior order in these proceedings was entered on April 5, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before July 7, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until more than 4 years later, on October 24, 2006. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues in its response that the motion should be denied solely on this basis.
 
Although the respondent’s motion is based in part on the alleged ineffective assistance of his former counsel, who has faced state bar disciplinary action for wholly unrelated conduct, the respondent does not allege sufficient facts that would compel us to apply the principle of “equitable tolling” to the motion filing deadline. Specifically, he has alleged no misconduct on the part of former counsel that prevented him from filing his motion in a timely manner, or at least somewhat sooner than it has been filed.1
 
Therefore he has failed to exercise due diligence in his case to obtain equitable tolling under applicable Second Circuit law.2 Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000)(alien who waited 2 1/2 years to file motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel did not establish due diligence to merit equitable tolling). Moreover, we note that the respondent’s counsel has attached copies of two previous unpublished Board orders in which he filed motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of previous counsel on behalf of other aliens, and he alleges that the Board is “obligated to follow its prior decisions.” In this regard, we point out that unpublished Board orders do not represent binding precedent in the respondent’s case. Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216 (BIA 1990); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g).
 
*2 We observe that previous counsel’s failure to file a brief was not the only reason we cited in our prior order as the sole basis for dismissing the appeal, as incorrectly alleged by present counsel in his motion. Our order dismissing the respondent’s appeal indicated that we had reviewed the Immigration Judge’s decision, and agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had failed to establish extreme hardship to either himself or his United States citizen son to qualify for suspension. Under these circumstances, as the respondent has not established prejudice, he has not met the standards for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent also has alleged that his motion deserves to be granted in the exercise of discretion because of new facts, including the maturing and educational advancement of his now 13-year-old son, and the respondent’s own marriage to a lawful permanent resident. We decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the respondent’s case on this basis. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

For purposes of completeness, we note that the respondent does not allege that his previous attorney committed any fraud in his representation.

2

Although counsel includes an unexplained citation to Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1993) in a supplemental letter, we observe that the alien’s counsel in Esposito v. INS, supra, failed to file an appeal with the Board. Therefore, the issue of an attorney’s failure to file a brief on appeal was not addressed, and that case may be distinguished on the facts from the instant case.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yvette W. Lewis-Williams, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a citizen of Peru. On July 20, 1994, she appeared before an Immigration Judge, and agreed to voluntarily depart the United States by October 24, 1994. That decision was not appealed to the Board. On May 3, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. with the Immigration Judge. Therein, the respondent requested reopening to seek adjustment of status as a victim of abuse by her United States citizen spouse.1 The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely on June 12, 2006, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Section 1003.23(b)(4) of 8 Code of Federal Regulations provides that “except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.”
 
The record reflects that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed with the Immigration Judge on May 3, 2006. Because the respondent’s motion was filed after September 30, 1996, it is untimely and was properly denied by the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4); Da Cruz v. INS, 4 F.3d 721 (9th Cir. 1993). We have also determined that the exceptions to these filing requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) are inapplicable.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she did not understand the nature and consequences of her deportation hearing, and therefore that decision is not final. However, the period for appealing, reopening, and reconsidering the Immigration Judge’s decision has elapsed. The decision of the Immigration Judge rendered on July 20, 1994, is final. This aspect of the appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that she is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for presenting such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98 (3rd Cir. 2005). We therefore cannot reopen these proceedings on account of this reason.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that her motion should have been deemed a joint motion to reopen. She argues that the motion was unopposed because the DHS adjudication officer recommended that she seek reopening before the Immigration Judge, and never attempted to execute the deportation order. The respondent further notes that the DHS may have filed its opposition to her request for reopening untimely. Notwithstanding her contentions, we cannot find that any recommendation that the respondent may have received constitutes a non-opposition to her motion provided to the Immigration Court. In addition, even if the DHS filed an untimely opposition to her motion to reopen, we cannot find that such constitutes a joint request for reopening. We therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely filed.
 
*2 The Board’s discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases where exceptional situations are demonstrated. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We note that the respondent is apparently the victim of domestic abuse, as she is the beneficiary of an approved Form I-360. Moreover, the respondent married prior to the commencement of proceedings, and has been in this country for approximately 16 years. She is also the parent of a 7-year-old United States citizen child, and has been under an order of supervision with the DHS since March 2006. Having considered the totality of the circumstances, we find that an exceptional situation exists to reopen these proceedings sua sponte.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan J. Mendoza, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility; remand
 
The respondent has appealed the November 1, 2005, and December 12, 2005,1 decisions of an Immigration Judge which found him removable, pretermitted his application for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), and ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The DHS opposes the appeal and the motion. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
In a Notice to Appear dated November 4, 2004, it was alleged that: the respondent’s status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident on April 3, 1991, and that he was convicted in Texas on February 7, 1992, for burglary of a building with intent to commit theft, and on April 29, 1996, for tampering with a government record. The respondent was charged with removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), as an alien convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. The respondent indicated that he wanted to pursue a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act.
 
At a hearing on November 1, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserted that the respondent was not eligible for a 212(c) waiver under section 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) due his removability for two crimes involving moral turpitude, one of which involved a plea made after the enactment of AEDPA. The Immigration Judge then entered a summary order finding the respondent removable as charged based on his concessions, and gave the DHS until December 1, 2005, to file a motion to pretermit. The respondent was given until December 8, 2005, to reply.
 
On November 2, 2005, the DHS filed a motion to pretermit based on the argument it presented at the hearing. It also submitted a Form I-261 which lodged an additional charge of removability under section 237(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, for a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) committed within 5 years of entry for which a sentence of 1 year or longer may be imposed. The DHS also made the following substitute allegations of fact: that the respondent was admitted as a conditional resident on December 15, 1988, and that he was convicted of burglary on February 2, 1992, for a crime committed on January 12, 1992. The DHS added the following allegations of fact: that the conditional nature of the respondent’s status was removed on April 3, 1991, and that a year or longer could have been imposed for his burglary conviction. On December 5, 2005, the respondent filed additional documents to support his 212(c) application, but he did not respond to the motion to pretermit.
 
*2 On December 12, 2005, the Immigration Judge issued an order granting the motion to pretermit, and ordering the respondent removed to Mexico. Her reasoning was that the respondent failed to respond to the DHS’ motion, and therefore it was deemed unopposed.
 
The respondent subsequently filed this appeal. He asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the DHS’ motion to pretermit solely on the lack of any response, and that she should have given him an opportunity to respond to the allegations and charge in the Form I-261. He also argues that the DHS failed to meet its burden of showing that his conviction for tampering with a government record was a CIMT. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. He argues that his counsel at the hearing erred in failing to respond to the DHS’ motion to pretermit, and in not advising him to apply for cancellation of removal for permanent residents. He has filed supporting documents to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The DHS opposes the appeal and the motion.
 
We are remanding the record for the following reasons. The Immigration Judge’s summary finding of removability made on November 1, 2005, refers to a concession of removability. However, there is no concession of removability in the record, and no explanation as to why both of the respondent’s crimes were deemed to be CIMTs (see Tr. at 7-8; 12-13). This alone is a basis for a remand. Further, the Immigration Judge should not have entered her final order without addressing the lodged allegations and charge filed by the DHS. Further, the respondent should have been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations and additional charge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.30, 1240.10(e).
 
Finally, we question the Immigration Judge’s decision to grant the motion to pretermit without providing any reasoning except that it was unopposed. The underlying issue involved a legal determination which should have been specifically addressed. Nonetheless, the DHS appears correct because in the case of a guilty plea made between April 24, 1996, and April 1, 1997, an application for a 212(c) waiver is subject to the limitations of AEDPA § 440(d). See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(2). Section 440(d) of AEDPA changed the last sentence of section 212(c) of the Act to provide that:
This subsection shall not apply to an alien who is deportable by reason of having committed any criminal offense covered in section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B),(C), or (D), or any offense covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) ¿two CIMTsº for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to the date of their commission, otherwise covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(i).
 
*3 See also Matter of Fuentes-Campos, 21 I&N Dec. 905, 906 (BIA 1997). The issue is therefore whether the respondent’s individual convictions for a CIMT fall under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act (formerly section 241(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act).2 The CIMT charges therefore need to be premised on a conviction for which a sentence of 1 year or longer may be imposed. In this regard, the lodged allegations of fact become important, and the underlying statutes and conviction records must be examined to determine the nature of the respondent’s convictions. It appears that both convictions were for felonies (see Exh. 2, attachments), but this is a matter which is more appropriately resolved on remand.3 See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (precluding the Board from engaging in fact finding on appeal). Insofar as the respondent contends in his motion that he is eligible for cancellation of removal, his 1992 crime cuts off the necessary period of continuous physical presence if calculated from his entry as a conditional permanent resident in 1988. See sections 240A(a)(2) and 240(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2) and (d)(1)(B); Matter of Jurado, 23 I&N Dec. 29, 32 (BIA 2006). Because the record is being remanded for a new hearing, we need not address the respondent’s allegations that he had ineffective assistance of counsel at the earlier proceedings. An appropriate order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

The Immigration Judge dated the latter decision August 12, 2005. The transmittal letter attached to the decision, and other documents in the record, indicate this is the wrong date.

2

Section 241 of the Act applied to deportation proceedings, and was the precursor to section 237 of the Act. The regulations state that § 440(d) applies to aliens in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(2). We note that prior to the enactment of AEDPA, the single CIMT ground required that an alien be sentenced to confinement for 1 year or longer for his or her crime. This version of the ground only applies to aliens whose proceedings were initiated prior to AEDPA’s enactment date of April 24, 1996. See Matter of Fortiz, 21 I&N Dec. 1199, 1202-03 (BIA 1998).

3

On appeal, the respondent asserts that he is not subject to § 440(d) limitations because his second crime was committed more than five years after his admission. However, the language of § 440(d) provides that the evaluation of the two CIMTs shall be made “regardless of the date of their commission.”

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 26, 2006. On August 23, 2006, the respondent moved for reopening so that he could apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to waive the immigration consequences of his 1996 conviction for attempted sale of cocaine. Exh. 1. The respondent also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his original removal hearing (an order of removal was issued by an Immigration Judge on March 18, 2002) because his former counsel failed to file an appeal. Insofar as the respondent argues that filing deadlines governing his motion to reopen should be tolled due to the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that the respondent’s motion makes no showing that he acted with due diligence over the intervening years to discover and remedy any ineffective assistance of his former counsel. Thus, equitable tolling cannot be applied to suspend the general filing deadlines that require that motions to reopen he filed within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(c); see Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). Moreover, we have stated that the mere failure to file an appeal does not necessarily equate with prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (failure to timely file an appeal is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel without showing that alien would likely have prevailed on appeal). Furthermore, as the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent’s motion is also untimely under the regulations governing special motions to reopen to apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(h) (requiring such motions to be filed by April 26, 2005). As the respondent has not met his burden to show that he is eligible for any relief from removal (particularly in view of the fact that by now, he appears to have already served more than five years, combined, for two aggravated felony convictions), there is no basis for reopening even if the motion were timely filed. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on June 8, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On July 6, 2006, the respondent filed an untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will construe the respondent’s request as a motion to reopen sua sponte because his conviction, which was the basis for removability, was vacated and the underlying complaint dismissed for failure to prosecute.
 
The respondent has presented evidence that his conviction was vacated based on allegations that his plea violated the Iowa Rules of Criminal Procedure, he did not waive his right to make a motion and arrest of judgment, and his plea was inadequate due to no factual basis, ineffective assistance of counsel, and failure to understand the elements of the crime. In addition, the respondent presented a certified copy of a court document indicating that the charges were dismissed due to lack of prosecution. Accordingly, the respondent’s conviction is no longer valid for immigration purposes. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006)(a conviction vacated because trial court failed to advise alien defendant of immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). Since the reason for finding that the respondent was removable no longer exists, the respondent has demonstrated exceptional circumstances justifying sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(Board retains limited discretionary power under the regulations to reopen or reconsider only in exceptional circumstances). Accordingly, the motion to reopen sua sponte is granted, the prior decisions of the Board and the Immigration Judge are vacated, and the record remanded for further proceedings.

Thaker, Ruchi, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 10, 2004. At that time, we denied the respondent’s appeal as untimely filed. More than 2 years later, on November 6, 2006, the respondent submitted a motion to accept his appeal by certification due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, Joseph C. Sekula. He claimed that he consulted with various lawyers over the last 2 years about what, if anything, could be done on his case. He stated that he retained a lawyer who obtained his immigration record on August 29, 2006, he then retained a different lawyer after he was detained on August 30, 2006, and finally he retained another lawyer after that. He offers a copy of a letter addressed to the Office of Attorney Ethics, dated November 3, 2006, regarding Mr. Sekula. It includes a notation that a copy will be sent to Mr. Sekula. However, there is no evidence that the complaint was filed, and no evidence that Mr. Sekula was actually informed of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond. We find that the respondent has not presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, there is no evidence that the respondent took any action regarding the alleged ineffective assistance of Mr. Sekula until late in 2006. His lack of diligence indicates that reopening is not warranted as a matter of discretion. We find no basis to consider the respondent’s appeal on certification pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David E. Piver, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 5, 2006. In our prior decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent now argues that the motion should have been granted due to the ineffectiveness of his former counsel and that the record should be remanded to permit him to apply for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not oppose the motion, which will be denied.
 
We note that the respondent alleges that his appeal was untimely due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that his prior counsel failed to timely file a motion to reopen the Immigration Judge’s decision or to notify the respondent that he had failed to do so. As a result, the respondent’s voluntary departure period was not tolled and the respondent failed to leave at the end of that period, thereby rendering him ineligible for certain forms of relief for 10 years.
 
Even if we were to find that the respondent has met the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel in this case, see Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003), the respondent has not met the requirements for a motion to reopen for consideration of his adjustment of status application. In his motion, the respondent alleges that the visa petition filed on his behalf by his lawful permanent resident spouse is pending for adjudication with the DHS but has not yet been approved. Further, although the respondent’s spouse has applied for her United States citizenship, she is not yet a United States citizen and the respondent’s priority date is not yet current. Therefore, even upon approval of the respondent’s petition, there is not a visa immediately available to him. Accordingly, he is not prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. See, e.g., INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (an alien must make a prima facie showing both statutory eligibility for the relief sought and that relief is warranted in the exercise of discretion); Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996) (an applicant demonstrates prima facie eligibility for relief where the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Zaehringer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathryn E. Stuever
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
By an order dated August 23, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent to have abandoned any and all claims for removal relief, and ordered her removal from the United States. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision, as well as a motion to remand. The respondent’s request for a waiver of the filing fee associated with the filing of an appeal is granted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) and 1003.8(c). The motion will be granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that her immigration proceedings should be reopened due to the ineffective assistance of her prior attorney, Mr. Harpreet S. Brar. More specifically, the respondent avers that but for the actions of Mr. Brar, she would not only have contested her single charge of removability, but she would also have submitted an alternative motion to withdraw her application for admission within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge. The respondent further argues that Mr. Brat failed to inform her of the Immigration Court’s decision, which hampered her ability to file the instant appeal.
 
Before making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the alien must ordinarily comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Those requirements include: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved alien setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her former counsel, (2) that the representative whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the respondent’s motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. See id.; see also Siong v. INS, 376 F.3d 1030, 1036-37 (9th Cir. 2004). Moreover, the alien must also show prejudice from counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005); Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir.2003). Prejudice results when “the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Munoz v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
*2 Based upon the record before us, we find that the respondent has substantially complied with the Lozada requirements. See Respondent’s Brief, sub-exhs. 1-3. We further find that the record supports the respondent’s contention that she was prejudiced by the actions of her former counsel. For instance, Mr. Brar failed to meet any of the filing requirements set by the Immigration Judge, despite his written acknowledgment of those deadlines. See Exh. 5 (evidencing counsel’s awareness that he was to submit both the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings and her withdrawal application for admission by July 20, 2006); see also Tr. at 10-17. See generally Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 588 n.5 (9th Cir. 2006); Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding ineffective assistance where counsel failed to file an application for relief for which the alien was prima facie eligible). The respondent’s prior attorney also failed to keep his client informed as to the status of her case. See generally Ray v. Gonzales, supra. Given the fact that she has been detained throughout these proceedings, we find that it was particularly incumbent upon Mr. Brar to keep in contact with the respondent. See generally Siong v. INS, supra. Thus, inasmuch as it appears that Mr. Brar’s failure to act denied the respondent an opportunity to establish her eligibility for any form of removal relief, we find that the respondent has suffered actual prejudice. Accordingly, we shall grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, and remand the record to the Immigration Court for additional proceedings.
 
In view of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marshal E. Hyman, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on January 28, 2005, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal. On July 24, 2006, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen. The respondent contends that the time limitation on a motion to reopen, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), should be tolled and that her proceeding should be reopened due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003). Further, the respondent has shown ineffective assistance by her former counsel. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). The respondent avers that her former counsel specifically directed that she not appear at her initial master calendar hearing because he was seeking consolidation of her proceeding with that of her parents. The record contains a statement from the Department of Homeland Security anticipating that the respondent’s proceeding would be heard with her family (Exh. 3). However, the respondent’s former counsel never filed a motion to consolidate, and the record does not contain any other document indicating that a request to consolidate and/or transfer venue was filed or presented. In a motion to reopen/rescind filed with the Immigration Court, the respondent’s former counsel alleged that government counsel indicated that she would route the case so that it would be consolidated, but government counsel denied that she was the trial attorney at the respondent’s family’s master calendar hearings.
 
Given these facts and circumstances, we find that the actions and advice of the respondent’s former counsel constituted ineffective assistance and that the respondent has demonstrated due diligence in presenting her claim in this regard. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted. Further, our decision, as well as the Immigration Judge’s decisions, are vacated, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas A. Grannan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of an aggravated felony
Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of a controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This matter has a long history before this Board, beginning with the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 2, 1998, decision in which he found the respondent, who on May 30, 1996, had been convicted of two counts of distribution of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1997); and ordered the respondent deported from the United States. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that decision by order dated December 6, 1999.
 
On September 11, 2006, when this matter was last before us, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our April 10, 2006, decision. In the April 10, 2006, decision, we denied his motion to reopen as time and number barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In the instant motion, styled “Lozada Motion to Reopen,” the respondent argues that the proceedings should be reopened pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) to permit him to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c).1 The respondent contends that he would have earlier applied for a waiver of inadmissibility under the St. Cyr decision had it not been for the ineffective assistance of his previous counsel. In support of his motion, the respondent provided a copy of the formal complaint that he has filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority against his former counsel, a copy of a letter notifying his former counsel of the complaint and giving him the opportunity to respond to the charges, and affidavits setting out the basis of his claim against his former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Even if the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, he does not benefit from the St. Cyr. decision and cannot therefore demonstrate prejudice. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98 (3rd Cir. 2005); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. We find that the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails and the motion will be denied on that basis.
 
*2 In INS v. St. Cyr, supra, the Supreme Court held that discretionary relief under former § 212(c) “remains available for aliens … whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who … would have been eligible for § 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.” See INS v. St. Cyr, supra, at 326. Here, the deportation proceedings were initiated against the respondent on March 27, 1997, with the filing of the Order to Show Cause (Form I-221) with the Immigration Court. The law in effect at the time of the respondent’s May 30, 1996, conviction was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214), which was enacted on April 24, 1996. Thus, the respondent, who subsequent to April 24, 1996 was convicted of an aggravated felony, was not eligible for section 212(c) relief when his guilty plea was entered on May 30, 1996. See INS v. St. Cyr, supra; DiPeppe v. Quarantillo, 337 F.3d 326 (3rd Cir. 2003); Perez v. Elwood, 294 F.3d 552 (3d Cir. 2002); DeSousa v. Reno, 190 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 1999). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44 (section 212(c) available where proceedings initiated before April 24, 1996).
 
In addition, the record shows that in late July 2001 or early August 2001, the respondent was deported from the United States. See Respondent’s Affidavit in support of the instant motion. He may not reopen the original immigration proceedings to apply for a waiver of deportation because he left the United States after those proceedings were initiated. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2) (specifically providing that special motions to reopen are unavailable to aliens “issued a final order of deportation … who then illegally returned to the United States”). We note that the respondent did not state in his affidavit whether he has returned to the United States and if so, under what circumstances. In any event, the respondent’s departure deprived this Board of jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Our records show that although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to the respondent’s motion to reconsider, the instant brief was fast filed herein as “Respondent’s Response to Government’s Opposition” on September 11, 2006, the same date that our previous decision was issued. Given the respondent’s expression of dissatisfaction with his former counsel’s performance in his brief and supporting affidavit, we noted the respondent’s failing to satisfy the procedural requirements of and demonstrate prejudice as required by Matter of Lozada.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank P. Sprouls, Esq.
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)º - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
  
APPLICATION: Continuance
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 7, 2006, finding the respondent removable pursuant to sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (2)(A)(i)(II), as having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude as well as having been convicted of a controlled substance violation, based on his record of conviction1 (Exh. 2, 3) and ordering his removal to Mexico, will be dismissed.
 
We find no merit to the contentions raised by the respondent on appeal. Specifically, the respondent argues on appeal that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by his criminal attorney in that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea as to his 1998 California controlled substance conviction (Exh. 2), and the Immigration Judge erred in not granting his request for a further continuance while awaiting action on his appeal of the denial of his post-conviction motion to set aside and vacate the conviction in that case (Tr. at 6-7).
 
At the outset, even if we were to accept the respondent’ s assertion that the attorney at his criminal trial did not explain the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, he has not demonstrated that his counsel’s actions were objectively unreasonable so as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of due process, undermining the validity of the respondent’s 1998 California drug trafficking conviction (Exh. 2) upon which one of the charges of removability is premised and precluding his eligibility for relief from removal. See United States v. Fry, 322 F.3d 1198, 1200 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984) as to the standards required for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a criminal proceeding). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, citing to its decision in United States v. Fry, supra at 1200, has held that “the failure of counsel to advise his client of the potential immigration consequences of a conviction does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.” See Resendiz v. Kovensky, 416 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2005). The court in U.S. v. Kwan, 407 F.3d 1005, 1015 (9th Cir. 2005) observed that “¿wºhile ¿the Ninth Circuit hasº not yet determined what ‘more’ would cause a defense Counsel’s advice, or lack thereof, regarding the immigration consequences of a conviction to fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, ¿the court notedº that the Second Circuit ¿in United States v. Couto, 311 F.3d 179, 187-88 (2d Cir. 2002)ºhas held that an affirmative misrepresentation regarding immigration consequences is deficient under Strickland.” However, in the matter before us, the respondent does not allege any “affirmative misrepresentation regarding immigration consequences” by his criminal attorney, only that she failed to advise him as to the possible immigration consequences of his guilty plea.
 
*2 Notwithstanding, it is clear that an Immigration Judge and the Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction, unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding his guilt or innocence. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). In addition, the Ninth Circuit has held that the Immigration Judge and the Board may not adjudicate the validity of an underlying criminal conviction. See Pablo v. INS, 72 F.3d 110, 113 (9th Cir. 1995) (the court observed that “¿tºhe BIA correctly refused, in effect, to retry these criminal cases based on ¿alienº’s claim that he was innocent of the charges although he pleaded guilty to them”’; De la Cruz v. INS, 951 F.2d 226, 228 (9th Cir. 1991) (Upon petitioner’s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his state court criminal trial because he was not advised of the deportation consequences of pleading guilty, the court recited that the “INS has no power to adjudicate the validity of state convictions underlying deportation hearings”). We observe, moreover, that a conviction is deemed final when all direct appeals have been exhausted or waived. See Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546 (BIA 1988). The pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks, not constituting direct appeals, however, does not serve to negate the finality of the convictions or the charge of deportability, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to that motion. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 1993).
 
In addition, the respondent is precluded from collaterally attacking his criminal record of conviction in a deportation proceeding. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir. 1993) (citing Avila-Murrieta v. INS, 762 F.2d 733, 736 (9th Cir.1985) and Ocon-Perez v. INS, 550 F.2d 1153, 1154 (9th Cir. 1977)). Moreover, the court in Urbina-Mauricio found that “¿aºcriminal conviction is final for the purposes of immigration review if the alien has exhausted or waived direct appellate review.” Urbina-Mauricio, supra at 1089 (citing Hernandez-Almanza v. INS, 547 F.2d 100, 103 (9th Cir. 1976)). Furthermore, the fact that a criminal defendant is not advised of the collateral immigration consequences of his plea does not amount to a denial of due process that would vitiate the plea. See U.S. v. Amador-Leal, 276 F.3d 511, 517 (9th Cir. 2002); see also United States v. Osiemi, 980 F.2d 344, 349 (5th Cir. 1993).
 
*3 Moreover, the decision to grant or deny a continuance is in the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. See De La Cruz v. INS, supra; see also Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). That decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, supra at 237; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. There is no indication in the record that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. The record clearly indicates that the conviction record (Exhs. 2, 3) entered into evidence relates to the respondent and is final and not under direct appeal, and supports the Immigration Judge’s findings as to the charges of removability (Tr. at 7-8).
 
An Immigration Judge presented with a facially valid charge of removability need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. See Contreras v. Schiltgen, 122 F.3d 30, 33-34 (9th Cir. 1997), aff’d on add’l grounds in Contreras v. Schiltgen, 151 F.3d 906 (9th Cir. 1998) (Contreras II) (the court found that the “validity of ¿the alien’sº California conviction can only be tested in an action against the state, which has the greatest interest in preserving its judgment and the best ability to either correct or defend it …and … ¿uºntil ¿the alienº has successfully overturned his conviction in such a proceeding, the ¿Immigration Judgeº is entitled to rely on the conviction as a basis for custody and eventual deportation.”). The respondent had already received three continuances over a period of 5 months within which time he was unsuccessful in his collateral attack of his criminal conviction (Tr. at 6), and the Immigration Judge considered that it would be speculative that the respondent would be successful in the appeal of the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus (Tr. at 6-7). See Baires v. INS, 856 F.2d 89, 91, 92-93 (9th Cir. 1988) (discussing factors the Immigration Judge must consider when adjudicating a request for a continuance).
 
In addition, we note that approximately 3 months have elapsed since the Immigration Judge rendered his decision in this matter, and we have yet to receive any indication from the respondent that he has prevailed in his collateral criminal proceedings. Consequently, as observed above, no purpose other than an unnecessary delay of the proceedings would be served by a further continuance, and the Immigration Judge exercised sound discretion in denying the request. See Matter of Sibrun, supra at 356-57. Therefore, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision not to allow the respondent a further continuance to collaterally challenge the conviction. Because the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the respondent’s request for a further continuance, his appellate claim of a due process violation fails. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a procedural due process challenge to deportation proceedings, alien must show error and substantial prejudice).
 
*4 The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that he is not inadmissible under sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, and is subject to removal from the United States based on the conviction record submitted in this case (Exhs. 2, 3). See section 240(c)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(2)(A). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Omar Cura, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anibal D. Martinez
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2005, order finding him removable, deeming his application for relief to be abandoned, and ordering him removed to Pakistan. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
At proceedings held on June 14, 2005, the respondent conceded removability as charged (Tr. at 15-16), and was directed by the Immigration Judge to file his application for relief in compliance with local procedures, noting that the court required strict adherence to those procedures. The Immigration Judge asked if there were any questions. Neither the respondent nor his counsel raised any questions concerning the court’s filing requirements. Nevertheless, the respondent’s application was not timely filed, and the Immigration Judge cancelled the merits hearing and entered an order of removal.
 
The respondent’s notice of appeal and brief list several explanations for the failure to timely file the application. One explanation was that there was bad advice from the clerk’s office as to when the application could be filed. This explanation was proffered in the form of a statement by counsel. Statements or assertions by counsel are not evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). Nothing else has been submitted to support the respondent’s claim in this regard.
 
Counsel for the respondent further claims that the filing was too complex to be successfully accomplished in a timely fashion. The record does not support this claim. The transcript of record makes it clear that the Immigration Judge provided an opportunity for questions about filing and no objection was made to the scheduling of the merits hearing (Tr. at 17-18). It is clear from the record that the respondent did not object to the filing deadline.
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge caused the filing to be late by arbitrarily rejecting the filed application for minor technical reasons, such as counsel’s failure to mark the box indicating he was not subject to disciplinary procedures. The assertion that any action of the Immigration Judge caused the application to be late is not supported by the record. The respondent also argues that he should not suffer from his counsel’s mistakes. However, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim has not been made. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the procedure for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*2 In sum, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the application was abandoned. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (providing that an Immigration Judge may set reasonable time limits for the filing of applications and the failure to file within the time set means the opportunity to file is deemed waived); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549-50 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Neil F. Lewis, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge decision denying her request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). She has also requested that we remand the record due to ineffective assistance of her previous counsel, for the presentation of new and material evidence, and based on her argument that the Notice to Appear was improper. The appeal will be sustained in part and the record remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent has for the most part compiled with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id at 640. While it is not entirely clear from the record whether the respondent’s previous attorney acted ineffectively to such an extent as to prejudice the respondent, the respondent has now presented significant additional evidence, some of which could have been produced at the previous hearing, perhaps indicating ineffective assistance, and some of which was unavailable, requiring that the record be remanded for consideration of the new evidence. In particular, we note the possible lapse of judgement on the part of previous counsel in not calling the respondent’s United States citizen husband to testify on the respondent’s behalf although he was present at the time. It appears he will suffer meaningful hardship were the respondent to be removed from the United States, a factor only briefly considered by the Immigration Judge in his decision. We also note that although the respondent, through previous counsel, admitted to the allegations against her, the charging document does, in fact, indicate an incorrect statute under which she was convicted.
 
*2 Given the problems outlined above, we find we should remand the record for further consideration of the respondent’s removability and her application for cancellation of removal.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE O-S-G-, RESPONDENT
Decided December 6, 2006
**1 *56 A motion to reconsider a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals must include the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority; (2) in the case of an affirmance without opinion (“AWO”), a showing that the alleged errors and legal arguments were previously raised on appeal and a statement explaining how the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision under the AWO regulations; and (3) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Brad Alexander, Esquire,
Miami, Florida
BEFORE: Board Panel: OSUNA, Acting Chairman; HOLMES and FILPPU, Board Members.
OSUNA, Acting Chairman:
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2006), the respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision dated June 13, 2006, in which a Board Member summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge. In his motion to reconsider, the respondent restates in general terms his prior arguments and asserts for the first time that he will be persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group. This latter claim was not raised in his Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589), at the hearing before the Immigration Judge, or in his brief on appeal. The respondent does not allege any factual or legal error in our prior order under the summary affirmance regulations. Nor does he refer to new legal authority that materially affects his case. The motion to reconsider will therefore be denied.
  
I. MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER
 
By statute and regulation, a motion to reconsider must state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in a prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the *57 Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229a(c)(6)(C) (West 2005);1 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).2 Only one motion to reconsider any given decision may be submitted, and it must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of the Board’s decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). In removal proceedings an alien may file only one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the United States, and the motion must be filed within 30 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal. Sections 240(c)(6)(A), (B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).3 A party may not file a motion to reconsider a previously denied motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). A motion to reconsider is also barred if it is filed solely to challenge a decision to affirm without opinion by a single Board Member, or to adjudicate the case without a panel of three Board Members. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(3). However, we still retain authority at any time to reconsider on our own motion any case in which we have rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In addition, we have authority to deny a motion to reconsider as a matter of discretion. Id.
 
**2 A motion to reconsider is a “‘request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.”’ Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002) (quoting Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991)). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Matter of Cerna, supra, at 402. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion *58 to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Id. at 403; see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
A motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216, 219 (BIA 1990, 1991) (“Arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) A motion to reconsider is not a mechanism by which a party may file a new brief before the Board raising additional legal arguments that are unrelated to those issues raised before the Immigration Judge and on appeal. Rather, the “additional legal arguments” that may be raised in a motion to reconsider should flow from new law or a de novo legal determination reached by the Board in its decision that may not have been addressed by the parties. Similarly, a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal and seek reconsideration by generally alleging error in the prior Board decision. The moving party must specify the factual and legal issues raised on appeal that were decided in error or overlooked in our initial decision or must show how a change in law materially affects our prior decision. For example, reconsideration may be granted if a movant informs us that a particular aspect of the case, already raised or addressed during the hearing, was not considered in adjudicating the appeal, see, e.g., Matter of Ramos, supra, or if an argument raised in the brief was overlooked at the time we entered our decision, see, e.g., Matter of Robles, 24 I&N Dec. 22 (BIA 2006).
  
II. STANDARDS FOR A MOTION TO RECONSIDER A DECISION TO AFFIRM WITHOUT OPINION
 
In 2002 the Attorney General enacted regulations to streamline case management at the Board. See Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms To Improve Case Management, 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878 (Aug. 26, 2002); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (2006). These reform regulations included the expanded use of decisions by a single Board Member. The regulations permit a single Board Member to decide a case by use of a summary affirmance order, otherwise known as an affirmance without opinion or “AWO.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4). By regulation, an AWO must state the following: “The Board affirms, without opinion, the result of the decision below. The decision below is, therefore, the final agency determination. See 8 CFR 3.1(e)(4).” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(ii).4
 
**3 *59 The regulations regarding the use of an AWO state that a Board Member shall affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge without opinion if three conditions are met. First, the Board Member must determine that the result reached in the decision under review was correct. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(i). Second, the Board Member must conclude that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial. Id. Third, the Board Member must find that
(A) The issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation; or
 
(B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.
 
Id. (emphasis added). While the regulations bar a motion to reconsider solely on the management decision to issue an AWO by a single Board Member, a party may still move to reconsider the underlying reasons for the affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision, if appropriate. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(3).
 
In order to properly seek reconsideration of a summary affirmance order, the moving party should set forth the reasons the Board erred in concluding that the Immigration Judge’s decision was correct. The motion should identify the material errors in the underlying Immigration Judge’s decision, if any, that were overlooked by the Board and that ultimately affected the disposition of the appeal. In the event there is a change in law, the movant should identify the precedent, statute, or regulation at issue and show how the change materially affects the outcome of the case. Similarly, if the Board overlooked controlling precedent, the motion should state succinctly which issues that were raised on appeal involved such precedent, and how the case law changes the outcome of the case. In addition, the movant must show that the factual or legal issues that were raised on appeal were substantial and should have been considered, and the movant must explain how the issues, if addressed, would have changed the disposition of the appeal. A motion to reconsider an AWO that fails to address these factors, as applicable, will be denied for failure to sufficiently articulate the reasons for reconsideration.
  
III. APPLICATION
 
In the instant case the respondent is seeking reconsideration of our summary affirmance order. The motion to reconsider essentially sets forth two bases for reconsideration. First, the motion reiterates the argument first raised on appeal that the respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution *60 based on political opinion. It does so, however, in very general terms, essentially by setting forth legal propositions without a detailed discussion of how those propositions apply to the respondent. Second, the respondent requests that we reconsider the summary affirmance in light of a completely new legal claim-that he was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his alleged membership in a particular social group. He contends that this “additional legal argument” may properly be presented in a motion to reconsider. We disagree.
 
**4 The respondent failed to assert his claim regarding membership in a particular social group in either his Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal or during the hearing before the Immigration Judge. Likewise, he did not raise this issue on appeal. Thus, the motion to reconsider fails to identify a material issue that was overlooked by the Board in affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge. Indeed, the motion to reconsider does not point to any material error in the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
Furthermore, the motion to reconsider does not allege that the issues, as raised on appeal, involved the application of precedent to a novel situation, or that there is new precedent or a change in law that affects our prior decision. The respondent has also not asserted any new facts or provided new evidence for our consideration that would convert his motion to reconsider into a motion to reopen. Instead, the respondent generally reiterates prior arguments and raises completely new legal arguments, which were not previously raised either before the Immigration Judge or on appeal, and which are based on the same factual record. See Matter of Medrano, supra. As noted above, a motion to reconsider must include specific allegations as to how the Board erred as a matter of fact or law in its AWO decision, and it must be supported by pertinent legal authority. Because the respondent has failed to raise such allegations of error in his motion to reconsider, we will deny the motion.
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
In conclusion, we find that a motion to reconsider should, consistent with the statute and regulations set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b), include the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the Board’s decision that is supported by pertinent authority; (2) if the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, a showing that the alleged errors and legal arguments were previously raised on appeal and a statement explaining how the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision under the AWO regulations; and (3) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. We find that the respondent’s motion fails to assert any factual or *61 legal errors in our prior decision under the AWO regulations. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

The statutory provisions regarding motions to reopen and reconsider were previously found at sections 240(c)(5) and (6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(5) and (6) (2000). However, those sections were recently redesignated as sections 240(c)(6) and (7) of the Act by section 101(d)(1) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Division B of Pub. L. No. 109-13, 110 Stat. 302, 304.

2

Although the Attorney General’s authority to entertain motions in removal proceedings is now authorized by statute, prior to 1996 the authority to consider motions derived solely by regulation. See sections 240(c)(6) and (7) of the Act; INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 140-41 (1981). In addition to the provisions of the statute and the regulations, a number of precedent decisions provide guidance on the filing of substantive motions. See, e.g., Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec. 899 (BIA 2006) (reopening for asylum based on a change in circumstances and country conditions); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (reopening for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of removal proceedings); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).

3

We observe that the statute and the regulations regarding motions to reconsider before the Board and the Immigration Judges contain slightly different language, which does not affect the disposition of this motion. Compare sections 240(c)(6)(A), (B) of the Act with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2006). See generally Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5 (BIA 2001); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

4

Although the regulations relating to the Board’s adjudication of immigration matters have been transferred from 8 C.F.R. part 3 to part 1003, the citation to 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(e)(4) in the AWO regulation has not been amended to reflect that change. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.0 (2006); Aliens and Nationality; Homeland Security; Reorganization of Regulations, 68 Fed. Reg. 9824, 9826, 9830 (Feb. 28, 2003); 67 Fed. Reg. at 54,903.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Louis A. Gordon, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver; adjustment of status; remand
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 18, 2005. During the pendency of this appeal he also filed a motion to reopen and remand. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly relied on our decision in Matter of Blake, 23 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 2005), in concluding that the respondent is ineligible for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996). Thus we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
The respondent’s motion to remand will be denied. A motion to reopen which is filed with the Board must, among other things, state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Even where prima facie eligibility is shown, a motion to reopen may be denied as a matter of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). An alien filing a motion to reopen (or a motion to remand which is in the nature of a motion to reopen) is subject to the difficult standards for a motion for rehearing; even a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief may be insufficient. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent seeks a remand based on his submission of documents relating to an approved visa petition, including a copy of an approval notice (Form I-797, Notice of Action) indicating that the respondent’s immigration petition as a parent of a U.S. citizen had been approved on August 30, 2006.
 
We note that the respondent may be theoretically eligible to apply for relief at this time. See, e.g. Matter of Azurin, 23 I&N Dec. 695 (BIA 2005). However, in the context of this case, the respondent has not established any discretionary considerations which justify the delay which would be caused by further proceedings. As stated above, prima facie eligibility for relief is not necessarily sufficient for reopening. The evidence of positive equities presented in this case is insufficiently strong to overcome the uncontested negative factors. These negative factors include the respondent’s conviction on two counts for a serious criminal offense. Following the general standards for reopening of proceedings, we see no basis on which to grant the motion to remand.
 
*2 In making this determination, we also conclude that there was no violence due process in the Immigration Judge’ denial of a continuance. First, the delay in the respondent’s application for a visa petition and/or naturalization, as it stood at the time of the hearing below, was attributable to the respondent and not to governmental inaction or an unfair administrative delay. Thus, that discretionary factor in favor of a continuance was not present. The Immigration Judge considered a variety of evidence before reaching his discretionary conclusion not to grant the continuance. We conclude there was no abuse of discretion in that denial. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29.
 
The respondent objects to the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that documents from his bond hearings could not be considered in removal proceedings, and also objects to the Immigration Judge’s conclusions regarding the lack of reliability of fingerprints taken in the office of the respondent’s attorney.1 The respondent cites no persuasive authority that these actions of the Immigration Judge were an abuse of discretion, and we conclude, upon review of the record, that the Immigration Judge did not violate the respondent’s due process rights. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.10.
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel associated with the failure to timely comply with filing background information. See Respondent’s Br. at 25. First, it has not been established that the respondent’s former attorney prevented him from compliance with the written instructions on fingerprinting requirements. See I.J. at 7. Second, the respondent has not shown that a continuance should have been granted in the absence of the alleged ineffective assistance. We conclude that the respondent’s due process right to assistance of counsel was not violated because he was not prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1985).
 
In sum, we have considered the arguments raised on appeal and in support of the motion to reopen, and find no basis to sustain the appeal or grant the motion. Consequently the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening; motion to remand
 
This matter was last before the Board on July 22, 2005, when we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the respondent’s appeal from a decision of an Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings and to rescind the in absentia order of deportation entered against him on October 11, 1996. The respondent sought review by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the Court). In a decision issued on June 26, 2006, the Court vacated our July 22, 2005, decision and remanded the matter for consideration of the merits of the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen proceedings. Subsequently, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Court to consider his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to remand will be denied.1
 
We adopt and affirm the December 23, 2004, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings and to rescind the in absentia order of deportation entered against him on October 11, 1996. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in December 2004, alleging that he did not receive notice of his October 11, 1996, hearing. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was provided adequate and actual notice of his October 11, 1996, hearing, having personally signed for the receipt of such notice. Likewise, the respondent failed to file a timely motion to reopen on the basis of exceptional circumstances excusing his failure to attend the deportation hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii). Consequently, entry of an in absentia order of deportation on October 1, 1996, was appropriate.
 
The respondent requests that the record be remanded to the Immigration Court, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge in conjunction with the filing of his motion to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of deportation. Specifically, the respondent claims that his former counsel failed to argue before the Immigration Judge that the in absentia order of deportation was defective in that it was entered in reliance on an order to show cause which was based on allegations of fact and law not relating to the respondent. However, despite having been provided actual notice, the respondent failed to attend the October 11, 1996, hearing and to contest the charges of deportation which had been brought against him. As such, an attorney’s failure to contest the charges of deportability in the context of an untimely motion to reopen, which had been filed more than seven years after an entry of the in absentia order of deportation, does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii). Likewise, the respondent has not raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel who may have represented him during the proceedings leading to and culminating in the entry of the in absentia order of deportation on October 11, 1996. Consequently, we find no basis upon which the respondent’s motion to remand may be granted. In view of the foregoing, the following orders shall be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea Guerrero, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Mubaraki
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
This matter was last before the Board on May 24, 2006, when we granted the respondent’s motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that order, we noted that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not oppose the motion. The DHS has filed a timely motion to reconsider contending that it did indeed oppose the respondent’s motion, as reflected in its “Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen” (“Opposition”) dated April 24, 2006. The respondent opposes the motion to reconsider.
 
Notwithstanding the parties’ differing views on whether the DHS’ April 24, 2006, Opposition was properly filed and should now be considered, we have decided to grant the DHS’ request for reconsideration of our May 24, 2006, decision. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is granted. Upon reconsideration, we once again grant the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
We have reviewed the material submitted in conjunction with the respondent’s motion to reopen and find that he has satisfied all of the requirements, as discussed in Matter of Lozada, supra, for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney. Further, we observe that at the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge on February 7, 2005, (when he was represented by his former attorney), the respondent had already lived in the United States for over 15 1/2 years and had four qualifying relatives, including his lawful permanent resident mother and three United States citizen children. At a minimum, these facts warranted a discussion between the respondent and his attorney as to whether he could qualify for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent maintains that his former attorney never advised him of the availability of such relief in his case. As such the line of inquiry regarding the relevant hardship facts was cut off. The failure of the respondent’s former counsel to inform the respondent even of the possibility of section 240A(b) relief in his case amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Nothing in the DHS’ Opposition persuades us to deny the respondent’s Lozada motion. The DHS asserts that the respondent’s former attorney simply concluded that the respondent could not demonstrate the necessary degree of hardship for purposes of establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal, particularly given that many of the hardship factors set forth in the respondent’s motion did not exist at the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge. This argument fails because it is purely conjectural in nature. There is no statement from the respondent’s former attorney in the record, and therefore there is no basis for determining what he concluded about the respondent’s eligibility for cancellation of removal. Further, there has been no showing that the respondent’s former attorney ever informed him of the option of applying for cancellation of removal, much less discussed with him the specific elements for demonstrating eligibility for such relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The DHS’ motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen filed with this Board April 7, 2006, is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of his removal order is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rev. Robert Vitaglione,
Accredited Representative
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A) (iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. In a decision dated August 24, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), based on his record of conviction. See Exh. 4. The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for relief from removal due to his aggravated felony drug trafficking conviction.1 The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Ecuador. The respondent appealed.2 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We find no merit to the contentions raised by the respondent on appeal. At the outset, even if we were to accept the respondent’s assertion that the attorney at his criminal trial did not explain the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, he has not demonstrated that his counsel’s actions were objectively unreasonable so as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of due process, undermining the validity of the respondent’s 2004 New York State aggravated felony drug trafficking conviction (Exh. 4) upon which the charges of removability are premised. See Eze v. Senkowski, 321 F. 3d 110, 123 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting the US Supreme Court’s decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984) as to the standards required for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a criminal proceeding.). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that “an attorney’s failure to inform a client of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, without more, does not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.” United States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 187 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing United States v. Santelises (Santelises II), 509 F.2d 703, 704 (2d Cir. 1975) (noting that an attorney’s failure to inform a defendant that a guilty plea could result in deportation “is of no legal significance”)); see also United States v. Salerno, 66 F. 3d 544, 550-51 (2d Cir. 1995) (court held that an attorney’s failure to advise client as to collateral consequences of a plea does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 However, the Second Circuit in Couto also indicated “that an attorney’s affirmative misrepresentation as to the deportation consequences of a guilty plea is … objectively unreasonable” so that it may constitute ineffective assistance. See Id. at 188. Nonetheless, in the matter before us, the respondent contends only that he was not advised of the potential adverse consequences of his guilty plea and not that he was wrongly informed by his attorney. See also United States v. Santelises (Santelises I), 476 F.2d 787, 789-90 (2d Cir. 1973) (no ineffective assistance claim where the defendant “does not allege that he was affirmatively misled by his counsel”).
 
In addition, as to the respondent’s appellate contention that if not the attorney, the court is obligated under section 220.50(7) of the New York Criminal Procedure Law to inform the criminal defendant as to the possible immigration consequences of his plea, we note that in interpreting that section, a New York Court in People v. McDonald, 296 A.D.2d 13, 745 N.Y.S.2d 276 (3d Dept.2002), affd. 1 N.Y.3d 109, 769 N.Y.S.2d 781, 802 N.E.2d 131 (2003), found that “NYCPL ¿sectionº 220.50(7) while mandating that the trial court, prior to accepting a plea of guilty to certain felonies, advise a defendant that if he or she is not a U.S. citizen his or her plea and the court’s acceptance of it may result in, inter alia, the defendant’s deportation-expressly provides that failure of the court to so advise a defendant ‘shall not be deemed to affect the voluntariness of a plea of guilty or the validity of a conviction’.”
 
Notwithstanding, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the Immigration Court is not the proper forum to litigate this issue (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge and this Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Fortis, 14 I & N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974). We also observe that a conviction is deemed final when all direct appeals have been exhausted or waived.3 See Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N 546 (BIA 1988). In addition, the pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks, not constituting direct appeals, does not serve to negate the finality of the convictions or the charge of deportability, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to that motion. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 1993); see also Okabe v. INS, 671 F.2d 863 (5th Cir. 1982); Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, 516 F.2d 565 (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1050 (1976). Furthermore, the respondent is precluded from collaterally attacking his criminal record of conviction in a deportation proceeding. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085 (9th Cir. 1993).
 
*3 The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the conviction record submitted in this case (Exh. 4). See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). Furthermore, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The record reflects that on February 26, 2004, the respondent was convicted in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, for the offense of Criminal Sale of a Controlled Substance in the Second Degree (2 counts) to wit: cocaine, in violation of section 220.41 of the New York State Penal Law. The respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years to life for each offense to run concurrently (Exh. 4).

2

The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3) (2006). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).

The Immigration Judge considered that pursuant to New York State Criminal Procedure Law, the respondent had the following options with regard to “allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel; to either file a direct appeal within 30 days of his conviction under New York State CPL section 460.10, or to file a 440 motion at any time under New York State CPL section 440.10 (I.J at 2-3).” The Immigration Judge noted, however, the respondent’s direct appeal was dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York on April 7, 2005 (Tr. at 14), and the respondent has provided no evidence of the filing of a 440 motion in the 2 1/2 years since his conviction (Tr. at 27). See I.J at 3.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was before the Board last on January 17, 2006, when we summarily affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s oral decision entered on October 5, 2005. In that oral decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged based on his admissions (Tr. at 20) and record of conviction (Exh. 6); found him ineligible for relief due to his 2004 California controlled substance conviction, and ordered him removed from the United States to the Philippines. On September 29, 2006, the respondent filed a motion seeking sua sponte reopening alleging ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him in the criminal proceedings below and indicating that he has submitted a habeas corpus petition seeking to vacate his 2004 California controlled substance conviction, which is currently pending before the California courts. The motion will be denied.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on January 17, 2006. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before April 17, 2006. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the respondent’s motion until September 29, 2006. As such, it is untimely filed and not properly before us for consideration.
 
The respondent has asked that we accept this motion sua sponte. This we decline to do. The respondent indicated in his motion that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied his petition for review and motion for a stay of removal of the Board’s order on July 24, 2006. He also alleges in his motion that he filed a habeas corpus petition on August 6, 2006. However, the respondent has offered no explanation as to why he waited another two months after the Ninth Circuit’s decision in order to file his motion with the Board. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (The Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Notwithstanding, even if it had been timely submitted, the motion would be denied. We note that an Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding her guilt or innocence. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). We also observe that a conviction is deemed final when all direct appeals have been exhausted or waived. See Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N 546 (BIA 1988). The pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks, not constituting direct appeals, does not serve to negate the finality of the convictions or the charge of deportability, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to that motion. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 1993). In addition, the respondent is precluded from collaterally attacking his criminal record of conviction in a deportation proceeding. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085 (9th Cir. 1993).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied. Furthermore, in view of our disposition of the respondent’s motion, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal will also be denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Lopez-Wilson, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 14, 2006, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear at the hearing on June 5, 2000. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he did not receive notice of his hearing. He claims that the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was mailed to an address where the respondent allegedly lived, but he never received any notice of the hearing. The respondent submitted an affidavit with his motion to reopen, in which he states that one day prior to his hearing he contacted his former attorney and he was informed of his scheduled hearing date. However, he indicates that he did not have the hearing notice with him, and therefore, he was unable to find the Immigration Court in Dallas, Texas. He claims that a guard at one of the downtown buildings in Dallas told him to wait for another appointment letter. The respondent requests that the proceedings be reopened based on lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also claims that he is eligible for asylum and he has an approved visa petition that was filed on his behalf by his brother.
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent on November 28, 1999, and he was informed in the Spanish language of the consequences of a failure to appear. The respondent also signed the Notice to Appear acknowledging his receipt of it. On April 6, 2000, the hearing notice was sent to the respondent’s former attorney of record, Thelma O. Garcia. The Immigration Judge noted that on the day of the respondent’s master calendar hearing, June 5, 2000, the Immigration Court received a motion to withdraw as attorney of record from Ms. Garcia. The Immigration Judge indicates that he denied Ms. Garcia’s request to withdraw as the attorney of record, and he formally singed the denial order on June 6, 2000. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear on June 5, 2000.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that the notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s former attorney of record on April 6, 2000. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Moreover, the respondent indicates that he was aware of his scheduled heating on June 5, 2000, but he was unable to locate the Dallas Immigration Court on the day of the hearing. On appeal the respondent asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, he has not complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We find that based upon the evidence of record, the respondent received notice of the hearing in accordance with the Act, and he has not met the burden of demonstrating lack of notice under the statute. The respondent also has not established that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the statutory requirement that motion to reopen be filed within 180 days of in absentia order). Nor has the respondent explained why he did not seek reopening until almost six years after being ordered removed in absentia. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge Rodriguez-Choi, Esquire
*1 This case is before us on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In its December 22, 2005, unpublished decision, Uribe v. Gonzales, 163 Fed. Appx. 462, 2005 WL 3525616 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2005) (unpublished), the court found that, in a December 29, 2003, decision, we erred in considering the respondent’s motion to reopen.1
 
First, we note that we provided counsel for the respondent, and the government, time to make submissions concerning the court’s remand order. The respondent submitted a brief, but the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) did not file a brief concerning the remand order.
 
The respondent sought reopening to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(2), as a battered spouse.2 She contended that her former attorney, Walter Pineda, failed to submit an application for cancellation of removal to the Immigration Judge, which resulted, in the Immigration Judge and Board’s determinations that the application had been abandoned. We found, in our December 29, 2003, order, that the respondent presented insufficient evidence from which to conclude that the respondent informed Pineda that she claimed to be a battered spouse.
 
The Ninth Circuit determined that we erred in our analysis: “The BIA should have focused on the conduct of counsel… instead the BIA improperly focused on what Uribe failed to do. Uribe’s communications or lack thereof may be relevant to assessing the conduct of counsel, but it is the conduct of counsel upon which the BIA must focus its lens of examination to resolve a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Uribe v. Gonzales, supra, at 465. Yet in our December 29, 2003, decision, we considered Pineda’s contention that the respondent did not tell him that she claimed to be a battered spouse. The Ninth Circuit implicitly finds that, nevertheless, Pineda “lacked a reason” for not filing the cancellation application. Id. Therefore, we will remand the case to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent may present her application for relief.
 
The Ninth Circuit also found that the Board erred by not considering whether a second attorney, Mashiur Chowdhury, provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to submit a timely petition for review concerning our April 9, 2002, decision. Uribe v. Gonzales, supra, at 466. This decision grants the respondent the relief that she seeks, the chance to present her application for cancellation of removal, and furthermore vacates our April 9, 2002, final order in light of the Ninth Circuit’s remand order. Given these fundamental changes in the respondent’s case, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit would not find it necessary for the Board to address the respondent’s contentions concerning Chowdhury.
 
*2 ORDER: Our decisions of April 9, 2002, December 29, 2003, and June 3, 2004, are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the immigration court in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present her application for cancellation of removal to the Immigration Judge.

We also declined to reconsider our December 29, 2003, decision on June 3, 2004. The Ninth Circuit found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider that order, as the respondent did not file a petition for review concerning that order. Uribe v. Gonzales, supra, at fn. 2.

2

The Ninth Circuit found that we erred by not considering the respondent’s argument that the time deadline for filing a motion to reopen should be tolled, when we concluded that the motion to reopen was untimely filed. Uribe v. Gonzales, supra, at 464. However, we stated in our June 3, 2004, decision, that “without explicitly addressing whether ‘equitable tolling’ is appropriate in this case, the Board was willing to assume, arguendo, that the motion should be considered notwithstanding its lateness.”

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gloria Lopez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Harold K. Pickering
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen is untimely and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on January 4, 2006. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no liner than 90 days after the date of that decision. Thus, a motion to reopen would have been due by April 4, 2006. The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue our prior decision was received by the Board on May 17, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion.
 
The respondent urges that the Board should reissue its decision because neither he nor his representative at the time of the Board’s January 4, 2006, decision received that order. We decline to reissue our decision, where no error has been identified in our service of the decision. A review of the record shows that the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) pro se, and provided his mailing address at that time. The record also reflects that on July 22, 2005, attorney Parmjeet Kaur Randhawa submitted a request to extend the respondent’s briefing schedule. The Board granted that request on July 25, 2005, sending a copy to both attorney Kaur Randhawa and the respondent, but notified both of them at that time that if the respondent wished an attorney to represent him on appeal a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Board (Form EOIR-27) must be filed by the attorney. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(g). Although attorney Kaur Randhawa contends in the written declaration she submitted in conjunction with the motion that she submitted an EOIR-27, she has submitted no evidence of such a submission and we find nothing in the record to indicate the Board received an EOIR-27 from her prior to the issuance of our January 2006 decision. The only EOIR-27 from attorney Kaur Randhawa contained in the record is that which was submitted in conjunction with the motion to reissue on May 17, 2006. Consequently, the Board’s decision was properly mailed to the respondent at the address he provided on the Notice of Appeal, since no attorney had filed an EOIR-27 as his representative. 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
The respondent also states in his written declaration that he did not receive the Board’s decision, and that he moved to another address on January 15, 2006. The Board’s January 4, 2006, decision was mailed to the respondent at the address he provided on the Notice of Appeal, which is where he was admittedly still residing on that date. In addition, it was not returned by the United States Postal Service as undeliverable. Moreover, the respondent does not indicate that he submitted a Change of Address Form (Form EOIR-33) within 5 days of his move, as instructed on the Notice of Appeal and required by regulation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(e). Thus, the respondent has failed to demonstrate any error in the Board’s service of its January 4, 2006, decision, and it does not appear that any lack of notice was for failure to properly serve the decision. Nor has he demonstrated that the decision should have been served on his prior attorney as his representative, since she did not file an appearance on his behalf prior to the issuance of that decision. Although the respondent is now represented by new counsel and has made vague allegations of error on the part of his prior attorney, he has not clearly stated a case for ineffective assistance of counsel, and we further point out that the Board’s decision was properly mailed to him at the address he provided to the Board. Thus, any ineffective assistance is not directly relevant to whether the Board’s decision should be reissued. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Osei Prempeh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cathy Auble
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a Citizen of Ghana, was ordered removed from the United States on February 3, 2005, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on August 2, 2005, but the Immigration Judge denied the request on August 22, 2005. That decision was not appealed to the Board. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on March 28, 2006. The motion was denied on May 3, 2006, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argued in his second motion to reopen and on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened because he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. According to the respondent, his prior attorney neglected to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his first motion to reopen, and thereby denied him due process in these proceedings.
 
The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia. The respondent’s second motion to reopen is numerically-barred from consideration. In addition, we note that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent at 1885 S. Quebec Way, #1-25, Denver, Colorado 80231, but was returned to the Immigration Court because the respondent no longer resided at the address. We further note that the respondent received the Notice to Appear at that address on November 2, 2004, and apparently changed his address thereafter, but did not notify the Immigration Court of the change. We therefore find that the respondent was properly notified of the hearing. Having found that the respondent received proper notice of the hearing, we find that the respondent has not suffered prejudice on account of his first counsel’s alleged failure to appeal the denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
Additionally, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, supra, and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988); see also Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 127 F.3d 833 (10th Cir. 2005) (recognizing requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with Board). The respondent has provided no proof that his prior counsel was notified of the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, and provided an opportunity to respond to the respondent’s second motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge’s decision is also incorporated into this order, and is affirmed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lina T. Hernandez,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 27, 2006. The respondent failed to appear for her hearing on March 10, 2004. She was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. Nearly 2 years later, on January 4, 2006, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen based on a lack of notice. She claimed that she informed her former attorney of her change of address, but the Notice to Appear was sent to her prior address and she did not receive it. She stated that the illness of one relative in 2001, and the death of another in 2002, caused her to lack involvement with her immigration matters, and are exceptional circumstances. The respondent said that she was not aware that her former counsel had withdrawn her application for adjustment of status. She claimed that she is eligible for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent did not inform the Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) of her change of address, and found that the Notice to Appear and the hearing notice were properly sent to her last known address. The Immigration Judge found no connection between the respondent’s failure to appear in 2004, and the illness of her relative commencing in 2001, or the death of another relative in 2002. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had not demonstrated that she was prevented from appearing due to exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims ineffective assistance from both the attorney who represented her on her motion to reopen and from her former attorney. The respondent has not presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She has not shown that the attorneys whose integrity or competence is being impugned have been informed of the allegations leveled against them and given an opportunity to respond. Further, the respondent has not shown that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of the counsels’ ethical or legal responsibilities, and why such a complaint or complaints have not been filed. The Immigration Judge appropriately denied reopening. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bruce G. Davis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathleen L. Alcorn
Chief Counsel
*1 On May 17, 2006, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure in lieu of removal. The respondent has appealed. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent is married to a United States citizen. The respondent alleges that she and her husband contracted with her former attorney, Mr. Casterline, to file a petition for an immediate relative visa on her behalf. The respondent further alleges that although the immigration Judge granted her several continuances so that Mr. Casterline could file the petition, he failed to do so, and, as a consequence, she was told to accept voluntary departure in lieu of removal. Faced with an order of removal, the respondent claims that she accepted voluntary departure. The order granting voluntary departure indicates that appeal was waived.
 
The respondent filed an appeal on June 16, 2006, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also filed a motion to reopen and remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003).
 
In addition, by joint motion filed August 22, 2006, current counsel for the respondent and Chief Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) request a remand for evidentiary hearing on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. If the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, her waiver may not have been knowing and intelligent so we would have jurisdiction to reopen and remand. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). Further, a joint motion to reopen is not subject to the time and number limitations of a motion to reopen whether filed with the Board or the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iv).
 
In light of the joint motion, as well as the respondent’s compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, we find that the Immigration Judge should consider the respondent’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board resolves the appeal in this case. On remand, the parties should present their request for a subpoena to the Immigration Judge. The record will therefore be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated in this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Husein A. Abdelhadi, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on May 11, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s March 30, 2005, motion to reopen. On October 4, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion in which he asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion and to reissue our March 14, 2005, decision so that he can file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. For the reasons stated below, the motion will be denied.
 
First, we consider the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) (an alien may file one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions not relevant here, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). The final administrative decision in this case was issued on March 14, 2005. This is the respondent’s second motion to reopen.
 
The respondent asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent alleges that his prior attorney, Mr. Anthony Osei, never informed him that he could file a petition for review of our March 14, 2005, order in federal court. The respondent also alleges that because Mr. Osei failed to timely file a writ of habeas corpus in federal court after the issuance of our May 11, 2005, decision, he lost his opportunity to seek judicial review of our order. The respondent complied with the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
On October 18, 2006, we received Mr. Osei’s response to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Mr. Osei adamantly denies the respondent’s allegations of misconduct. First, Mr. Osei explains that the respondent was properly informed of his options after this Board dismissed his appeal. According to the fee receipts, the respondent paid $600 in legal fees for a motion to reopen and he paid the $110 filing fees. Compare Mr. Osei’s Affidavit and Attachments F and G with Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7-8, and Attachments A and B. Second, Mr. Osei emphatically denies that he ever directed, prepared or filed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the respondent. He also asserts that he was never paid to prepare such a filing. Compare Mr. Osei’s Affidavit at 4 with Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8 and Attachments A, B and E. Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that would support sua sponte reopening.
 
*2 The respondent has also asked us to reissue our March 14, 2005, decision so he can seek review in federal court. The respondent has failed to show that a reissued decision is warranted in this case. Notably, the respondent does not allege that Mr. Osei failed to notify him of our decision, or that Board did not properly mail the decision to Mr. Osei, or that Mr. Osei did not receive the Board’s decision. Rather, the respondent argues that given his counsel’s ineffective assistance, this is the only way to properly remedy the case. See Respondent’s Motion at 13. As noted above, on the basis of the record before us, we cannot find that Mr. Osei’s assistance was ineffective. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reissue will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent moves to reopen our October 27, 2005, decision summarily, dismissing his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security, (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on January 25, 2006, since the final administrative decision was issued on October 27, 2005. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The respondent contends that his criminal conviction was not final; however, the DHS points out that the documentation provided by the respondent does not establish that his conviction is on direct appeal. The DHS observes that the respondent has instead filed a motion for post-conviction relief. The mere availability of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attack does not affect the finality of the conviction. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 157 (BIA 1996). See generally Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894, 896 (BIA 1994) (concluding that a conviction is final when the right to direct appeal is exhausted); see also Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-92 (2nd Cir. 1976) (explaining that an alien is not deemed to have been “convicted” of a crime under the Immigration and Nationality Act until the conviction has attained a substantial degree of finality, and such finality does not occur unless and until direct appellate review of the conviction, as contrasted with collateral attack, has been exhausted or waived). We cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction, unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of an alien. Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, but has not established that the deadline for submitting a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 128 (2d Cir.2000)). The court stated in Cekic, “Tolling is available if the alien can demonstrate that (1) his counsel’s conduct violated ¿hisº constitutional right to due process, and (2) the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period ¿ heº seeks to toll.” Id. To make this showing, an alien must demonstrate that he pursued his case “¿fºrom the point at which the ineffective assistance of counsel should have been, or was in fact, discovered.” See id. at 171 (citing Iavorski, 232 F.3d at 135). It is the respondent’s burden to establish that the 90-day deadline should be equitably tolled, but he has not established due diligence. Moreover, the respondent has manifestly failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (B1A), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), wherein we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Duggan, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States because he failed to appear for his hearing scheduled for April 26, 2000. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on June 5, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied it on July 28, 2006. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent does not dispute on appeal that he received the Notice to Appear. He indicates in his affidavit that he moved to Seattle in 1999, mailed a change of address form to the Immigration Court, and was even told by his aunt that a Notice of Hearing was not received on his behalf. He argues that he complied with his obligation to notify the Immigration Court of his address change, and these proceedings should be reopened.
 
We have reviewed the record, and note, as did the Immigration Judge, that a change of address form is not contained therein. We further note that the respondent did not submit a statement from his aunt to corroborate that the respondent lived with her at 1235 S. Sharon Court, #K3, Anaheim, CA 92804, and the respondent’s Notice of Hearing was not received by her at that address. We therefore do not find that the respondent rebutted the presumption that the Notice of Hearing was properly delivered at his last known address. Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002). We further cannot find that the respondent proved that he mailed a change of address form to the Immigration Court immediately after moving to Seattle. We note that the respondent does not indicate in his affidavit the address that he allegedly moved to, and when he moved. We therefore cannot find based on the general representation reflected in the affidavit that the respondent timely notified the Immigration Court of his address change.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsel in these proceedings. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, in Reyes v. Ashcroft,, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003), the court noted that the alien failed to give the prior counsel notice of his motion to reopen. Id. at 1131-1132. The court emphasized that the purpose of Lozada’s notice requirement is to afford the prior counsel an opportunity to contest the allegations of ineffective assistance so that the adjudicator can more accurately assess the claim of ineffective assistance. Id. at 1132.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has failed to submit a complaint against his former attorney with the proper authority, and did not notify him of the allegation of negligence. No explanation for the failure to do so was provided. We further do not find that a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel is present. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9 th Cir. 2000). We cannot find that prior counsel was in any way responsible for the respondent’s failure to appear for the hearing, or materially impeded his right to pursue this appeal. We find that it is appropriate to require compliance with the above requirements. The respondent has not done so, and his request for remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel is denied.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dominick S. Cardinale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Craig A. Harlow,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In an order entered on August 2, 2006, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal by affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent, through different counsel, has filed a motion to reopen, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(1).
 
The respondent argues that his former counsel “failed to properly articulate” the basis for eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility, that he failed to “make any effort to review or reopen the facts” of his criminal case, and that he failed “to properly review and discuss alternative applications for relief.”
 
Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys absent egregious circumstances. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st Cir. 1983): Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case. Mejia Rodriguez v. INS, 178 F.3d 1139 (11th Cir. 1999); Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9 th Cir. 1986).
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by: 1) an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; 2) a showing that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and 3) a showing that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001). The respondent has failed to show that he has complied with the last of these requirements, and so his motion must be denied.
 
Moreover, given the respondent’s circumstances, he is ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to the former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), it is difficult to conceive of an argument that former counsel could have made before the Immigration Judge that would have somehow rendered him eligible for that relief. Neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board is imbued with the authority to “review or reopen the facts” of the respondent’s criminal proceedings, in terms of addressing guilt or innocence, or attacking the conviction. Former counsel’s participation in the respondent’s criminal proceedings is a matter beyond the scope of our jurisdiction.
 
*2 We are aware of no relief from removal for which the respondent would be eligible, so it is unclear how former counsel could have rendered ineffective assistance by not discussing alternative relief. The respondent obviously harbored no fear of harm in Bangladesh, having traveled to that country in 2002 to get married, and again in 2004 for the birth of his child. Given the respondent’s frequent travels to Bangladesh, and the lack of any mention at the hearings about any fear of harm, the Immigration Judge was under no obligation to discuss withholding of removal or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
 
We note that current counsel has represented the respondent at least since April 2006, and counsel submitted an extensive appellate brief on the respondent’s behalf, regarding eligibility for section 212(c) relief. However, no mention was made by either current counsel or the respondent prior to our order of any alleged ineffective assistance. It is unclear why current counsel and the respondent would have waited until after the Board rendered its order to present allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. In any event, those allegations are unavailing.
 
We find no indication of prejudice to the respondent’s case by the quality of representation rendered by his former counsel.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tracy C. Udenwagu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rory H. Potter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on July 20, 2001, when we issued an order affirming the Immigration Judge’s April 5, 1999, decision finding the respondent removable as charged, determining that good cause for a continuance of his proceedings was not demonstrated inasmuch as there was no showing that the immediate relative spousal visa petition a filed in his behalf had been approved, and ordering him removed to his native Nigeria. On March 2, 2006, the respondent filed a motion with this Board seeking to reopen his proceedings so that he may be pursue adjustment of status given that his United States citizen wife has filed a new visa petition in his behalf. He also asserts that he was not effectively represented by counsel in his prior proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely by 4 1/2 years and therefore is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006) (providing that, with certain exceptions not presented here, a motion to reopen must be filed with the Board within 90 days after the mailing of the Board decision). The Board retains limited discretionary powers under the regulations to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte in unique situations where it would serve the interests of justice. However, we have considered the arguments set forth in the respondent’s motion in light of the record before us and have concluded that such reopening is not justified here. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (2006); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent is not currently eligible for adjustment of status. There has been no showing that the visa petition filed February 24, 2006, by his current United States citizen wife, Anthonia Ngozi Monogo, has been approved. This is the second petition filed by Ms. Monogo in the respondent’s behalf. The first petition filed by her on September 30, 1997, was denied by the district director on May 12, 2003,1 pursuant to section 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act given a prior determination by the district director that the respondent’s marriage to his first United States, citizen wife, Reba Adefope, was a sham. See district director decision, May 15, 1996 (denying the visa petition filed by Reba Adefope); Board order, June 6, 1997 (dismissing the petitioner’s appeal of this decision). Both of the district director’s decisions are now final.
 
Further, notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions to the contrary, the circumstances presented here do not fall within the purview of our holding in Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). The instant motion to reopen is untimely and therefore is not properly filed. In addition, the DHS opposes the motion on substantive grounds, and not only because the underlying visa petition has not yet been adjudicated.
 
*2 The respondent also asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his prior proceedings. This claim has not been adequately developed or explained by the respondent. See Respondent’s Motion, p. 2. In any event, he has failed to comply with any of the requirements discussed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for advancing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Lara v. Troiminski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kevin E. Dehghani, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia J. Flanagan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Termination; cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2005, decision sustaining the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), denying the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings, and denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). On appeal, the respondent contests the Immigration Judge’s finding that he is inadmissible as charged, as well as the denial of his application for cancellation of removal. In addition, the respondent seeks remand of proceedings based on the claimed ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. Finally, the respondent seeks remand to allow him to apply to adjust his status. The appeal will be sustained, and removal proceedings terminated.
 
We disagree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to sustain the sole charge of inadmissibility in this matter. Specifically, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s December 19, 1999, conviction in the Superior Court for the State of Connecticut, pursuant to a plea of guilty of violating CONN. GEN. STAT. § 53a-96, which makes it a crime to unlawfully restrain another person, qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude. As noted by the Immigration Judge, restraint is defined in CONN. GEN. STAT. § 53a-91, in pertinent part, as follows:
‘restraint’ means to restrict a person’s movements intentionally and unlawfully in such a manner as to interfere substantially with his liberty by moving him from one place to another, or by confining him either in the place where the restriction commences or any place to which he has been moved, without consent …
 
The Immigration Judge reasoned that because the statute requires that the restrainer act intentionally and unlawfully to interfere with the liberty of another without his consent, it involves a motive that is both vicious and corrupt, and violates the duties owed between persons, and therefore, is a crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of L-V-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 594 (BIA 1999); Matter of Tran, 21 I&N Dec. 291 (BIA 1996). In this regard, the Immigration Judge’s found persuasive the reasoning in the district court case of Sharpe v. Riley, 271 F. Supp.2d 631 (E.D. Pa. 2003), which found that a Pennsylvania statute prohibiting unlawful restraint involved moral turpitude. While the Immigration Judge acknowledged that this case was not binding in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, he found that the Connecticut statute was substantially similar to the Pennsylvania statute, in that it bars the knowing and non-consensual deprivation of the liberty of another, as opposed to accidental or benign conduct or conduct in self-defense, and that a similar analysis was thus appropriate. However, we observe that the Pennsylvania statute at question in Sharpe v. Riley, supra, PENN. CONS. STAT. ANN. § 2902, indicates that unlawful restraint only occurs when a person restrains another unlawfully either in circumstances exposing him to risk of serious bodily injury, or in a condition of involuntary servitude. The district court focused on these additional elements, not on the element of restraint itself, in concluding that the Pennsylvania unlawful restraint statute proscribed conduct which was “contrary to justice, honesty, and morality.” Sharpe v. Riley, supra, at 635. The Connecticut unlawful restraint statute under which the respondent was convicted in the instant matter contains no requirement that the unlawful restraint also expose the restrainee to risk of serious bodily injury, or be held in a condition of involuntary servitude. We note, as does the respondent on appeal, that Connecticut criminalizes unlawful restraint under circumstances which expose such other person to a substantial risk of physical injury under a separate statute, CONN. GEN. STAT. § 53a-95, under which the respondent was neither charged nor convicted. Thus, we find that the Connecticut statute at issue, which merely requires the restraint of another person without his consent, does not involve moral turpitude. Accordingly, we find that the DHS has failed to meet its burden of proving that the respondent is removable based on the charge listed in the Notice to Appear, and disagree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is inadmissible as charged under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. Therefore, we will terminate the respondent’s removal proceedings.
 
*2 In light of our decision to terminate removal proceedings in this matter, we will not address the respondent’s additional arguments relating to ineffective assistance of counsel and the Immigration Judge’s denial of his application for cancellation of removal, or his request for remand of proceedings to apply to adjust his status.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2005, decision is vacated, and removal proceedings against the respondent are terminated.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Idalis Perez-Alvarez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2 to reconsider and reopen our decision dated July 26, 2006. In her motion, the respondent argues that the Board erred in failing to find that she exercised due diligence in filing her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent maintains that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, which prevented her from filing a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. The respondent has submitted additional evidence regarding her allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that the respondent’s arguments in support of her motion fail to establish material error in the Board’s July 26, 2006, decision or that proceedings should be reopened in this matter. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b), (c). In our prior decision, we found that the serious illness of the respondent’s grandfather does not qualify as an “exceptional circumstance,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as the respondent’s grandfather did not qualify as an “immediate relative.” The respondent’s failure to establish exceptional circumstances is a dispositive issue in this matter and the respondent’s arguments regarding ineffective assistance of her counsel in filing her motion to reopen fail to establish that the Board’s conclusion that the illness of her grandfather does not constitute an exceptional circumstance was in error.1 Inasmuch as the respondent has failed to establish error in the Board’s conclusion that the respondent did not meet her burden of proof to establish “exceptional circumstances” for her failure to appear, we decline to reach the respondent’s remaining arguments regarding her former counsel’s failure to exercise due diligence in filing her motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William J. Baker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; waiver of deportability
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 26, 1997, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal, finding the respondent ineligible for relief pursuant to section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent now moves to reopen his case arguing that his prior counsel was ineffective and that he was illegally deported while he had an appeal pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He requests reopening to submit additional evidence regarding his eligibility for relief under section 212(c) of the Act. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the motion.
 
We consider first the jurisdictional issues. According to the respondent’s declaration, he was never notified that the Board had issued its March 26, 1997, decision. He learned of it only after he was taken into DHS custody in September of 2004. The respondent indicated that he filed a petition with the Ninth Circuit, and notified DHS that he had a pending petition. Nevertheless, the respondent indicates that was deported.
 
Section 101(g) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(g), provides that an alien ordered deported or removed who has left the United States is considered to have been deported in pursuance of law. In accordance with this statute, it has long been held that an alien’s departure from the United States pursuant to (or while under) an order of deportation has the effect of executing the order, thereby bringing the deportation proceedings to finality and depriving this Board and the Immigration Judges of jurisdiction to entertain motions with respect to the underlying order. Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864, 864-65 (BIA 1994); Matter of Estrada, 17 I&N Dec. 187, 188 (BIA 1979). This principle is also reflected in the regulations governing the adjudication of motions in immigration court, which provides in relevant part that “¿aº motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of … deportation … proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, has held that the preclusion of reopening for aliens who have departed the United States does not apply with respect to aliens whose departures were unlawful. Weidersperg v. INS, 896 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir. 1990); Mendez v. INS, 563 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1977). The respondent alleges — and the DHS does not challenge — that he was deported while he had an appeal pending before the Ninth Circuit. We agree with the respondent that the pending petition should have stayed his removal and his departure, therefore, was unlawful. Accordingly, we find that the respondent’s motion is not barred by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d).
 
*2 We consider next the timeliness of the respondent’s motion. The respondent filed his motion more than 9 years after we issued our prior decision, far beyond the 90-day time frame for filing motions to reopen set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). He argues that he did not learn of our decision until 2004, when he was taken into DHS custody due to the ineffective actions of his counsel. The Ninth Circuit has found that the filing period for motions to reopen is subject to equitable tolling in cases where the respondent was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).
 
We find, however, that the respondent failed to show the requisite diligence in pursuing this motion. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (recognizing equitable tolling of deadlines on motions to reopen “during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error.”) According to the respondent’s own affidavit, he learned of our decision in September of 2004, but did not file his motion before us until nearly 2 years later, on June 7, 2006. Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent has not diligently pursued his motion before us, and the motion is untimely.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case is presently before us pursuant to the March 31, 2006, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court remanded the case for further consideration of the respondent’s claim that he failed to appear for his scheduled removal hearing due to exceptional circumstances relating to alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent was living in California at the time of his scheduled hearing in Buffalo, New York. His attorney had filed a motion to change venue well in advance of the respondent’s hearing date. In issuing the in absentia order against the respondent, the Immigration Judge did not address the motion to change venue. In its decision in this case, the court cited to its earlier decision in Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 1994). That case involved an alien who moved from Texas to New York, and whose attorney also filed a motion to change venue. That motion was sent 2 days before the scheduled hearing, and was received at a different Immigration Court in Texas.
 
In remanding the case in Romero-Morales v. INS, supra, the court acknowledged that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not excuse an alien’s failure to appear. However, it held that the Immigration Judge is required to consider the record as a whole and to issue a reasoned decision reflecting that the contents of the change of venue motion have been considered. It concluded that, “¿iºf the Immigration Judge and the BIA had considered the bases for that motion as the reasons for the nonappearance, rather than considering only the fact that he had submitted the motion and expected that it would be granted, they might have concluded that Romero’s circumstances were ‘exceptional.”’ The Immigration Judge in the present case, in his March 10, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, did not discuss the contents of the respondent’s change of venue motion.
 
In view of the court’s decision in this case, and the decision in Romero-Morales v. INS, supra, as well as upon further review of the record, we will reopen these proceedings. In reaching this decision, we have also considered that the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved preference visa petition, and it appears that his priority date is now current. Under all these circumstances, reopening is appropriate. Accordingly, the removal proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on June 14, 2005, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s April 14, 2004, decision finding the respondent inadmissible as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).
 
On June 15, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for voluntary departure under section section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s motion because it is untimely filed and the respondent is ineligible for voluntary departure under section 240B(a) if the Act because he is an arriving alien.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied as untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
The respondent argues that the motions deadline should be equitably tolled based on his claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, Ms. Martha E. Garza. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has not published an opinion explicitly adopting the doctrine of equitable tolling in the context of a motion to reopen immigration proceedings. However, even if we assume that such tolling is available to the respondent, he has not established that he is entitled to it based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has failed to prove any prejudice resulting from his former counsel’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
First, the respondent asserts that because Ms. Garza failed to file a timely appeal brief with this Board that he will never know whether he “had a meritorious appeal.” See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exhibit 12 (Respondent’s Affidavit at 3). This Board could have, but did not, summarily dismiss the respondent’s appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) (an appeal may be summarily dismissed where a party indicates on Form EOIR-26 that he will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such a brief or statement, or reasonably explain his failure to do so, within the time set for filing). Instead, we summarily affirmed with decision of the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4). The respondent has failed to show that the filing of an appeal brief would have altered the decision in his case.
 
*2 Second, the respondent asserts that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s failure to inform him of his right to apply for pre-hearing voluntary departure. Arriving aliens, like the respondent, are barred from applying for voluntary departure in lieu of being placed in proceedings or prior to the completion of such proceedings under section 240B(a)(1) of the Act. See section 240B(a)(4) of the Act.
 
Third, the respondent asserts that there could have been a change in the law which might have affected his appeal. The respondent’s assertion is speculative and, in fact, never came to pass. In sum, the respondent has failed to establish how his case was prejudiced as a result of Ms. Garza’s alleged misconduct.
 
Finally, inasmuch as the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion when she failed to grant him another continuance to afford him the opportunity to identify a form of relief for which he was eligible, he has yet to identify a form of relief from removal for which he is eligible. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victor D. Nieblas Pradis, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on April 29, 2003. In that decision, we upheld an Immigration Judge’s March 13, 2002, decision, in which she declined to reconsider her prior decision denying suspension of deportation. We denied a motion to reopen on February 26, 2004, as untimely. We denied another motion to reopen as late, and number-barred, on May 1, 2006. The pending motion was filed late, on May 26, 2006, and is barred by numerical limitations for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
The respondent’s previously filed motions sought to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen. See section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1245; Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). An I-130 immediate relative visa petition was approved on the respondent’s behalf on August 8, 2003.
 
The respondent, in his previous motions to reopen, blamed attorney Timothy McCandless, who has been suspended from practice before the Board, for providing ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent now argues that attorney Walter Burrier, who has also been suspended from practice before the Board, committed ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent argues that Burrier sent a substitute attorney to the immigration court to represent the respondent concerning his suspension claim. The respondent states that, after the Immigration Judge denied his motion to reconsider, and this Board affirmed that denial, Burrier agreed to file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The respondent contends that Burrier then assigned McCandless to file the petition for review, without notifying the respondent, but McCandless failed to file the petition for review. Burrier then filed the first motion to reopen with the Board, which was denied as untimely. The respondent states that Burrier assured him that he would take care of everything. The respondent states that Burrier then prepared the second motion to reopen, which was presented as a pro se motion during the time that Burrier was suspended from practice before the Board. The motion was denied as untimely on May 1, 2006. After the second motion was denied, the respondent consulted current counsel and the pending motion was filed shortly thereafter.
 
*2 The respondent argues that Burrier failed to assist him in timely presenting evidence concerning his application for suspension of deportation, and prepared ineffective motions to reopen (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 15). The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Under the circumstances, we agree that the motions deadline should be excused.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present his application for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge, and to provide further evidence concerning his application for suspension of deportation.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gregory Osakwe, Esquire
*1 On April 28, 1998, this Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen in August 2006, claiming that he was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
The appeal was summarily dismissed because of the failure to file a separate brief or statement. The appeal form itself contained allegations relating to the respondent’s criminal proceedings and failed to raise an appellate issue that we could address. The respondent claims in his motion that his counsel in his criminal proceedings provided ineffective assistance, as did his counsel in his deportation proceedings. Allegedly, the respondent’s former counsel in his deportation proceedings, who reportedly cannot be located, was suspended from practicing law in Connecticut in April 2006, and he filed a complaint against her on August 21, 2006.
 
The nature and quality of the respondent’s representation in his criminal proceedings involves a matter beyond our jurisdiction to address.
 
The respondent does not explain why he waited over 8 years to file a motion to reopen or, for that matter, to file a complaint against his former counsel with her state bar disciplinary board. The failure to file a brief may amount to deprivation of due process. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, we find no basis here for an exception to the time limitations on motions to reopen, in view of the respondent’s failure to exercise due diligence on his own behalf.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph M. Bacho, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony - 101(a)(43)(A)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on March 3, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand these removal proceedings. On June 12, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen.
 
Initially, we observe that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
The respondent argues that the motions deadline should be equitably tolled based on his claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, Mr. Juan Molina. Because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent asserts that but for Mr. Molina’s ineffectiveness his motion to remand would have been granted by the Board. Specifically, he asserts that Mr. Molina did not support the motion with evidence to establish that his criminal conviction was vacated due to a substantive defect. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-3. We agree with the respondent that Mr. Molina’s conduct prejudiced his case. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Because Mr. Molina failed to support the respondent’s motion to remand with a copy of the respondent’s May 12, 2005, motion to vacate, and the May 12, 2005, trial court order, this Board was unable to determine the basis for the trial court’s action. The May 19, 2005, court order, which does not state the court’s reasons for vacating the conviction, was the only document Mr. Molina filed in support of the respondent’s motion to remand.
 
The instant motion to reopen is supported by evidence showing that the respondent’s criminal conviction upon which the removal order is premised has been vacated due to a substantive defect in the criminal proceedings. The respondent proffers a copy of the motion to vacate which he filed with the trial court on April 27, 2005. In his motion, the respondent sought to set aside his June 12 1998, conviction on two grounds: first, because his attorney did not properly investigate the alleged crime; and, second, because he was not informed of the immigration consequences of his criminal conviction. The trial court order dated May 12, 2005, states that “¿Dºefense counsel motioned that this matter to vacate the conviction and guilty plea because defendant states that he was not properly advised regarding the immigration consequences. The People do not oppose the motion.” With that, the court granted the respondent’s motion.1 On May 19, 2005, the court entered an order vacating the respondent’s misdemeanor conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse in violation of section 261.5(c) of the California Penal Code.
 
*2 Reviewing these documents together, it appears that the respondent’s conviction was set aside because the respondent was not advised of the possible consequences of a guilty plea. In applying the definition of conviction at section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, we have found a significant distinction between convictions vacated on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings, as in Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2001), and convictions vacated because of post-conviction events such as rehabilitation or immigration hardships, as in Matter of Roldan, 22 I&N Dec. 512 (BIA 1999). If a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A). If, however, a court vacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings, a respondent may remain “convicted” for immigration purposes. See generally Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). See also Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006).
 
Because the respondent’s conviction is no longer valid for immigration purposes and it was the sole basis for the removal order, we find it appropriate to reopen and terminate these removal proceedings. The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted and removal proceedings are terminated.

It appears that the District Attorney initially opposed the respondent’s motion to vacate arguing that the respondent was, in fact, informed of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. In any event, the motion was ultimately deemed unopposed. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, District Attorney’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities filed March 21, 2005.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa M. Okoh, Esquire
*1 On May 22, 20061, an Immigration Judge issued a removal order against the respondent. The Immigration Judge found the respondent undeserving of a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent has appealed. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the appeal. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
On June 1, 2006, the respondent filed with the immigration court a “Notice of Intent Not to Appeal the Immigration Judge’s Decision”, signed by the respondent’s former counsel. The filing contains a letter which, in no uncertain terms, indicates the respondent’s clear intent not to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision; expeditious removal to Jamaica was requested. At that point, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final; See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39.
 
On August 29, 2006, the respondent’s new counsel submitted a brief, contesting the Immigration Judge’s decision. The brief contains no arguments regarding the withdrawal of the appeal. A later filing with the Board states that previous counsel “fail¿edº to consult with me before filing a waiver of appeal” (Sept. 14, 2006, filing at ¶ 6). This assertion, made by current counsel in a filing to the Board, is not addressed by the respondent in her affidavit. We do not find that the respondent herself adequately alleged that she received ineffective assistance of counsel in withdrawing her appeal. Therefore, based on the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39.
 
We note, however, that the respondent’s brief alleges that she received ineffective assistance of counsel by former counsel concerning the denial of relief under section 212(c) of the Act. We construe these statements to be a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Since we lack jurisdiction to address the respondent’s appeal, we also lack jurisdiction to address a motion to reopen. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); see also Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). The record is therefore returned to the Immigration Court for the Immigration Judge to consider and adjudicate the respondent’s present motion.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on December 22, 2004, at which time we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 29, 2003. The respondent now seeks the reopening of his immigration proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the respondent’s motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), this Board discussed the evidence that must be presented in order for an alien to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel arising in immigration proceedings. See also Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 106 (3d Cir. 2005); Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 131-35 (3d Cir. 2001); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003). See generally Filja v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 241, 256 (3d Cir. 2006); Luntungan v. Att’y Gen. of the United States, 449 F.3d 551 (3d Cir. 2006). In that opinion, we held that not only must an alien satisfy certain procedural requirements, but he must also demonstrate that his attorney’s actions caused him actual prejudice — for instance, the alien must show that but for the errors complained of there was a reasonable probability that he would not have been ordered removed. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377-78 (3d Cir. 2003). In the present matter, the respondent has not complied with all of the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada. See Motion to Reopen, sub-exhs. E-F. Specifically, the respondent has failed to submit an affidavit setting forth in detail his attorney-client agreement. Without evidence of the respondent’s agreement with his former attorney, we cannot conclude that there was ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Furthermore, even were we to assume that his prior counsel had been defective, the instant motion must still be denied because the respondent has not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his attorney’s conduct. For instance, in his motion, the respondent principally argues that his case should be reopened in order to provide him with an opportunity to request the “humanitarian reinstatement” of the visa petition that his mother, who is deceased, previously submitted on his behalf.1 See Exh. 2A at 2 (stating that his mother passed away on May 16, 1995); cf. section 205 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1155; 8 C.F.R. § 1205.1(a)(3)(i)(C) (requiring the revocation of a family-sponsored petition upon the death of the petitioner “unless the Attorney General in his or her discretion determines that for humanitarian reasons revocation would be inappropriate”); see also sections 2(a)(1) and 2(b), Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-150, 116 Stat. 74 (codified as amended at section 213A(f)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(f)(5)). See generally INS Memorandum for Regional Directors - Policy Change - Public Law 107-150, the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002: Use of Substitute Sponsor if Visa Petitioner Has Died (HQADJ 70/21.1.1) (June 15, 2002) (hereinafter “INS Memorandum”), available at http:// www.uscis.gov/graphics/lawsregs/handbook/PL107_150Pub.pdf. However, the reinstatement of the respondent’s visa petition would not by itself provide the respondent with any relief from removal. See section 213A(f)(B) of the Act; see also section 212(a)(4)(C)(ii) of the Act. To the contrary, he would still need to establish his eligibility for either an immigrant visa or section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. See INS Memorandum at 2. For reasons that will be discussed below, we find that the respondent has failed to show that he is prima facie eligible for either form of relief.
 
*2 To establish his eligibility to either adjust his status or obtain an immigrant visa abroad, the respondent must demonstrate that he is admissible to the United States for permanent residence. See, e.g., section 245(a) of the Act. See generally Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98 (3d Cir. 2005). In the present matter, the respondent’s NTA charged him with two grounds of inadmissibility, both of which were sustained by the Immigration Judge.2 See Exh. 1. Although the respondent argues that his prior counsel prejudiced his case by failing to demonstrate that he is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is removable as charged.3 See Interlocutory IJ Dec. (Sept. 15, 2003). See generally Motion to Reopen at 3. The validity of the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as charged is particularly important here because before the respondent could obtain either a new immigrant visa or adjust his status, he must demonstrate his ability to waive any and all applicable grounds of inadmissibility. See generally section 212 of the Act. Unfortunately, the respondent has not submitted any waiver applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (“A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.”); see also Filja v. Gonzales, supra, at 255 (discussing the “three principal grounds” on which the Board may deny a motion to reopen immigration proceedings). Moreover, he has failed to make out a prima facie case for any such applications, all of which are discretionary.4 Accordingly, we find that the respondent has not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s conduct.
 
In view of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is denied.

1

With regard to the sufficiency of the respondent’s Notice to Appear (“NTA”), we note that the Act and the regulations do not require that an immigration official’s signature or title be included on a Notice to Appear. See section 239(a)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(c). See generally 8 C.F.R. §§ 239(a), 1239.1(a). Furthermore, the regulations state that the omission of any of the enumerated items “shall not provide the alien with any substantive or procedural rights.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(c). Therefore, we do not find that the respondent’s Notice to Appear (NTA) is defective for failing to comply with section 239 of the Act or the regulations.

2

The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that he is inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act.

3

During the earlier proceedings, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act as a result of his willful misrepresentation of the fact that his mother had passed away before the issuance of his immigrant visa. See Interlocutory IJ Dec. (Sept. 15, 2003). See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1205.1(a)(3)(i)(C). The respondent has never testified or submitted any evidence indicating that he did not know that his immigrant visa application at least insinuated that his mother was still alive at the time he obtained his visa. See Exh. 2E (indicating, in 1998, that the respondent’s father was deceased; but providing a current United States address for his mother); cf. Exh. 2A at 2. See generally Exhs. 2B, 2F and 2G. Inasmuch as his failure to provide this information cut off a line of inquiry on an issue that was material to his ability to procure an immigrant visa, we agree that he has failed to demonstrate that he is not removable under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act.

4

The respondent has failed to even establish that he is prima facie eligible for the humanitarian reinstatement of the visa petition that his mother filed on his behalf. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see also Filja v. Gonzales, supra, at 255. While the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002 would provide him with a practical means of seeking reinstatement, to do so he would still need to submit an affidavit of support (Form I-864) from a “substitute” sponsor. Insofar as the statute permits only certain family members to qualify as such and the respondent has not shown that he has a relative who is both willing to act as his substitute sponsor and could qualify as one, he has not submitted sufficient evidence from which we could infer that he has even a plausible claim for relief. Moreover, in light of the manner in which the respondent previously obtained an immigrant visa, we likewise conclude that he has not shown that he would merit this, or any, discretionary grant form of relief.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark R. Whitworth,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 05, 2006. The respondent’s attorney appeared at the respondent’s hearing on October 27, 1986, but the respondent failed to appear. The respondent was ordered to be deported in proceedings conducted in absentia. More than 17 years later, the respondent filed two motions to reopen, claiming that she had no notice of the hearing and that she is eligible for relief from deportation. The Immigration Judge found that the notice was properly served on the respondent’s counsel who had appeared at the hearing, and who attested that he sent notice to the respondent but she did not maintain contact with him. He denied both motions. On October 20, 2005, the respondent filed a third motion to reopen. She claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge found that he could not determine what agreement the respondent had with her former counsel, and that there was no evidence that she had informed him of her averments: He concluded that she had not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), affd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and that her motion was untimely. On appeal, the respondent correctly points out that her motion included her statement of the agreement she had with her former counsel, notice to him of her allegations, and his response. See Motion to Reopen dated October 14, 2005, Exhibits G and H-1. We agree that she has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. However, the evidence indicates that the respondent’s former counsel sent the hearing notice to the respondent at the address she provided, and filed the change of venue motion that she requested. See Exhibit H-1, supra. He appeared at the hearing and explained that the respondent failed to maintain contact with him. In fact, the respondent failed to contact her former counsel or inquire into the status of her deportation proceedings for more than 17 years. The evidence does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s lack of diligence indicates that favorable discretion is not warranted. The motion was appropriately denied. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Sharma-Crawford, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karl V. Cozad
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s June 21, 2005, decision denying his motion to terminate removal proceedings and finding him removable as charged. The appeal will be sustained, and the proceedings will be terminated.
 
At his hearing, the respondent filed a motion to terminate proceedings, and submitted evidence that the Circuit Court of Pemiscot County, Missouri, had vacated the conviction upon which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had based the respondent’s removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Exh. 14). Consequently, the respondent argued that, consistent with the Board’s decision in Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006), the Immigration Court should no longer consider his conviction valid for immigration purposes because his guilty plea was vacated pursuant to Rule 29.07(d) of the Missouri Rules of Criminal Procedure due to a “misunderstanding of the nature of the charge” and or plea that was involuntarily compelled “as a result of a promise or mistaken belief, which resulted in “manifest injustice”. In response to his motion before the Immigration Court, the DHS argued that the Missouri Circuit Court order vacated the respondent’s plea without explanation, and that the Immigration Judge should, therefore, infer that the order was issued to avoid immigration penalties. The Immigration Judge agreed with the DHS’ argument, and found the respondent removable as charged.
 
We disagree for two reasons. Initially, we note that, in his motion before the Missouri Circuit Court, the respondent specifically argued that he had misunderstood the nature of the charge to which he pled, and we find it inappropriate to conclude that the Court vacated the respondent’s plea for an unarticulated reason unrelated to his stated argument. Moreover, as the respondent argues on appeal, Rule 29.07(d) indicates that a motion to withdraw a plea is generally filed before sentence is imposed or when imposition of sentence is suspended, but the Rule also states that “to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.” As such, this language indicates that the intent of Rule 29.07 is remedial in nature; in other words, Rule 29.07(d) is intended to “correct”, rather than prevent, manifest injustice.1 See generally Brown v. State, 66 S.W.3d 721 (2002); see also State v. Sexton, 75 S.W.3d 304 (Mo.App.S.D. 2002); Logan v. State, 22 S.W.3d 783 (Mo.App.W.D. 2000). We therefore also decline to presume, without further evidence, that the Missouri Circuit Court granted the respondent’s motion prospectively to prevent the respondent’s removal. Neither the pleadings filed by the respondent, nor the intent of Rule 29.07, leads us to reach this conclusion. As such, we do not find clear and convincing evidence that the respondent’s conviction remains valid for immigration purposes. As such, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s immigration proceedings are terminated.

On appeal, the DHS appears to argue that its conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Rule 29.07 can only be utilized prior to referral to the Department of Corrections. Since the respondent has already served his sentence, we presume that the DHS is arguing that the Missouri court has utilized Rule 29.07 ultra vires in order to circumvent the respondent’s removal in immigration proceedings. We do not draw this conclusion. Moreover, we note that Missouri case law indicates that Rule 29.07 can also be invoked, whether or not such referral has taken place “on grounds other than those enumerated in Rule 24.035”. See Brown v. State, supra. Rule 24.035, in turn, addresses specific claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel and jurisdictional issues, which are unrelated to the respondent’s Rule 29.07 motion.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on March 29, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s applications for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. On June 29, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen in which he claims that he received ineffective assistance from his former criminal attorney, Karen Stevens, and the appellate attorney in his criminal case, Daniel Koryn, as well as from his former immigration attorney, Steve Hershberger, whom he claims did not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the two criminal/appellate attorneys and who did not raise sufficiently aggressive arguments regarding the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of a section 212(h) waiver. Through his motion, the respondent seeks to again apply for a section 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility and adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the motion. The respondent’s motion for a stay of removal was denied on July 20, 2006. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In addition, the respondent’s motion does not comply with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Statements of counsel regarding whether bar complaints were filed or former counsels notified of the allegations are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). As the respondent has not complied with the Lozada requirements, his motion to reopen is denied. See Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that the general application of the Lozada requirements does not constitute an abuse of discretion by the Board). See also Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, ___ F.3d ___, 2006 WL 2390283 at 1, n. 4 (5th Cir. Aug. 21, 2006) (stating that alien had failed to comply with Lozada requirements and the application of those requirements was not an abuse of discretion).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Camarena, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated May 8, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that notice to the respondent’s counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See Section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255. The record reflects that the Notice of Hearing was sent to the respondent’s counsel by regular mail (Exh. 3) and included the date and time of his hearing in October 2005. The respondent did not appear, at the hearing and the Immigration Judge correctly ordered him removed in absentia.
 
Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F)of the Act. Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, the record reflects that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel at his correct address, as reflected in the Form EOIR-28. There is no indication that the hearing notice was returned to the Immigration Court.
 
Furthermore, this case is distinguishable from Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002), wherein the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that, under the circumstances, a sworn affidavit from the alien that neither she nor a responsible party residing at her address received the notice was sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery and entitle an alien to an evidentiary hearing to consider the veracity of her allegations. In that case, the alien had actually initiated a proceeding to obtain a benefit and an affidavit was submitted with the motion, Id. at 1079.
 
In the instant matter, there is no indication that the respondent initiated removal proceedings. Moreover, the respondent did not submit an affidavit to overcome the presumption of proper delivery.
 
Lastly, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails because the respondent has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aft’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeff Lindblad
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N ACt ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 24, 2006, decision denying him a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996).1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The issues on appeal include whether a fair hearing was conducted before the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver. The respondent contends on appeal that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion and violated the respondent’s due process, both by admitting into evidence proffered by the respondent’s spouse without requiring her to testify, and by going outside the record of conviction in denying his application. He also argues that, as the counsel who represented him both before the Immigration Judge, failed to have the Immigration Judge suppress the evidence of the restraining order, he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent argues that, by going outside the record of conviction in denying his waiver application, there was a denial of due process. However, the Immigration Judge, upon review of the record as a whole, balances the adverse factors evidencing an alien’s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of section 212(c) relief appears in the best interests of this country. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581, 585 (BIA 1978). The respondent has questioned the admissibility of a restraining order, arguing that the order was entered in absentia, as well as the admissibility of a letter from his spouse (Gp. Exh. 9). While the respondent challenges the validity of the order, he has conceded that he was aware of the court date, but failed to appear (Tr. at 114). An Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the case made by the alien or any other person during any investigation or examination. Such evidence may be admitted as long as it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair so as not to violate due process standards. Matter of Escobar, 18 I&N Dec. 412 (BIA 1983); Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276 (BIA 1982). As for the statement from his spouse, his counsel objected to its use as there was no opportunity to cross-examine her (Tr. at 102-3). The Immigration Judge acknowledged that problem (Tr. at 104), and we note that the Immigration Judge considered the restraining order but gave no weight to his spouse’s statement, making no reference to the contents of the letter in his decision. To the extent that the respondent argues that prior counsel’s representation was ineffective, he has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and has not provided persuasive evidence of prejudice arising from counsel’s allegedly deficient performance, i.e, evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different had counsel objected to clearly admissible evidence, the restraining order. See Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome). Accordingly, there has been no showing that the respondent’s hearing was not fairly conducted.
 
*2 As for the adequacy of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent argues that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) failed to prove that he is undeserving of a waiver. However, regulations provide that the respondent, not the DHS, shall have the burden of establishing that he is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The Immigration Judge properly weighed all of the adverse and favorable factors in denying the respondent a section 212(c) waiver. Matter of Marin, supra. The Immigration Judge considered all of those favorable factors, individually and cumulatively, but nonetheless concluded, based upon the adverse factors of record, including the crimes the respondent had committed, that this outweighed the favorable factors. No arguments have been presented on appeal by the respondent which persuade us that the Immigration Judge’s decision should be disturbed. In sum, we find that the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver was properly denied by the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent finally argues in his appeal that the proceedings were an unconstitutional violation of equal protection and due process. It is well-settled that this Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate facial constitutional challenges to the Act or its implementing regulations. Matter of C-20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ruchi Thaker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before the Board on March 24, 2006, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2004, order finding the respondent removable as charged and denying his applications for relief from removal, in particular his application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, (the “Act”) 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On June 22, 2006, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the proceedings, asserting that his former counsel provided him ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to call attention to the case Restrepo v. McElroy, 369 F.3d 627 (2d Cir. 2004). The motion will be denied.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counser’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The respondent’s motion satisfies each of these elements.
 
However, Lozada, also requires the claimant to establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-562 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998). For the reasons stated below, we find that the representation was not negligent and the respondent has not shown prejudice in this case.
 
The sole basis for the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that former counsel, the Immigration Judge, and this Board failed to consider Restrepo. According to the respondent, Restrepo stands for the proposition that an alien who relied on the availability of § 212(c) relief in going to trial, rather than pleading guilty, remains eligible for a § 212(c) waiver after the repeal of the statute. We disagree. Under governing Second Circuit precedent, the repeal of § 212(c) is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to aliens like the respondent who were convicted of a criminal charge at trial before the elimination of § 212(c), because they “cannot show that they altered their conduct in reliance on the availability of such relief.” Rankine v. Reno, 319 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis added); cf. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 326 (holding that “§ 212(c) relief remains available for aliens … whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for § 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect”). In Thorn v. Ashcroft, 369 F.3d 158, 161-63 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit reaffirmed Rankine, and distinguished Restrepo, as a case in which the alien claimed an alternative basis for relying on the availability of § 212(c). Specifically, the petitioner in Restrepo claimed that he decided to forgo the opportunity to apply for § 212(c) relief “affirmatively” under 8 C.F.R. § 212.3 (b), before being placed in deportation proceedings. Restrepo, at 622, 636.
 
*2 Unlike the petitioner in Restrepo, the respondent has not raised an alternative basis for relying on the availability of § 212(c) relief. In particular, he has made no assertion that he delayed filing an affirmative application for § 212(c) relief in reliance upon the continued existence of § 212(c).1 Therefore, we find that the respondent’s case falls squarely within the holding of Rankine, as an alien convicted of a criminal charge at trial and that he suffered no prejudice through his former counsel’s failure to cite Restrepo.2 In light of our finding that Restrepo is not controlling, we need not address the respondent’s remaining arguments, each of which stem from that case. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.

We further note that a petitioner claiming reliance based on the Restrepo set of circumstances—where an alien claims detrimental reliance on the continued existence § 212(c) in delaying the filing of an affirmative application for § 212(c) relief—must make an individualized showing of reliance on the continued existence of § 212(c) relief. Thompson v. Ridge, 2005 WL 433277 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting that the Second Circuit in Restrepo left open the question of whether individual reliance must be shown or a “categorical” approach should be applied to all such aliens). The respondent has made no such showing in this case.

2

Additionally, we note that former counsel argued on appeal that the respondent was eligible for § 212(c) relief under Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 480 (3d Cir. 2004), a case in which the petitioner was permitted to file a § 212(c) application even though he did not accept a plea agreement and was convicted after trial. Although a Third Circuit decision is not binding in this case, we find that the citation of Ponnapula was sufficient to call attention to the respondent’s potential eligibility for § 212(c) relief under the St. Cyr, supra, line of cases.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Matthew Hall,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 07, 2006. The record reflects that the respondent appeared before an Immigration Judge on November 8, 2005, and was allowed the opportunity to depart the United States voluntarily by March 8, 2006. On February 24, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. Therein, the respondent indicates that his mother filed a visa petition on his behalf, and he is prima facie eligible to adjust his status to a lawful permanent resident of the United States. He further indicates in his affidavit that his former counsel may not have notified the Immigration Judge at the hearing of the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal. He requested a new hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on March 7, 2006, and this appeal followed.
 
The respondent argues in his Notice of Appeal that his former counsel was negligent in these proceedings because counsel failed to advise the Immigration Judge at the hearing that he was eligible for adjustment of status. However, the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely filed because it was submitted more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s November 8, 2005, order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). The respondent has also failed to indicate when he learned of his counsel’s alleged negligence. We therefore cannot find based on the evidence submitted that equitable tolling of the period for seeking reopening is appropriate.
 
In addition, the respondent fails to meet the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 127 F.3d 833, 838-39 (10th Cir. 2005) (recognizing the requirements for filing ineffective assistance of counsel claims). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for proving that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings to allow the respondent a new hearing. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vargas, Patricia, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 11, 2006. The respondent’s case was last before us on January 4, 2002, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with an opportunity to seek a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. 2271 (2001). The record reflects that the respondent was present with counsel on October 13, 2005, when the Immigration Judge provided notice concerning the next hearing to be held on January 19, 2006. On January 19, 2006, the respondent failed to appear. On March 28, 2006, he submitted a motion to reopen, and claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. He stated that he failed to appear due to the specific instruction from his counsel that he did not need to appear for that hearing because it would be continued. The respondent has explained his decision not to file a bar complaint. The issue on appeal is whether the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s counsel had appeared at the hearing and verified that the respondent had notice of the hearing. She concluded that the respondent had not demonstrated substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
According to the respondent’s affidavit, two different individuals from the law firm that continues to represent him told him he did not need to appear for the hearing on January 19, 2006. Both individuals named by the respondent, Mr. Duran and Mr. Ramos, have submitted entry of appearance forms indicating they were admitted to the bar in the state of California. Under these circumstances, and considering that Ms. Vargas confirmed on the day of the last hearing that the respondent had proper notice, we do not find this to be a situation where full compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is unnecessary. It is not clear from the record who is to blame for the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing for which he admittedly received proper notice from the Immigration Judge. If a properly licensed attorney told the respondent he need not appear under these circumstances, then compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is necessary to assign responsibility for this ineffective assistance. The respondent’s suggestion that he received “erroneous instructions” which “do not merit a complaint to the State Bar” is unpersuasive because it is not merely the respondent’s prerogative as to whether or not to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. Given the different attorneys who were apparently involved in the respondent’s representation, this is simply not a case where “the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The Immigration Judge appropriately denied reopening. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy W. Apostol, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stephen M. Ruhle
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated April 26, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the order of deportation that had been entered on May 14, 1984, in deportation proceedings which had been conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b), due to the respondent’s failure to appear. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he had no knowledge that he had ever been placed under deportation proceedings. Moreover, he disclaims any knowledge of the attorney who represented him in those proceedings, and in any event, maintains that he did not receive notice of the deportation hearing scheduled for May 14, 1984, and that said attorney failed to notify him of that hearing and his actions constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, and establish reasonable cause for his failure to appear.
 
The respondent’s allegations are belied by the record. At the outset, we consider the respondent received personal service of the Order to Show Cause (form I-221S) on June 10, 1983, while he was detained at the El Paso Processing Center. The respondent’s fingerprint and signature were placed on the Order to Show Cause at the time it was served (Exh. 1). Furthermore, the record indicates the respondent retained the attorney Paul Douglass to represent him as evidenced by the Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney (Form G-28) filed on the respondent’s behalf and dated June 14, 1983 (Exh. 2). The respondent’s counsel, Paul Douglass, then filed a motion for bond redetermination dated June 14, 1983 (Exh. 3), and the respondent’s bond was reduced to $500 after a bond hearing held on June 14, 1983 (Exh. 4). On June 15, 1983, the respondent posted bond and was released from custody, and the respondent’s counsel, Paul Douglass, was the obligor for this bond (Exh. 5). Upon his release from custody, the respondent was served with a notice that his hearing had been rescheduled to an undetermined future date (Exh. 6). On June 30, 1983, the Immigration Court sent notice of the respondent’s rescheduled hearing for May 14, 1984, to his attorney Paul Douglass, by certified mail, return receipt requested (Exh. 7). This notice was accepted and signed for by the office of his attorney Paul Douglass on July 1, 1983 (Exh. 8). The record reflects the respondent failed to appear for the rescheduled hearing. See I.J. Dec. at 2. Since the respondent failed to appear for the hearing on May 14, 1984, he was ordered deported in absentia to Mexico (Exh. 9).
 
*2 We find that the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the Immigration Court provided proper notice of the hearing to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Moreover, we find no support for the respondent’s contention that his attorney of record failed to inform him that he had a scheduled hearing which resulted in the order of deportation being entered in his absence.
 
We have held that to satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support his claim by a detailed affidavit, inform his previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the prongs described in Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, we find that the respondent has not satisfied a Lozada showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997) (burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Consequently, we find that the respondent received proper notice of his hearing and that he has not provided any reasonable cause of his failure to appear. See Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987). The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has made a motion to the Board to change the respondent’s alien registration number in the Executive Office for Immigration Review’s records from A20 687 951 to A79 041 781. This order so recognizes the request and hereby effects the changes needed in the instant record of proceedings and the Executive Office for Immigration Review databases. Both parties shall likewise modify their records accordingly and will ensure that the new alien registration number is used in any future correspondence involving this respondent.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan R. Diamante, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
This matter was last before the Board on May 11, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen filed December 14, 2005, as being time and numbers barred and finding that equitable tolling of the requirements otherwise governing reopening requests was not warranted in this case.1 On June 9, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider our May 11, 2006, decision. The motion is denied.
 
Pursuant to the federal regulations, a motion to reconsider should specify the claimed errors of fact or law in the Board’s prior order and should be supported by pertinent authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991), aff’d, 979 F.2d 212 (11th Cir. 1992) (table case). The respondent asserts that in denying his motion to reopen, the Board did not take into consideration the full breadth of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim as it relates to the conduct of Ms. Laura Friend, or his claims that he was prejudiced thereby in various ways. See Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider (“Motion to Reconsider”).
 
More particularly, the respondent explains that his ineffective assistance claim is based on factors in addition to the bad advice Ms. Friend gave that resulted in his being placed in removal proceedings at time when he was ineligible for relief. For example, he points out that Ms. Friend misrepresented to him that she was a licensed attorney. However, in our decision we expressly noted his claim that Ms. Friend, a non-attorney, held herself out to be an attorney. See Board order (“Order”), May 11, 2006, p. 1. The respondent also contends that Ms. Friend submitted a Form G-28 in Immigration Court claiming to be licensed to practice in Wisconsin. However, this form was not filed in Immigration Court in the respondent’s case, and it is the respondent’s case that is the only one before us now for consideration. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen as amended, p. 55. In any event, we reiterate that in our prior order we explicitly noted the respondent’s claim that Ms. Friend held herself out to be an attorney. See Order, p. 1.
 
The respondent also contends that Ms. Friend provided ineffective assistance to him by continually advising him that his case was being effectively handled, and by her illegal practice of law as evidenced by her “having attorneys submit an appeal with the Board and a motion to reopen on ¿the respondent’sº behalf both of which were filed untimely, under her supervision.” See Motion to Reconsider, p. 8. However, contrary to the respondent’s assertion, his appeal was timely filed. It is true that his subsequent motion was untimely filed and was denied on this basis, but aside from this consideration that motion was not grantable because a prima facie showing of eligibility for section 245(i) adjustment of status had not been made, inasmuch as the underlying labor certification had not been approved and the employment-based visa petition based on an approved labor certification had not been filed, much less approved.
 
*2 Regarding his claim of the “ill-handling” of his labor certification petition, our prior order did not explicitly discuss this specific contention. However, we did address his assertion that Ms. Friend was to blame for his inability to affirmatively apply for adjustment of status. See Order, p. 2. His eligibility for such relief, of course, rested on actions taken with respect to the underlying labor certification and employment-based visa petition.
 
The respondent also asserts that we did not consider his claim that the delay in the approval of the pertinent labor certification was the direct result of Ms. Friend’s ineffective assistance and incompetence. See Motion to Reconsider, p. 9. Even assuming that this claim was not fully addressed in our May 11, 2006, decision, the claim itself is speculative in nature. The record reflects that the labor certification application in question was prepared and filed soon after the respondent met with Ms. Friend. See attachments to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, filed November 16, 1999 (“Motion to Reopen”). It was assigned a priority date of March 31, 1997, and although it took a lengthy period of time for it to be reviewed and approved, it has not been established by the respondent’s motion to reopen or his amended motion to reopen that this delay was attributable directly or primarily to actions or inactions on the part of Ms. Friend, or that Ms. Friend’s handling of the labor certification application (which was ultimately approved) or the strategic decisions made regarding this aspect of his case amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.2 Although he asserts, through counsel, that the labor certification process “could” have been completed faster, there was not an adequate showing that this would have been the case, particularly given the many issues and steps involved in securing government approval of a labor certification application and/or a corresponding employment-based visa petition. See Motion to Reopen, pp. 1-2.
 
The respondent contends that “his labor certification could have been completed faster, since by placing him and his wife in removal proceedings Ms. Friend caused jurisdiction to vest in the immigration court and the immigration service no longer had jurisdiction to approve his adjustment of status application. This in of itself delayed the processing of ¿the respondent’sº labor certification petition from being approved until June 17, 2002, and this delayed processing was clearly not a natural processing delay.” See Motion to Reconsider, p. 10. The record does not support this assertion. To the contrary, the record reflects that despite the facts that the respondent was placed in removal proceedings, ordered removed by an Immigration Judge on May 1, 1998, and his appeal of that order was dismissed by this Board on June 18, 1999, the processing of the labor certification continued, the labor certification was ultimately approved, the corresponding employment-based visa petition was filed on March 21, 2001, and that it was approved on June 17, 2002. See Amended Motion to Reopen, Tabs D and E, pp. 12, 13. It is has not been established that his proceedings in Immigration Court adversely affected the independent processing of the labor certification or the related visa petition. He became eligible for adjustment of status only after these actions occurred and years after his removal proceedings were completed. See Order, p. 2. Indeed, his adjustment application was not filed with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service until June 28, 2002. See Amended Motion to Reopen, Tab D. Thus, the jurisdictional argument advanced by the respondent is unavailing.
 
*3 In his motion to reconsider, the respondent also asserts that the holding in Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004), which we relied on in our prior decision, is inapplicable here. See Motion to Reconsider, pp. 11-12. We disagree and stand by our prior decision in this regard.
 
With respect to the respondent’s contention that he was denied a full and fair hearing due to Ms. Friend’s ineffective assistance, this contention also is without merit. See Motion to Reconsider, pp. 15-16, 20. Ms. Friend did not represent the respondent in Immigration Court, attorney Linda Howard did, and there has been no showing that her legal representation of him in those proceedings was incompetent or would support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against her (Tr. at 1-10). Indeed, the respondent has elected not to proceed on such a claim and has not filed a bar complaint against attorney Howard. See Motion to Reconsider, pp. 6, 21-22. Although he now contends that he was denied the opportunity to have counsel of his choice represent him in his proceedings before the Immigration Judge, it was the respondent himself who confirmed to the Immigration Judge in two separate hearings that Ms. Howard was his attorney. See Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider, p. 20; Tr. at 1 (January 27, 1998, hearing); Tr. at 5 (May 1, 1998, hearing).3 He registered no objection to Ms. Howard representing him.
 
With respect to his claim that the motion filed by attorney Robert F. Jacobs wasted his “one opportunity to reopen his case and have his adjustment of status through his labor certification case adjudicated,” we are not persuaded. See Motion to Reconsider, p. 21. The motion filed by attorney Jacobs was in fact premised on a claim of eligibility for adjustment of status based on the labor certification that was pending and given that visas were then available in the relevant preference category. However, as discussed above, although that motion was denied as being untimely filed, it could not have been granted because his prima facie eligibility for section 245(i) adjustment of status was not demonstrated. Moreover, his argument is conjectural that “but for” Ms. Friend’s handling of the labor certification/employment-based visa petition these applications would have been approved prior to the filing of his first motion or at some point prior thereto. In any event, the respondent has elected not to pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Jacobs. See Motion to Reconsider, p. 6, 22.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

On June 18, 1999, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s May 1, 1998, decision denying his request for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act for lack of a showing of the requisite period of continuous physical presence in this country, and granting him the privilege of voluntary departure upon the posting of a $500.00 bond. On November 16, 1999, he filed a motion requesting reopening so that he could be considered for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act given that there was a pending labor certification in his behalf and a skilled worker visa was currently available. The Board denied the motion on January 10, 2001, as being untimely filed. On December 14, 2005, almost 4 years after his first motion was denied, the respondent, through newly-retained counsel, filed a second motion (which was later supplemented by an amended motion to reopen), claiming ineffective assistance of counsel by his former representative. We denied this motion on May 11, 2006, and it is this decision that the respondent is asking us to reconsider.

We observe that the respondent has appended to his motion to reconsider certain exhibits relating to the processing of the labor certification. See Motion to Reconsider, Exhs. D-G. However, this material was not previously submitted, and the very specific arguments now being advanced based on this material were not set forth in the respondent’s motion to reopen or amended motion to reopen. Inasmuch as a motion to reconsider looks to whether a mistake of law or fact was made in the prior decision based on the record in existence at the time of the decision, this new material will not be considered in the adjudication of the request for reconsideration now before us. Ibid., pp. 8, 17-19.

Although the date of this hearing is identified at the bottom of page 5 of the transcript as being January 27, 1998, this is a transcription error and should read May 1, 1998.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew Guadagno, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º-Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves to reopen our decision dated April 19, 2002, dismissing his appeal. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of prior counsel by Ren Rong Pan, Esquire, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal before the Board. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision. The motion would have been due on July 18, 2002. While motions to reopen premised on ineffective assistance may be subject to an equitable toll, the respondent has not established that he exercised the due diligence required for such tolling. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 128 (2d Cir.2000)). The court stated in Cekic, “Tolling is available if the alien can demonstrate that (1) his counsel’s conduct violated ¿hisº constitutional right to due process, and (2) the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period ¿heº seeks to toll.” Id. To make this showing, an alien must demonstrate that he pursued his case “¿fºrom the point at which the ineffective assistance of counsel should have been, or was in fact, discovered.” See id. at 171 (citing Iavorski, 232 F.3d at 135). It is the respondent’s burden to establish that the 90-day deadline should be equitably tolled, but his motion is lacking in detail, and he has thus failed to establish due diligence. See Cekic at 170 noting that “no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.” It appears, moreover, that the respondent should have discovered the alleged ineffective assistance of prior counsel at least by 2003, since the Board had affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision and dismissed the appeal in 2002. The respondent did not file the instant motion until June 27, 2006, years after his direct appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision had been dismissed, and years after he had retained Mr. Pan. In the affidavit the respondent admits he was dissatisfied with prior counsel’s representation when his appeal was dismissed by the Board, but he took no prompt action. The respondent cannot be considered to have diligently pursued his case during the period he now seeks to toll. See also Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517-18 (2d Cir.2006) (concluding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that alien had not exercised reasonable diligence). Accordingly, the respondent does not qualify for equitable tolling.

APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on May 31, 2005, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge in order to obtain a complete transcript and record of proceedings. The Immigration Judge indicates that, upon review of the tapes and transcript, the record is in fact complete. Thus, we will now consider the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s February 2, 2004, decision and order, finding the respondent to be removable as charged and finding that all applications for relief were waived for failure to timely submit any applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The respondent requests a remand for further proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The respondent, in his Notice of Appeal, indicates that the Immigration Judge’s decision constituted an abuse of discretion and that it was contrary to law. However, these averments were never supported or explained. Rather, in his appeal brief, the respondent simply submitted a request to remand the record for further proceedings, indicating that the respondent was eligible for 212(c) relief and indicating that the respondent was still trying to prove that his father was a United States citizen. As the respondent has not given any reasons supporting his allegations of error and abuse of discretion1, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that there is any reversible error in the instant case.
 
Concerning 212(c), the respondent has not given any explanation why he failed to ever submit an application for 212(c) relief. At the August 1, 2001, status conference, the respondent’s counsel was given 9 months to prepare and submit a form I-191 (a 212(c) application). See August 1, 2001, transcript, at p.4. The respondent’s counsel was told three times that he must submit the 212(c) application by May 1, 2002. Id., at p.4-6. However, no such application was ever submitted, nor was there any request for an extension to file such application. See February 2, 2004, transcript, at p. 15. Hence, the Immigration Judge properly indicated that such application was deemed waived. Id., at p. 16; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (an Immigration Judge has the authority to set a time limit for the filing of applications for relief, and any applications not filed within that time limit shall be deemed waived).
 
*2 The respondent has requested a remand, in order to have the opportunity to file a 212(c) application. However, no explanation has ever been given for failing to meet the previous filing deadline; thus, we have found that such application was properly deemed waived. Furthermore, even if such application was not waived, such application was required to be submitted for consideration of a remand for the purpose of pursuing such application. A motion to remand is subject to the same requirements as a motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1), (c)(4); see also Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999) (indicating that a motion to reopen filed during the pendency of an appeal may be styled as a motion to remand; however, in substance it remains a motion to reopen); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992). In order to obtain a remand of the record, for the purpose of submitting an application for relief, such motion must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation. Id. Here, the respondent failed to attach an application for 212(c) relief, in addition to supporting documentation, to his appeal or motion. Thus, even if the 212(c) application had not previously been waived, the respondent’s motion to remand would be denied for failure to submit the application with his motion.
 
The respondent also claims that he is still attempting to prove that his father was a United States citizen. We note that the respondent indicated that there were documents that were damaged or destroyed and he was pursuing other means of documenting his father’s United States citizen status, as of the August 1, 2001, status conference. See August 1, 2001, transcript, at p.2; see also February 2, 2004, transcript, at p. 16. It has now been more than 5 years since the respondent indicated that there were damaged military documents and that he was continuing to pursue other sources of documentation. There is no evidence that any other documentation has ever been discovered or presented. Neither the respondent, nor the respondent’s counsel, have given any indication concerning what steps have been taken to further pursue any documentation. We can not indefinitely postpone a hearing while the respondent continues to search for documentation. The respondent’s counsel, at the August 1, 2001, status conference, was told to pursue this documentation and to file a form N-600. See August 1, 2001, transcript, at p.2. There is no indication that this has been diligently pursued or that such form has ever been filed. We can not find that the respondent has established that there is sufficient evidence that he is a United States citizen or that he has derived such status. Thus, we can not find any error in this regard. We note that there is no indication that a form N-600 was ever filed and such form was not presented with the motion to remand. We do not find that there has been sufficient reason given to remand the record, concerning the respondent’s claim to United States citizenship, in the instant case.
 
*3 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion to remand is denied.

Although the respondent never specifically mentions his prior oral motion for a continuance, made at his February 2, 2004, hearing, we will address such motion in dicta in this footnote. We note that an oral motion for a continuance was made at the February 2, 2004, hearing by the respondent, in the absence of his counsel. The respondent stated that his counsel was ill, and that the counsel was trying to vacate one of his criminal convictions. The Immigration Judge noted that such counsel never submitted anything in writing requesting a continuance. We note that there is no affidavit from the respondent’s counsel, regarding the alleged illness. A motion to reopen was not filed. There is no doctor’s note or other evidence in the record supporting the respondent’s averments concerning his counsel’s health. The Immigration Judge indicated that the respondent had received a total of seven continuances during proceedings, four of which occurred after the venue of the proceedings was changed. Thus, although this is dicta, we note that the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying the respondent’s oral motion for a continuance at the February 2, 2004, hearing. We further note that the respondent has not alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, there is no reversible error established and no adequate reason to remand the record.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on June 2, 2005, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s May 7, 2004, decision finding the respondent removable as charged, statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, and denying his application for voluntary departure. The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, on August 22, 2006, filed a motion to reopen. He acknowledges that the motion was not filed in a timely fashion but urges that the proceedings should be reopened by reason of his submission of evidence showing prima facie eligibility for relief as well as evidence which is material. He also requests reopening by reason of ineffective assistance of counsel, both during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge, and on appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date that decision was rendered, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the instant case, the Board issued a decision on June 2, 2005. A motion to reopen would therefore have been due on or before Thursday, September 1, 2005. As the respondent acknowledges, the motion was untimely where it was filed on August 22, 2006, approximately 12 months after it was due. The respondent claims that the filing deadline should be ignored as he is eligible for relief and has submitted material evidence. However, those are the requirements which must be satisfied for the Board to grant a timely filed motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
In our precedent decision in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we emphasized the importance of the time limits on motions to reopen, noting the need to discourage dilatory motions and Congress’ mandate that we do so. We further recognized our limited discretionary power to reopen, as well as the need to exercise such power only in exceptional situations. Id., see also Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). The burden is on the respondent to demonstrate that an exceptional situation exists. The respondent in this case has failed to meet that burden. The respondent identifies June 2, 2005, the date of the Board decision, as the last date of his claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. In that decision, we found that he had failed to meet the procedural requirements as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and that he had failed to show prejudice. In his motion he fails to address why his untimely motion to reopen should be considered, given that nothing in his motion presents a circumstance which precluded him from timely filing his motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed out of time, and we find that exercising our discretion to reopen this matter is not in order.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent intended his “Motion to Reopen and Reconsider” to be considered a motion to reconsider, we point out that it is untimely. A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The Board’s decision in this case was entered on June 2, 2005. Thus, a motion to reconsider would have been due on or before July 5, 2005. Accordingly, to the extent that we consider the respondent’s motion as a motion to reconsider, it must be considered to have been filed out of time.
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maribel Herrera, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sylke Merchan,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on November 28, 2001. On March 21, 2006, she filed a motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge requesting an opportunity to be considered for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on April 13, 2006, and this appeal followed.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status is untimely because it was filed more than 90 days after the order of removal was entered by the Immigration Judge. Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). On appeal, the respondent argues that an “exceptional circumstance” caused her to miss her hearing before the Immigration Judge. According to the respondent, her prior legal representatives were negligent, and these proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel. This issue was not raised before the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent’s claim for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was submitted more than 180 days after the removal order was entered, and is therefore untimely. We further find it inappropriate to equitably toll the statute of limitations for seeking reopening. See Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488 (7th Cir. 2005)(considering deadline for filing motion to reopen in the context of an in absentia hearing). The “test” for equitable tolling, as stated by the court in Pervaiz, supra, at 490, “… is whether the claimant could reasonably have been expected to file earlier.” The respondent has not explained why she waited approximately 5 years to seek reopening. In addition, the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for seeking reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Roberto G. Culas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeff Lindblad
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler.
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s June 1, 2006, decision ordering him removed from the United States as an alien who has knowingly assisted another alien to enter the United States in violation of law. See section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) (2000). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the attorney who represented the respondent during his proceedings before the Immigration Judge provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file an asylum application on the respondent’s behalf and by failing to investigate whether the respondent was in fact removable as charged. We dismiss the respondent’s appeal for several reasons. As a threshold matter, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor does the record show such a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance” as to warrant consideration of his claim despite his failure to comply with those requirements. Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587-88 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000)). In this connection, we note that the respondent— while sworn—repeatedly admitted to the Immigration Judge that he had knowingly assisted another alien to enter the United States in violation of law, thereby supporting the charge of removability (Tr. at 15-16, 39-40). Moreover, although he initially stated that he had a fear of persecution or torture in El Salvador (Tr. at 17), he specifically disavowed that assertion—again, while sworn—in two subsequent hearings. (Tr. at 42, 45). Absent truly compelling circumstances not present here, an attorney does not provide ineffective assistance by declining to pursue lines of inquiry or forms of relief that have been expressly foreclosed by the sworn testimony of the client.
 
Finally, the respondent has not provided persuasive evidence of prejudice arising from counsel’s allegedly deficient performance, i.e, evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different had counsel provided more proficient representation. Ray v. Gonzales, supra, at 587; Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-26 (9th Cir. 2003). Specifically, the respondent has offered no evidence, either before the Immigration Judge or in connection with his appeal to this Board, to suggest that the charge of removability is unfounded or that he is in fact eligible for asylum despite his representations that he has no fear of persecution or torture in El Salvador. Although the respondent’s appellate brief contains a statement of counsel indicating that he conceded removability in order to protect his estranged spouse, who he claims was the real “culprit” in his alien smuggling activity, such statements by counsel are not evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
*2 Because the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is deficient on its face, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary D. Olive, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i) (I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s June 3, 2005, decision ordering him removed from the United States to his native Guatemala as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. See section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). On appeal, the respondent alleges that he was deprived of his right to a full and fair removal hearing because of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he contends that his prior attorney was ineffective because he failed to arrange for the filing of an immigrant visa petition (Form I-130) on the respondent’s behalf, which could have formed the basis for a subsequent application for adjustment of status in Immigration Court had it been approved, and because he failed to inform the Immigration Judge that petitions for writs of coram nobis had been filed on his behalf in state court for the purpose of securing a vacatur of the convictions underlying the charge of removability.
 
As with all claims in which an alien argues that his “due process rights” were violated in removal proceedings, an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must show that he was prejudiced by the allegedly defective representation. Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005). Assuming arguendo that prior counsel’s failure to file the aforementioned documents on the respondent’s behalf constituted ineffective assistance, we conclude that the respondent has failed to demonstrate the requisite prejudice. Specifically, in the more than 14 months since the Immigration Judge rendered her decision in this matter, we have received no indication from the respondent that his criminal convictions have been vacated or modified in any way or that he has become the beneficiary of a visa petition that would form the basis for an adjustment of status application if approved.1 Accordingly, the respondent has not shown that prior counsel’s allegedly deficient performance had any effect at all on the outcome of his proceedings. In the absence of evidence indicating that there is any present basis for the respondent to challenge the validity of the charge of removability or to demonstrate that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status, we see no constructive purpose in remanding this matter for further proceedings.
 
The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rev. Michael R. Sciumbato, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mindy E. Hoeppner
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 5, 2006, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Subsequent to filing a notice of appeal, the respondent filed a motion to rescind and reopen with the Immigration Court on June 28, 2006. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on January 31, 2006. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear due to the disconnection of his cellular telephone, which resulted in the inability of the respondent’s former counsel to contact him regarding the new hearing date; and due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel. Specifically, the respondent contends that his former counsel failed to inform him in writing of his next scheduled hearing, despite the fact that his former counsel was aware of the respondent’s current address. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish exceptional circumstances based on his claim that his cellular telephone was disconnected, and therefore, his former attorney was unable to contact him on his cellular telephone to inform him of the new hearing date. The respondent failed to provide any evidence regarding the dates of the alleged disconnection or the reason for the disconnection. Moreover, the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances due to disconnection of a cellular telephone does not qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” as defined section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
On appeal the respondent is represented by new counsel and now alleges ineffective assistance of counsel as the basis for his failure to appear. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) are satisfied. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal, including his affidavit, a letter to his former attorney informing him of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, and a complaint letter to the Utah State Bar Disciplinary Committee. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). However, we find such evidence probative of the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances due to ineffective assistance of counsel and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of this issue only. Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Duane Montano, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bonnie K. Brady,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen the proceeding to apply for adjustment of status based on his status as the spouse of a deceased United States citizen as provided in section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2).1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
An Immigration Judge has limited authority to hear an application for adjustment of status in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1). Relevant to the instant matter, the regulations provide that although there is no direct appeal from the decision of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deny an adjustment application, the “applicant, if not an arriving alien, retains the right to renew his or her application” in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(5).
 
The record reflects that by notice (Form I- 191) dated December 5, 2002, the district direct of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the DHS) denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status.2 He is not now, however, seeking to renew that application; rather, the respondent has ignored the renewal procedure authorized in the regulations and is seeking reopening to apply for adjustment of status based on an entirely different visa petition. See Matter of Lasike, 17 I&N Dec. 445 (BIA 1980) (holding that an application may be considered “renewed” only when based on the same facts and reviewed according to circumstances as they existed when the original application was filed). We find no legal authority in the Act or in the regulations, and the respondent has not provided any legal authority, that permits him to seek adjustment of status based on a self-petition where, as here, the alien is in removal proceedings and a previously filed adjustment application has been denied by the DHS.
 
In any event, the respondent failed to support his motion to reopen with a completed application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) with supporting evidentiary material. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent has not shown that his self-petition has been approved or that he is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition filed by his now deceased United States citizen wife. See section 245 of the Act; Matter of Perez Vargas, 23 I&N Dec. 829 (BIA 2005) (The DHS has sole authority to adjudicate a visa petition.). Further, he has not provided any evidentiary material to show the likelihood that he will succeed in demonstrating the statutory requirements for a self-petition under section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. Consequently, the respondent has failed to provide prima facie proof of eligibility for adjustment of status under the Act. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992); Matter of Sipus, 14 I&N Dec. 229 (BIA 1972).
 
*2 The respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process by failing to inform him of the relief available to him during the removal hearing is foreclosed by United States v. Aguirre-Tello, 353 F.3d 1199 (10th Cir. 2004). In that decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the circuit in which this cases arises, decided that a deportable alien does not have a constitutional right to be informed of discretionary relief that might be available to him or her. See id., at 1204. To the extent that the respondent is asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former counsel for “inexcusable neglect,” the claim fails because the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

According to the Form I-191, the respondent failed to provide information concerning his convictions on February 28, 2001, and on March 18, 2002, for domestic abuse of his now deceased United States citizen wife.

Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on June 10, 2005, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).
 
On March 29, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. He also asks for a stay of voluntary departure.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s motion. It asserts that the respondent’s motion is not supported by material, previously unavailable evidence that supports reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing). The DHS also asserts that the respondent’s underlying approved immediate relative visa petition was automatically revoked when the petitioner, the respondent’s United States citizen spouse, died. See 8 C.F.R. § 205.1 (a)(3)(i)(C). Consequently, it asserts that the respondent is no longer statutorily eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).
 
Initially, we observe that the respondent’s March 29, 2006, motion to reopen is time barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened). A final administrative order was entered in this case on June 10, 2005.
 
The respondent argues that the motions deadline should be equitably tolled based on his claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, Mr. James White. The respondent asserts that Mr. White failed to inform him of the status of his appeal and of his right to file a motion to reopen. The respondent has provided a declaration in which he claims that he first learned that this Board dismissed his appeal on February 10, 2006, during an interview with DHS officers. See Respondent’s Motion at 2. The respondent also correctly asserts that Mr. White was suspended from the practice of law in Oregon effective December 10, 2005, and was suspended from practice before this Board and the Immigration Courts effective January 11, 2006. See Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals dated January 11, 2006. The respondent states that complete compliance with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), is unnecessary where, as here, the ineffectiveness is clear from the record.
 
*2 Equitable tolling of the time limits for motions to reopen is available to aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). We find that equitable tolling is appropriate in this case where the respondent substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, established that his case was prejudiced as a result of Mr. White’s misconduct, and, diligently filed this motion to reopen within a month of learning that his appeal was dismissed.
 
We now turn to the merits of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status. The DHS asserts that the respondent is no longer eligible for adjustment because his underlying visa petition was automatically revoked on the death of his United States citizen spouse.
 
However, pursuant to section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), if the alien was the spouse of a United States citizen for two years before the citizen’s death and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen’s death, the alien shall be considered to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen’s death but only if the spouse files a petition under 204(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(ii), with in two years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries. Although it is unclear when the respondent’s wife died, it appears that the respondent may be eligible for file a visa petition under this provision.
 
The respondent was granted a period of voluntary departure by this Board pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act. Such period of voluntary departure ended on August 9, 2005. The respondent failed to depart the United States during such time period. In most cases, an alien who fails to depart the United States within the time period specified in a voluntary departure order is, by virtue of that failure, rendered ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of 10 years. See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). In this case, however, respondent’s failure to voluntarily depart or file a timely motion within the voluntary departure period was due to the clear ineffectiveness assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we find that the respondent is not barred from relief by operation of section 240B(d) of the Act. See generally Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding “that in cases in which a motion to reopen is filed within the voluntary departure period and a stay of removal or voluntary departure is requested, the voluntary departure period is tolled during the period the ¿Boardº is considering the motion”).
 
*3 Based on the foregoing we find it appropriate to grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent can apply for adjustment of status and any other form of relief from removal for which he can establish eligibility. The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeremiah Wolf-Stuchiner, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; remand
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board of Immigration Appeals on May 26, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent now moves for reconsideration of our decision, and also requests that the record be remanded to the Immigration Judge so that he may apply for relief from removal. The motion will be denied.
 
On July 6, 2004, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States after denying his application for a waiver of deportability under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994). The respondent did not file an appeal from that decision, and therefore it became a final administrative order of removal in August of 2004, upon expiration of the 30-day deadline for filing appeals with this Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39 (2004). In October of 2004 the respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, alleging that his failure to file an appeal was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and requesting that the Immigration Judge reopen the proceedings and reissue his decision. On October 22, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the motion, and the respondent appealed. In our decision of May 26, 2006, we concluded that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen did not constitute reversible error because the respondent had not suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorney’s failure to appeal. Specifically, we concluded that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver was not erroneous, particularly in light of the serious adverse discretionary factors present in his case. The respondent seeks reconsideration.
 
A motion to reconsider before this Board must specify the errors of fact or law contained in the previous order and must be supported by pertinent authority. See section 240(c)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(5)(C) (2000); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (2006). In his motion, the respondent simply asserts that he is statutorily eligible for section 212(c) relief, an issue that we questioned in a footnote in our May 26, 2006, decision. See Matter of Blake, 23 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 2005). Yet the respondent does not seriously dispute the central point of our decision, i.e., that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that he did not merit section 212(c) relief in the exercise of discretion, thereby precluding him from establishing prejudice in connection with his failure to appeal. We continue to espouse that position, and find that our decision of May 26, 2006, contained no material legal or factual error that would warrant reconsideration. We now turn to the respondent’s motion to remand.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent’s seeks a remand to apply for relief from removal, his motion will be denied because it is both untimely and number-barred. This Board’s motions regulation provides in pertinent part that “an alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). As we noted previously, the final administrative decision in this case was the Immigration Judge’s July 6, 2004, decision ordering the respondent removed and denying his request for a section 212(c) waiver. The respondent already filed one motion to reopen that decision in October of 2004 with the Immigration Judge, and therefore his present motion to remand is number-barred. Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 2000) (motions to remand are simply motions to reopen filed after appeal has been perfected, and they are subject to the same temporal and numerical limitations as other motions to reopen). Furthermore, the present motion is untimely because it was filed in June of 2006, significantly more than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered.1
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The 90-day regulatory filing deadline is not measured from this Board’s May 26, 2006, decision, which merely affirmed the Immigration Judge’s refusal to disturb the finality of the July 2004 removal order. The respondent does not obtain a new 90-day motion deadline by filing a meritless appeal from the denial of a prior motion. Cf. Matter of Oparah, supra.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard David Rogen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Barbara A. Hale
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent has filed an appeal from a May 1, 2006, decision of an Immigration Judge which found him removable as charged, ineligible for cancellation of removal for nonpermanent residents, and ordered him removed to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has replied that the decision of the Immigration Judge should be affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was ordered deported from the United States in 1989, as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation, after a hearing held in absentia in Los Angeles. The respondent did not appeal this order, and he was deported in 1990. The respondent subsequently reentered the United States, and was placed in these removal proceedings pursuant to a Notice to Appear dated July 11, 2005. During the course of the removal proceedings, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings in Los Angeles based on ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The removal proceedings were continued on at least one occasion to see how the motion fared in the other court (see Tr. at 39). By the time of the final removal hearing, the motion to reopen deportation proceedings had been denied by the Immigration Judge in Los Angeles for a lack of jurisdiction.
 
The Immigration Judge in the instant case found the respondent removable as charged upon his admission that he was born abroad, and his failure to provide any evidence about his last entry into the United States. He also found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal for nonpermanent residents due to his several convictions for controlled substance violations, and ordered him removed to Mexico.
 
The only issue raised on appeal is the respondent’s contention that his removal proceedings should have been continued by the Immigration Judge until his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings had been fully adjudicated. He points out that the Board dismissed his appeal of the denied motion on June 16, 2006, and that he now has an appeal pending with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
 
On review, we find that the Immigration Judge acted within his discretion in not continuing the removal proceedings pending further adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (2006). The respondent’s motion to reopen arose in separate proceedings, and addressed a deportation order which was executed over 15 years earlier. Further, the Immigration Judge did in fact delay the proceedings to see what happened with the motion, and it had been denied at the time of the final removal hearing. The respondent is a detained alien, and the Immigration Judge acted appropriately in not indefinitely delaying the removal proceedings.2 Similarly, we reject the respondent’s argument that this Board should postpone its decision in these removal proceedings pending resolution of the appeal filed with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The respondent’s appeal will accordingly be dismissed.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent argued that he was prejudiced because he would have pursued a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).

2

We also consider the Immigration Judge’s finding that regardless of what occurred with the motion to reopen the deportation proceedings, the respondent still had no proof that he was inspected and admitted at the time of his last entry into the United States.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Michael Harper
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony pursuant to section 101(a)(43)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B)º

Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
  
APPLICATION: Dismissal of Aggravated Felony Charge
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 22, 2006, decision that ordered him removed from the United States as an alien convicted of aggravated felonies, controlled substance Violations, and two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. See sections 101(a)(43)(B), 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). During the pendency of the appeal the respondent submitted a motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
The respondent requests that his claim be remanded in order for the Immigration Judge to consider legal arguments regarding his eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). He contends that his previous counsel failed to raise established legal precedent, and further compounded his error by conceding that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony, prejudicing the respondent’s claim in its entirety. He argues that the professional incompetence of the counsel representing him in Immigration Court deprived the respondent of due process. The respondent’s current counsel indicated in an affidavit that a complaint had been filed with the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission against the respondent’s former counsel, and that a copy of the complaint had been supplied to the respondent’s former counsel.
 
Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada).
 
*2 While the respondent has indicated that he is attempting to comply with the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arises, has held that, in addition to meeting the procedural requirements, an alien must also show prejudice. The Seventh Circuit held in Kay v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 664 (7th Cir. 2004) that an alien seeking to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show that the alleged errors likely affected the outcome of the proceeding. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 558 (BIA 2003) (finding that the respondent had failed to show the requisite prejudiceto warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.) While the respondent argues that there was ineffective assistance of counsel because his previous counsel conceded that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent does not suggest that, had previous counsel not done so, the outcome would have been affected, particularly in light of the Immigration Judge’s analysis, and current legal precedent. Moreover, the respondent has not indicated what arguments he would have presented before the Immigration Judge that would have changed the outcome of the proceedings. Accordingly, as the respondent was not shown, by the previous counsel’s conduct, to have experienced actual prejudice during the course of the proceeding before the Immigration Judge, there can be no ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit, and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
Turning to the underlying issues on appeal, the respondent is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The record reflects that on or about November 14, 2003, he entered a plea of guilty in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS), for which he was sentenced to 12 months court supervision. Furthermore, on October 13, 2005, he was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; on November 10, 2005, he was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS, and on January 27, 2006, he was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS (Gp. Exh. 2). Based on these convictions, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was removable as an alien who has been convicted of aggravated felonies under section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act, rendering him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(3).
 
*3 After reviewing the respondent’s appellate arguments, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. The Seventh Circuit has held that an alien’s state drug conviction, which is a felony under state law, but which only qualifies as a misdemeanor under federal law, is not an aggravated felony under section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act. See Gonzales-Gomez v. Achim, 441 F.3d 532 (7th Cir. 2006). However, the Seventh Circuit subsequenttly held, in Tunis v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2006), that a drug offense, state or federal, that would be punishable as a felony under federal law, is an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.
 
Under this precedent, the respondent’s 2005 and 2006 convictions plainly qualify as aggravated felonies because, with his 2003 conviction final, his subsequent convictions for possession of a controlled substance violate the Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. § 802 et seq., and are punishable as felonies under the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. § 844. In short, the Immigration Judge’s legal conclusion in the respondent’s case is correct under applicable legal standards. The respondent is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony, making him ineligible for cancellation of removal.1
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

We are not aware of a Seventh Circuit ruling involving two simple possession convictions. But the respondent’s second possession offense was punishable as a felony had it been prosecuted, following federal procedural requirements, in federal court. While we do not know how a federal prosecutor would have prosecuted this offense, the respondent did commit a felony violation of the CSA. See Gonzales-Gomez v. Achim, supra, at 534-35.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
CARLOS A. CRUZ
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 31, 2006. The record reflects that the respondent was given, in court, the notice of the next hearing date and the consequences for a failure to appear. He failed to appear for his hearing on November 20, 1990. He was ordered to be deported in proceedings conducted in absentia.
 
More than 14 years later, he submitted a motion to reopen to apply for benefits under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). He claimed that his notary advised him that he would be deported if he went to the hearing. He stated that his fear of deportation, limited education, and the false information from his notary establish reasonable cause and exceptional circumstances for reopening regardless of timeliness, citing Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, as well as his subsequent motion to reconsider. She distinguished Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, from the respondent’s case. She found that the respondent had not established ineffective assistance of counsel or non-attorney fraud so as to warrant reopening. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). She concluded that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely, his NACARA application was untimely and not supported by evidence that he is eligible for such relief, and he had not shown due diligence so as to warrant equitable tolling of the time limits for such motions.
 
On appeal, the respondent states that he is not claiming ineffective assistance. He asserts that his fear, his limited education, and his faith in the notary who deceived him amount to reasonable cause and exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening under Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, without regard to timeliness. We are persuaded that our decision in Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, is applicable here, and that the respondent’s motion is not untimely. The correct standard for reopening the respondent’s in absentia proceedings is “reasonable cause,” not “exceptional circumstances.” We find that the respondent has not demonstrated a reasonable cause for his failure to appear. Moreover, he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and he has not shown diligence in these proceedings. We find no basis for reopening the respondent’s deportation proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board when the respondent appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings conducted in absentia. On November 29, 2005, we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal to support her allegations that she failed to appear at her scheduled hearing of May 10, 2005, on account of the ineffective assistance of her prior attorney. On remand, the Immigration Judge noted that the directives in the Board’s decision were subject to various interpretations. Nevertheless, the Immigration Judge also noted that the respondent’s evidence was insufficient to establish her burden of proof for reopening her proceedings. Therefore, the Immigration Judge certified the case back to the Board for clarification. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
As a preliminary matter, we clarify that our intent on remanding the record to the Immigration Judge was to consider the evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal to determine whether it adequately established that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, warranting rescission of the removal order entered against her in absentia. We did not intend to reopen the proceedings without proper consideration of the evidence by the Immigration Judge.
 
Consequently, in reviewing the Immigration Judge’s ultimate conclusion that the evidence does not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that neither party submitted briefs in response to the Immigration Judge’s certification of this case. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(c) and 1003.7. The Immigration Judge determined that the letter submitted by respondent’s former counsel, John F. Lenderman, in support of the respondent’s appeal, raised several questions regarding possible collusion between the respondent and counsel in making an alleged claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge’ s decision has not been shown to be clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). In addition, given the respondent’s failure to meet the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s conclusion in this case. See generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION/APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joy H. Huang, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sandra B, Myles
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 12, 2006, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his case following a hearing held on June 24, 1993, in which he was ordered deported in absentia, as untimely filed and failing to comply with the requirements for a claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to section 242B(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c), an order of deportation entered in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to circumstances beyond the respondent’s control, such as a serious illness or the death of a member of the respondent’s immediate family. See, e.g., Mailer of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that his failure to appear for his scheduled hearing was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, who he later discovered was not an attorney, and that therefore the in absentia order should be rescinded due to “exceptional circumstances.” Specifically, the respondent contends that this individual not only failed to inform him that he had a scheduled hearing which resulted in the order of deportation being entered in his absence, but also advised him that his case had been closed and that he did not need to appear for any hearings.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit wherein this case arises, has held that equitable tolling of a filing deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf, Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999)(finding that statute of limitations for reopening an in absentia order of deportation is tolled as an equitable matter where the late filing of the motion is attributed to the deceptive actions of a notary posing as an attorney, but diligence must be shown). In the matter before us, we fail to find the respondent exercised diligence in filing his motion to reopen. His motion to reopen was filed more than 13 years after the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia deportation order. According to the respondent, a non-attorney told him “that his case was closed and that ¿heº did not need to appear in any court hearing any more.” The respondent contends that he did not learn of the Immigration Judge’ s order of deportation until he began the process to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident, based on his approved employment-related immigrant visa petition, in 2001. The respondent paid a substantial bond in order to released from detention in 1993. He fails to reveal if he took any steps to have the money returned to him in the intervening 13 years. Only after he was detained based on the outstanding order of deportation did the respondent express an interest in what had transpired 13 years before. Consequently, we find the respondent did not exercise diligence in waiting more than 13 years to investigate his immigration status. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra; Lopez v. INS, supra.
 
*2 Even if the respondent’s motion were to be accepted as having been timely filed with the Immigration Judge, it fails to even minimally assert a proper ineffective assistance claim. See Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 2002) (examining the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in a claim of ineffective assistance by non-attorneys); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements may be sufficient in some circumstances).
 
The respondent alleges that he wrote a letter containing his accusations of ineffective assistance to the non-attorney and contacted the California State Bar Association. However, he presented no evidence in support of the allegations. Taking such a step would have provided the non-attorney with an opportunity to provide his own version of events. Alternatively, if the mailing was returned by the postal service as undeliverable, the returned mailing would have at least supported the respondent’s claim that he could not locate him. Moreover, the respondent has not presented a copy of a contract or agreement with this individual indicating what services were to be performed by him. We therefore find that the motion provides an inadequate basis from which to conclude that the non-attorney failed to provide services that he had agreed to provide which constituted ineffective assistance and prejudiced the respondent. See generally Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin with determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance).
 
In addition, we find the respondent’s claims as to ineffective assistance of counsel, did not relieve him of the responsibility of notifying the Immigration Court as to any address changes. The respondent was required to provide written notice of any change in his address to the Immigration Court within 5 working days of the actual change. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.15(c)(2) (1993). The Order to Show Cause explained this requirement, and the respondent was also provided oral notice of the same in his native language. Because the respondent failed to comply with his responsibility to advise the Immigration Court of any change in address, and as the notice of hearing was sent to the most recent address provided by the respondent (and not his attorney as he claims on appeal), we conclude that the Immigration Judge was correct to proceed in absentia, and we see no reason the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order should be rescinded. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(b)(2)(1993); see also 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(c)(1993) (noting that written notice to the most recent address contained in the Record of Proceeding shall be considered sufficient).
 
*3 Finally, even though the respondent demonstrated that he is eligible for a form of relief from deportation which was not available at his hearing in this case adjustment of status, the respondent’s situation does not fall within the purview of our decision in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). First, in Matter of M-S-, we held that an alien who fails to appear at his or her hearing and who had not received oral warnings of the consequences for a failure to appear, could have proceedings reopened in order to pursue a form of relief which was not available at the time of the hearing so long as the motion to reopen met the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c) and 3.23(b) (1998). In this case, the certificate of service on the Order to Show Cause (form I-221) (Exh. 1) indicates that it was personally served upon the respondent and that a Service officer read the contents of the document to the respondent in Mandarin, his native language. The consequences for failing to appear at a hearing are listed on page 4 of the Order to Show Cause and therefore are part of the contents read to him. The respondent signed the form at the bottom of page 5 acknowledging that it was read and given to him. Thus, the respondent received oral notice of the consequences for failure to appear at a hearing.
 
Second, the respondent’s motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge was filed on May 2, 2006. This is a date well after the September 30, 1996, deadline for the submission of a motion to reopen proceedings in which the final administrative order from the Immigration Judge was dated June 24, 1993. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). As such, it is clearly untimely. Id.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal of the denial of his motion to reopen is dismissed.
