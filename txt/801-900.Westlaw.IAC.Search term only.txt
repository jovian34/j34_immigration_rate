IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
M. Omar Chaudhry, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a December 29, 2010, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order entered on March 10, 2010. The respondent has appealed this decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has requested that the Immigration Judge’s decision be affirmed. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
It is undisputed that the respondent was personally and properly served with notice of his March 10, 2010, hearing. It is also undisputed that the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order that was based on a claim of exceptional circumstances was filed on October 25, 2010, more than 180 days after the March 10, 2010, removal order was issued against him and was therefore untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal issued on March 10, 2010. There is a discrepancy in the record between the respondent’s claim in his affidavit that he relied on the advice of an individual whom he identified only as “Michael” and filings made on his behalf, which includes an asylum application and motions to change venue, that showed they were filed with the assistance of an attorney named Victor D. Ocampo (“Ocampo”). Neither the respondent’s affidavit nor the motion made any attempt to resolve this discrepancy. We note, moreover, that we cannot be confident of the accuracy and reliability of the respondent’s affidavit, as it misstated the date of his hearing in many of his key averments (see “Affidavit in Support,” ¶¶ 8,11,12). Based on this record, we agree with the Immigration Judge’ s ultimate determination that the affidavit the respondent submitted with his motion did not establish that exceptional circumstances caused his failure to appear for his hearing, or that the 180-day deadline for the motion should be equitably tolled. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
To the extent that the respondent on appeal has advanced new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against attorney Ocampo, we cannot consider such claims for the first time on appeal, and the respondent did not otherwise file or satisfied the requirements of a motion to remand (Respondent’s Br. at 5). See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 197 n.4 (BIA 1990); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Contrary to the respondent’s argument, moreover, we cannot conclude that the respondent established that ineffective assistance of counsel was obvious on the face of the record, which included the respondent’s inconsistent affidavit, such that may have excused the respondent from complying with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that failure to comply with the Lozada requirements is not fatal where the alleged ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the record). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jamie B. Naini, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scot A. Bearup
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, timely appeals a July 26, 2011, decision by the Immigration Judge denying reopening of his February 23, 2011, decision which granted voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the appeal. The respondent filed a request for stay of removal which was denied by the Board on September 15, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s June 2011 motion to reopen was untimely and that the respondent has not presented an exception to the filing deadline under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4) (I.J. at 2). We agree that the respondent did not present any argument or submit any evidence regarding changed country conditions in Mexico (I.J. at 3). On appeal, the respondent refers to the application for asylum he filed with his motion to reopen, and his claim that he would be in danger if returned to Mexico (Resp. Br. at 13-14). However, he did not allege that there had been changed country conditions from the time he accepted voluntary departure and when he filed his motion to reopen.
 
He also contends ineffective assistance of counsel against his prior counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge for not advising him of the forms of relief available to him (Resp. Br. at 5; Motion at 3). However, we agree that he has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10(1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 3-4). He has not submitted evidence that his former counsel was contacted regarding the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel and he has not filed a complaint regarding his former counsel’s performance with the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
The respondent was granted voluntary departure under section 240B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1), which requires the respondent to expressly waive his right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301, 1304-05 (BIA 2000). The respondent contends that he did not expressly waive his right to appeal (Resp. Br. at 7-10).
 
*2 Even if the respondent has properly preserved the issue for our consideration, after reviewing the transcript of the February 23, 2011, hearing, we conclude that the respondent accepted voluntary departure and effectively waived appeal. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure until June 22, 2011 (Tr. at 6). The Immigration Judge, at the end of the hearing, asked the respondent’s attorney, “respondent waives and accepts?” (Tr. at 7). The respondent’s attorney then answered in the affirmative. Our Ocampo decision stands for the proposition that the record must contain an express indication that an alien has waived his appellate rights. However, no particular wording is required to establish that the alien effectively waived the right to appeal. There is no indication in the record of any misunderstanding or confusion on the part of the respondent or his then counsel on this point.
 
Regarding the respondent’s assertion that the matter should be reopened on a sua sponte basis, he did not make this argument to the Immigration Judge in his motion to reopen. See Matter of Fedorenko, supra. Furthermore, the circumstances that the respondent described would not warrant reopening on a sua sponte basis.
 
On appeal, the respondent has submitted additional evidence regarding drug violence in Mexico. This Board, however, is an appellate body whose function is to review, not create, a record, and thus it would generally be inappropriate for us to accept this “new” evidence to supplement the record. See Matter of Fedorenko, supra. Any party seeking further fact-finding pursuant to newly-submitted evidence must file a motion to remand. In this case, the respondent has not done so.
 
If we were to construe the submission of new evidence as a motion to remand, we would deny it. The requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen. Rodriguez v. INS, 841 F.2d 865 (9th Cir. 1987). Specifically, “[a] motion to reopen [or remand] proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent must show that the evidence would establish his prima facie eligibility for relief or affect the outcome of the case. Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413,419 (BIA (1996); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Most of the evidence that the respondent submitted was not previously unavailable; it could have been filed with the motion to reopen. Also, the two articles which postdate the motion to reopen discuss drug violence, but do not show that the respondent would be targeted on account of a protected ground (Exhs. E, F).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX4 303 - Los Fresnos, TX
January 17, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa Brodyaga, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason Goodchild
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s decision of July 1, 2011, which dismissed his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s April 23, 2009, decision pretermitting his application for adjustment of status. See section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion first contends that we failed to properly consider his argument on appeal that, due to intervening decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the board is no longer obliged to follow the decision of the Attorney General in this case. Resp. Motion at 3; Matter of Silva-Trevino, 24 I&N Dec. 687 (A.G. 2008); Nijhawan v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. 2294 (2009); Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 284 (5th Cir. 2007). We disagree.
 
As stated in our prior decision, Nijhawan v. Holder, supra, held that in the context of determining whether an offense constitutes an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), the threshold amount of loss ($10,000) can be proven by reference to evidence outside the formal record of conviction. The respondent extrapolates from this that elements of moral turpitude (of which fraud is an example), cannot be established through such evidence. However, the Supreme Court did not rule on that question in the context presented in this case: that of determining whether an offense is a crime involving moral turpitude. The Attorney General explained that this determination presents legal questions distinct from those involved in a determination under the aggravated felony ground of deportability, and specifically limited his decision to determinations of moral turpitude. Matter of Silva-Trevino, supra, at 701-02, 704. Nothing in Nijhawan mandates or warrants a departure from the ruling of the Attorney General.
 
Neither are we persuaded that Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, supra, compels us not to follow Matter of Silva-Trevino. That decision, issued prior to Silva-Trevino, reflected the categorical approach, and focused on the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute. The Attorney General explicitly recognized that this was the rule in the Fifth Circuit, as well as the Third Circuit, and contrasted that approach with that followed in other circuits, notably the Seventh. Matter of Silva-Trevino, supra, at 693-95. The Attorney General explicitly sought to establish a uniform rule of decision, and thus mandated that it be applied by the Board and by Immigration Judges in all circuits. Id. at 694-95. The Fifth Circuit has not yet addressed the question in a published decision, and we thus remain bound to follow the decision of the Attorney General. See Matter of Guevara Alfaro, 25 I&N Dec. 417,420 (BIA 2011).1
 
*2 The respondent also contends that our prior decision misconstrued his due process arguments. Resp. Motion at 5. In our July 1, 2011, decision, we stated that the Immigration Judge properly limited proceedings on remand to the legal issue of whether the respondent’s crime involved moral turpitude, rather than allowing additional testimony and evidence to be taken regarding discretion. We continue to adhere to that view. As noted by both the respondent and the DHS, on remand the Immigration Judge allowed the respondent to place further evidence in the record regardless of whether it related to application of the Silva-Trevino framework (March 12, 2009, Hearing, Tr. at 8-11). Respondent’s Motion at 6; DHS Opposition Br. at 3-4. The respondent was also permitted to make an opening statement in which he addressed his due process claims (April 23, 2009, Hearing, Tr. at 18-19). Furthermore, although the respondent states that it was necessary for him to put on oral testimony, he has not explained why he could not provide supporting evidence in the form of personal documents, affidavits, and statements. Thus, we find that the respondent was given an adequate opportunity to preserve his constitutional arguments regarding substantive due process for review by the Fifth Circuit, and the respondent has not sufficiently demonstrated that his immigration proceedings were procedurally deficient or caused him to suffer prejudice. See Zhang v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 339, 346-47 (5th Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent also repeats his argument that retroactive application of Matter of Silva-Trevino to his case violates his substantive due process rights because of his individual circumstances which include, inter alia, his lengthy residence in the United States, advanced age, lack of prior criminal history, loss of government benefits, and hardship to his wife. However, we disagree with the respondent that his substantive due process claims are factually based defenses which the Immigration Judge should have considered in the first instance. Resp. Motion at 6; See Cantu-Delgadillo v. Holder, 584 F.3d 682, 687 (5th Cir. 2009) (circuit court and not the Board or Immigration Judge have jurisdiction to consider an alien’s substantive due process claims). The Immigration Judge followed the Attorney General’s directives, and neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has the authority to reach arguments regarding the constitutionality of the Attorney General’s interpretation of the Act. See, e.g., Matter of Cruz De Ortiz, 25 I&N Dec. 601, 605 (BIA 2011).
 
Additionally, the respondent asserts that Matter of Silva-Trevino violates his due process rights pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), and other Fifth Circuit cases discussing agency rule making, because the decision retroactively changes the process by which it is determined whether his offense involves moral turpitude after he entered into a plea agreement. Resp. Motion at 8. However, for the reasons set forth infra, we are bound by the Attorney General’s approach and cannot address the respondent’s constitutional arguments in opposition to the Attorney General’s decision.2
 
*3 Finally, the respondent’s argument that we failed to address how the Attorney General radically and improperly changed the definition of “conviction” in Matter of Silva-Trevino is likewise beyond our authority to address.
 
Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we do not find the respondent to have shown any error of law or fact that would alter the outcome of our prior decision. See section 240(c)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (2012).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Although the Fifth Circuit referred to prior case law regarding its analysis of crimes involving moral turpitude (CTMTs) in Bianco v. Holder, 624 F.3d 265 (5th Cir. 2010), ultimately at issue in that case was whether the alien was deportable based on a conviction for a crime of domestic violence. See section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). Furthermore, there are circuit courts of appeal which have expressly indicated that the Matter of Silva-Trevino framework will not be applied. See, e.g., Jean-Louis v. Attorney General of the United States, 582 F.3d 462, 470-71 (3d Cir. 2009). However, the Fifth Circuit has not done so at this time.

2

The respondent maintains that the Board misconstrued his retroactivity argument as asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. Resp. Motion at 2, 14-15. The Board’s reference to Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), was in response to the respondent’s claim that he pled no contest to his offense without awareness of its immigration consequences. We acknowledge the respondent’s motion as clarifying that he did not intend to make an ineffective assistance of counsel argument.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mariya Zarakhovich, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a motion to reconsider on July 7, 2011. She seeks to have the Board reconsider its decision of June 8, 2011, which itself declined to reconsider a November 29, 2010, decision of the Board dismissing her appeal as untimely. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The Board’s June 8, 2011, decision considered that the respondent’s motion to reconsider was untimely filed. Section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). A motion to reconsider the Board’s November 29, 2010, decision was due by December 29, 2010, but was not submitted until January 4, 2011, was rejected for a filing defect, and filed on January 12, 2011. In any event, we concluded, the regulations clearly provide that the time for filing an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision runs from the date the decision is mailed, not the day that the decision is received. 8C.F.R. § 1003.38(b). Therefore, the motion to reconsider was denied on June 8, 2011.
 
The pending motion exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reconsider. A party is limited to one motion to reconsider. Section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Moreover, a party may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).
 
The respondent’s counsel argues again that the appeal was filed late due to her mistake in calendaring the due date. In Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006), aff’d Liadov v. Mukasey, 518 F.3d 1003 (8th Cir. 2008), the Board concluded that it has the authority to consider a late appeal by certification under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c), under appropriate circumstances, where exceptional circumstances are present. However, counsel’s failure to properly manage her cases does not excuse the failure to file a timely appeal. To the extent that counsel brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against herself, she has failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Swaray Conteh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Nigeria. At the hearing before the Immigration Judge on January 13, 2010, she and her husband, who is also a native and citizen of Nigeria, reached an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in which the DHS agreed to withdraw a charge of removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act alleging that they attempted to obtain admission into the United States by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.1 In exchange, the couple accepted a final order of removal pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. On February 10, 2011, the respondent filed a Motion to Reopen arguing that her agreement with the DHS was not voluntary. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on April 7, 2010. The respondent now appeals that decision.2 We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent contends that her agreement with the DHS was not voluntary and that the Immigration Judge did not accurately explain the law to the respondent. See Respondent’s Brief at 6. Despite this contention, however, the transcript indicates that the Immigration Judge asked the respondent if she voluntarily agreed to concede that she abandoned her lawful permanent resident status and to accept a final removal order in exchange for the DHS’s agreement to withdraw the charge of removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (Tr. at 7-8). The respondent responded several times inaudibly and ultimately said “Yes.” (Tr. at 8). The Immigration Judge asked the respondent if she understood that this would terminate her permanent resident status and the respondent said “I do know.” (Tr. at 8-9). The Immigration Judge also explained that the DHS was dropping the fraud charge (Tr. at 9). The Immigration Judge asked the respondent whether the details of the agreement were explained to her and if she “made this decision considering all of the factors and with the legal advice of [her] attorney.” (Tr. at 9). The respondent said “Right.” (Tr. at 9).3 As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent was upset when she answered the Immigration Judge’s questions (I.J. at 2). Nonetheless, she indicated that she understood this agreement.
 
*2 The respondent also argues that, pursuant to Hill v. City of Cleveland, 12 F.3d 575 (6th Cir. 1993) and Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386 (1987), the respondent’s agreement was not entered voluntarily. See Respondent’s Brief at 7-10. We note, however, that these cases involved the rights of criminal defendants to enter a “release-dismissal agreement.” Further, pursuant to the factors listed in Hill, supra, in this case the respondent was not in custody when she entered the agreement, she was advised by counsel, and the agreement was entered into under the Immigration Judge’s supervision. See Hill, supra, at 578.
 
Further, to the extent that the respondent argues that her attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that the respondent did not attempt to satisfy the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board to apply the Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Given the evidence presented, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

The DHS contends that the respondent and her husband misrepresented that they had been out of the United States for only 2 weeks when they were in Nigeria for 14 months (I.J. at 2). See Exh. A attached to DHS’s Answer to Motion to Reopen.

2

The respondent’s husband accepted the Immigration Judge’s decision as final (Tr. at 12).

3

The Immigration Judge stated that the DHS would withdraw the fraud charge which would otherwise be “a permanent bar” to the respondent’s return (Tr. at 9). As the respondent argues, the Immigration Judge did not discuss possible waivers with the respondent. See Respondent’s Brief at 8. As noted, however, the respondent was represented by counsel. Further, the respondent has not shown that this alleged error prejudiced the respondent or that she would be eligible for a waiver. See Ikharo v. Holder, 614 F.3d 622, 631 (6th Cir. 2010) (showing of prejudice is essentially a demonstration that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent did not file an application for relief with her motion to reopen or on appeal, or explain what waiver she seeks. Although the respondent references a waiver under section 212(i) of the Act, she states, though counsel, that “[wjhether Respondent would have qualified for a waiver under [section 212(i)] is irrelevant” because its availability was not discussed (respondent’s brief at 8). See 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.23(b)(3) (stating that motions to reopen to apply for relief from the Immigration Judge must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and supporting documents), 1003.2(c)(same for motions to reopen to the Board).

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)] - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cape Verde, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 27, 2011, ordering his removal from the United States. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is subject to removal as an alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude (I.J. at 2). See section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). While the respondent, through counsel, alleges that he was “never told that by pleading to those charges he would be found to be deportable,” it is well established that an alien cannot collaterally attack the legitimacy of a state criminal conviction in a removal proceeding before an Immigration Judge. See Gouveia v. INS, 980 F.2d 814, 817 (1st Cir. 1992) (“Criminal convictions cannot be collaterally attacked during immigration proceedings.”). The Supreme Court’s holding in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), does not change the finality of the respondent’s convictions. See generally Milton v. Holder, 425 F.App’x. 407, 409 (5th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that Padilla did not involve an appeal of an adverse immigration decision, and thus does not indicate that an alien may pursue a Padilla-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings in an effort to collaterally challenge his prior conviction). The respondent does not otherwise raise any issue relating to the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is subject to removal as a result of his criminal convictions. See Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n. 1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to address an issue not raised by a party on appeal).
 
As the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, it is his burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent does not allege that he is presently eligible for any form of relief from removal. A continuance is not a form of relief from removal.
 
*2 We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance. The Immigration Judge appropriately went forward with these proceedings without affording the respondent a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1997); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). At the time of the respondent’s removal hearing, he had valid convictions for immigration purposes. He had not presented any evidence that he had filed motions for post-conviction relief with the appropriate courts. The respondent’s desire to eventually file a motion for post-conviction relief was not, in itself, good cause for a further continuance of his removal proceedings. See generally Jimenez-Guzman v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1294, 1297-99 (10th Cir. 2011). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX6 779 - New York, NY
December 29, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Olu Jaiyebo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 3, 2010, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on August 6, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel and that he did not exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen the proceedings.
 
The respondent states in the motion to reopen that his former attorney, Theophilus Maranga, informed him that his hearing had been scheduled for August 6, 2008. The respondent asserts that he was not able to attend his hearing on that date due to illness. The respondent submitted a doctor’s letter, which states that the respondent was treated on August 4, 2008, for acute bronchitis. The respondent claims that a friend of his delivered the medical note to the attorney’s office prior to the date of the hearing. He indicates that he was not able to contact Mr. Maranga by phone until early 2009, and he did not receive his file until July 2009, due to the transition of Mr. Maranga’s practice to a new law office that had bought his practice. The respondent states that at that time he became aware of the in absentia order of removal. The respondent asserts that as Mr. Maranga had ceased practicing law in the United States and had returned to Ghana, he was not able to inform Mr. Maranga of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has he filed a complaint to the appropriate disciplinary authority regarding such representation. The respondent filed his motion to reopen on November 15, 2010.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that he failed to appear for his hearing due to exceptional circumstances as required by section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). While the letter from the physician indicates a date of service as August 4, 2008, the letter itself is not dated. The respondent explains that the handwritten number on the letter is the doctor’s license number. However, the doctor has not included the name of the state in which he is licensed. Moreover, although the respondent contends that he provided his former attorney with the doctor’s letter prior to his hearing date, Mr. Maranga was present at the hearing and did not mention or submit the letter allegedly provided by the respondent.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124,130 (2d Cir. 2000). However, in order to equitably toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). This includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. Id; see also Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period).
 
*2 The respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent contends that he did not file a complaint with a disciplinary authority because Mr. Maranga left the United States shortly after the respondent was ordered removed. While Mr. Maranga’s departure may have prevented the respondent from informing Mr. Maranga of the allegations leveled against him, it would not have prevented him from filing a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Moreover, the respondent stated in a sworn statement submitted with his motion to reopen that he learned of the in absentia order of removal in July 2009. However, the respondent did not seek reopening until November 2010. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel, nor did the respondent exercise due diligence as required for equitable tolling. See Rashid v. Mukasey, supra. Consequently, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary Ann Romero, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 5, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to our de novo review, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii), we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. On October 27, 2009, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure until February 24, 2010. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b), which sets forth a 90-day deadline to file for reopening, the motion was due on or before January 25, 2010. However, the respondent did not file his motion to reopen until February 24, 2010. On appeal, the respondent argues that because the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) filed an untimely response to his motion, the motion should have been deemed unopposed and granted. We reject this argument. Even if the respondent’s motion was deemed unopposed, the regulations bar reopening.
 
The respondent next argues that the 90-day filing deadline should be equitably tolled because of new evidence that he is eligible for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, based on an approved I-140 petition.1 A request for equitable tolling in this context is in essence a request for sua sponte reopening.2 See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008). However, we decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte because the respondent has identified no exceptional circumstance that would warrant such an extraordinary remedy. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976,984 (BIA 1997) (sua sponte reopening is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). The respondent sought the privilege of pre-conclusion voluntary departure and accordingly waived appeal. However, instead of voluntarily departing on the date required, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen. We do not find that reopening is warranted under such circumstances.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge “abused his discretion” by failing to address whether the voluntary departure period should be tolled for exceptional circumstances. We note that this Board does not review questions of law under an “abuse of discretion” standard of review. Rather, we review questions of law de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

2

We note that the respondent does not allege ineffective assistance of counsel.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brenda M. Villalpando, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Betsy Bailey
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, appeals from an order terminating removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was placed in removal proceedings on May 17, 2011. On August 30, 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requested termination of proceedings as improvidently begun.1 The DHS indicated that it wished to initiate expedited removal proceedings against the respondent as a non-lawful permanent resident alien convicted of an aggravated felony, pursuant to section 238(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b). See Tr. at 17. The Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to expedited removal under section 238(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b) and terminated removal proceedings on August 30, 2011.2 See I.J. at 2.
 
On appeal, the respondent does not dispute either the allegation that he is non-lawful permanent resident alien or that he has been convicted of an aggravated felony.3 Instead, the respondent argues that he will be prejudiced because he will be unable to pursue post-conviction relief under Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).4 However, we note that the respondent has been aware of his drug-trafficking conviction since 2004, this form of relief has been available since March 31, 2010, he was placed in removal proceedings on May 17, 2011, and removal proceedings were terminated on August 30, 2011. Despite this passage of time and the time that this appeal has been pending, there is no evidence submitted on appeal that the respondent’s conviction has been vacated pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky.
 
*2 We note, moreover, that such a post-conviction motion does not render the respondent’s conviction non-final. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). See also Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 216-17 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1985); Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-93 (2d Cir. 1976).
 
Consequently, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the DHS’s request to terminate removal proceedings so that it could pursue expedited removal of the respondent under section 238(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b). Cf. U.S. v. Hernandez-Vermudez, 356 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 2004); Alcala v. Holder, 563 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir. 2009).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Government officers authorized to issue a Notice to Appear are also authorized to cancel them as improvidently begun. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.2(6). After proceedings have commenced, an authorized officer or government counsel can move the Immigration Judge to dismiss the matter on the grounds that it was improvidently begun. Such dismissal shall be without prejudice to the government or the alien. See 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(c).

2

8 C.F.R. § 1238.1 (e) provides: “In any proceeding commenced under section 240 of the Act which is based under section 237 of the Act, if it appears that the respondent alien is subject to removal pursuant to section 238 of the Act, the Immigration Judge may, upon the Service’s request, terminate the case, and upon such termination, the Service may commence administrative proceedings under section 238 of the Act. However, in the absence of any such request, the Immigration Judge shall complete the proceeding commenced under section 240 of the Act.”

The Notice to Appear alleges that, on May 20, 2004, the respondent was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana.

4

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in his deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates his right to counsel.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alison M. Brown, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on May 29, 2009, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to “prepare a new decision,” given that the name on the decision referred to a different alien, and the decision referred to forms of relief for which the respondent did not apply. On remand, the Immigration Judge amended his decision to correct the errors. The respondent has appealed. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has opposed the appeal. The record will be remanded once again to the Immigration Judge.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met their burdens of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On remand before the Immigration Judge, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, along with evidence of his compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge declined to adjudicate the motion, finding that consideration of the motion would exceed the scope of the remand. We disagree.
 
As a general rule, when we remand a case to an Immigration Judge, the remand is effective for the stated purpose and for consideration of other appropriate matters, unless the Board qualifies or limits the remand for a specific purpose. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600, 601 (BIA 1978). Although we remanded the matter for a specific purpose, the situation here is akin to that which we considered in Matter of M-D-, 24 I&N Dec. 138 (BIA 2007). In that case, we held that when a case is remanded for the specific and limited purpose of conducting background checks, the Immigration Judge reacquires jurisdiction over the proceedings and may consider additional evidence if it is material, was not previously available, and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Id. at 141-42, see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1) and 1003.23(b)(3).
 
Thus, the Immigration Judge in the instant case reacquired jurisdiction over the proceedings on remand and had the authority to consider the respondent’s motion to reopen.1 Therefore, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence presented by the respondent and to adjudicate the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 17, 2011, ordering his removal from the United States. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). While the respondent references unpublished decisions from this Board in his appeal brief, such decisions are not binding precedent. See Matter of Echeverria, 25 I&N Dec. 512, 519 (BIA 2011).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is subject to removal as an alien who at any time after admission has been convicted under any law of purchasing, selling, offering for sale, exchanging, using, owning, possessing, or carrying, or of attempting or conspiring to purchase, sell, offer for sale, exchange, use, own, possess, or carry, any weapon, part, or accessory which is a firearm or destructive device (I.J. at 3).2 Section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C). Pending post-conviction motions or other collateral attacks do not negate the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes unless and until the conviction is overturned. Jimenez-Guzman v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1294, 1297 (10th Cir. 2011). Moreover, it is well established that an alien cannot collaterally attack the legitimacy of a state criminal conviction in a removal proceeding before an Immigration Judge. Waugh v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1279, 1282 (10th Cir. 2011). The Supreme Court’s holding in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), does not change the finality of the respondent’s conviction for immigration purposes. See generally Milton v. Holder, 425 F.App’x. 407, 409 (5th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that Padilla did not involve an appeal of an adverse immigration decision, and thus does not indicate that an alien may pursue a Padilla-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings in an effort to collaterally challenge his prior conviction). The respondent’s conviction for aggravated assault in that he displayed a firearm in a manner creating a substantial risk of death or injury to another serves as a valid basis upon which a finding of removability can be made for immigration purposes until it is overturned or modified by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). Accordingly, the respondent is properly found to be removable on this basis.
 
*2 As the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, it is his burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). In his appeal brief, the respondent does not allege that he is presently eligible for any form of relief from removal. A continuance is not a form of relief from removal.
 
The Immigration Judge appropriately went forward with these proceedings without affording the respondent a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1997); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). At the time of the respondent’s removal hearing, he had a valid conviction for immigration purposes and the respondent had not filed a motion for post-conviction relief with the pertinent state court (I.J. at 7). The respondent’s desire to eventually file a motion for post-conviction relief was not, in itself, “good cause” for a further continuance of his removal proceedings. See Jimenez-Guzman v. Holder, supra, at 1297-99. To the extent that the request for a request for a continuance to seek post-conviction relief is similar to a request for a continuance to await adjudication of an immigrant visa petition, the alien described in Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009), was the beneficiary of a pending immigrant visa petition at the time that he sought a continuance. However, the respondent in this case had not commenced his pursuit of post-conviction relief with the pertinent state court at the time that his request for a continuance was denied. Inasmuch as the mere possibility that an immigrant visa petition would be filed on an alien’s behalf is insufficient to warrant a continuance of proceedings, the mere possibility that an alien will file a motion for post-conviction relief is also insufficient to warrant a continuance. See Luevano v. Holder, 660 F.3d 1207, 1215 (10th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that there is no agency or court precedent for requiring an Immigration Judge to grant an indefinite continuance so that an alien may remain in this country while awaiting eligibility for adjustment of status).
 
With his appeal brief, the respondent has presented a copy of a document entitled “State’s Response to Petitioner’s Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis.”3 However, the Board does not consider new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting the Board’s fact finding authority; see also Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 and n. 10 (BIA 1984). To the extent that the request to consider this document constitutes a motion to remand, the document does not warrant a remand for further proceedings because the evidence would not alter the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). As stated above, the respondent’s conviction remains valid for immigration purposes until it is overturned or modified. The mere filing of a motion for post-conviction relief does not affect the respondent’s removability or the outcome of this case. Likewise, the mere filing of a motion for post-conviction relief does warrant an indefinite continuance of removal proceedings. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma where the case was docketed for hearing (see OPPM No. 04-06) and where the hearing notice directed the respondent to appear via video teleconference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A) (iii) of the Act. The Immigration Judge conducted the hearing there remotely from Dallas, Texas.

According to the document, the respondent filed a motion for post-conviction relief on November 14, 2011. However, the respondent has not presented a copy of his motion to this Board.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jerome D. Lee, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jill K. Jensen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Korea, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 25, 2010, finding the respondent’s application abandoned, but granting voluntary departure. The respondent has also moved for a remand. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied, but the record will be remanded for further proceedings concerning the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure.
 
In her decision, the Immigration Judge explained that, since the respondent had not filed the necessary evidence to establish her prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status by the January 4, 2010, deadline set by order issued at the prior hearing of June 18, 2009, the respondent had abandoned her application for relief. See I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 4.1 The Immigration Judge acknowledged the respondent’s argument that the untimely filing was solely the fault of her prior attorney, but found that not to be a valid reason to warrant a further continuance. Id. On appeal, the respondent reiterates her allegations that her untimely filing was her prior attorney’s fault and that she received ineffective assistance from that prior counsel, and asks that her case be remanded to allow the Immigration Judge to evaluate the evidence that she has submitted to establish prima facie eligibility.
 
In order to establish ineffective assistance of prior counsel, an alien must establish that his or her counsel’s performance was so deficient that it impinged the ‘fundamental fairness’ of the hearing and caused prejudice, which exists when the performance was so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. See Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2011), citing Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999); see also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-4 (11th Cir.2005).
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), we held that claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel require (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of the counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. The Eleventh Circuit has determined that the Board may require aliens to satisfy the three-part Lozada test. See Gbaya v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir.2003).
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a further continuance on the basis of abandonment. We have held that the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Here, the respondent attributed to her prior attorney her untimely filing of the necessary evidence, but did not demonstrate compliance with any of the three Lozada requirements. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination not to accept the untimely-filed evidence. We also agree that, given these circumstances, the Immigration Judge could find that the respondent had not shown to be prima facie eligible for adjustment of status and had not shown good cause to warrant a further delay in the proceedings. See generally Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785-789 (BIA 2009) (citing apparent statutory eligibility for adjustment as one of the factors to weigh in determining whether good cause exists for granting a continuance).
 
On appeal, the respondent has submitted an affidavit in which she reiterates her testimony that the delay in submitting the evidence required in the June 18, 2009, written order was solely the fault of her prior attorney. The respondent, however, has not submitted evidence that she has informed her prior attorney of her allegations against him (other than claiming, without actual proof, that her prior attorney “candidly admitted what had happened”) and that she has given him an opportunity to respond. She has also specifically stated in her affidavit that she has not yet filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities against that attorney. Therefore, since the respondent has not yet shown substantial compliance with the Lozada criteria, we are unpersuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision and find no reason to grant a remand.
 
At the conclusion of the respondent’s last hearing, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure in the amount of 60 days, with no bond set, and specifically advised the respondent that she had the right to file an appeal. See I.J. at 10-11. However, the Immigration Judge completed a form indicating that the respondent was being granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure, which requires knowing and voluntary waiver of an alien’s appeal rights. See section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b). If the Immigration Judge intended to grant post-conclusion voluntary departure, the respondent should have been required to show that she meets the four requirements set forth in the Act for granting such relief, which includes posting a minimum bond of $500. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c). Under these circumstances, we will return the record to the Immigration Judge to clarify which form of voluntary departure she intended to grant the respondent and to determine whether the respondent meets all of the corresponding requirements for the form of voluntary departure granted. A new decision shall thereafter be entered and the appropriate voluntary departure warnings provided. See Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: With respect to the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure, the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

Specifically, the written order issued by the Immigration Judge on June 18, 2009, advised the respondent that she must file documentation to establish the bona fides of her marriage by January 4, 2010. It also warned her that failure to do so “will be viewed as an abandonment of the relief sought.” See Exh. 4; see also Tr. at 3-4.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dalbir Singh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jose Rivera
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision mailed on December 23, 2010, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia and in a decision mailed on October 26, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reconsider is time-barred. In this case the respondent’s motion to reconsider was initially received on November 26, 2010, but was rejected since the required filing fee was incorrectly submitted to the Immigration Court. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.24(a) (stating that the Immigration Court does not collect fees). Thereafter, the motion to reconsider was filed on December 3, 2010, more than 30 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the principles for reconsideration). The respondent argues for the first time on appeal that the delay was due to an error at her attorney’s office. Even if equitable tolling is taken into consideration, her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy any of the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). We therefore find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion to reconsider was untimely.
 
The respondent has submitted evidence on appeal including documentation that was submitted with her motion to reconsider. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). To the extent that the submission of evidence could be construed as a motion to reopen the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reconsider, such a motion is numerically-barred. Absent certain exceptions, an alien is permitted to file only one motion to reopen and one motion to reconsider.2 See sections 240(c)(6)(A), (7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A), (7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). See generally Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000) (holding that a motion to remand submitted during the pendency of an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of an untimely motion to reopen and filed after the entry of a final administrative decision is not excepted from the numerical restriction that permits the filing of only one motion to reopen). The respondent has already filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge and then filed an untimely motion to reconsider. We therefore find that a remand is not warranted because it is number barred.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

There is no evidence in the record that the respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2010, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s claim that she failed to appear for her December 19, 2000, hearing due to lack of notice. The Immigration Judge found that notice was proper since the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear and since she subsequently appeared at the San Juan Immigration Court on July 13, 2000, and was provided with notice of her hearing. See Exhs. 1, 3(a), 3(b). We note that the record also reflects that on July 10, 2000, the San Juan Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing to the respondent at her last known address which was not returned to the court. See Exhs. 3, 2.

The evidence presented does not raise an exception to the time and number limitations governing motions to reopen. See, e.g., sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv) of the Act.

IN RE: JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ-GONZALEZ A.K.A. MIGUEL GAMORA MORALES A.K.A. JOSE MORA GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX7 536 - Los Angeles, California
December 14, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret Reyes, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s September 22, 2011, decision, finding him removable as charged, based on his admissions (Tr. at 2); and ordering his removal. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clear erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Removability is not at issue and the gravamen of the respondent’s appeal is a denial of due process claim premised on allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Even assuming arguendo, that the affidavit of the respondent accompanying the appellate brief would satisfy the first requirement, the second of those criteria is that “before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond.” Id. (emphasis added). We observed that this requirement exists to provide attorneys “whose integrity or competence is being impugned, [the opportunity] to present [their] version of events,” if they choose to do so, and serves to discourage baseless allegations. Id. The respondent has provided no evidence that he has informed his former counsel of the allegations against him and allowed him the opportunity to timely respond. The respondent has failed to comply with this critical Lozada requirement. Furthermore, the respondent has submitted no evidence that he filed a complaint with the California State Bar concerning his former counsel’s performance, or explained his failure to do so.
 
*2 We acknowledge that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has stated that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent argues that full compliance is not required here where the ineffective assistance is “plain on its face.” See e.g., Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffectiveness was plain on its face where former counsel mis-calendared the removal hearing, petitioner failed to appear at the hearing, and declarations were filed that complied with the first two prongs of Lozada); and Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffectiveness was plain on its face where former counsel forgot to file the brief because he was transitioning to a new job and taking over a former colleague’s caseload, and declarations were filed satisfying the first prong of Lozada). However, on de novo review, we find that the alleged ineffective assistance here, is not “plain on its face,” where respondent’s former counsel obtained several continuances to “explore possible relief [from removal]” (Tr. at 3, 6-7, 10-11) (emphasis added). See Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010) (finding the ineffectiveness of alien’s former counsel’s assistance is not plain on its face). Aside from the respondent’s challenge on appeal that he did not really intend to forgo a request for voluntary departure,1 the respondent has not identified any other forms of relief from removal that his former counsel failed to request, as they had agreed.
 
The court acknowledges that “[t]he goal of Lozada was to provide a more objective basis from which to assess the veracity of the substantial number of ineffective assistance claims … and to hold attorneys to appropriate standards of performance,” and “[w]here these goals are furthered, courts have unanimously upheld the requirements set forth in Lozada.” See Id. Thus, notice to the attorney whose actions are being challenged, with sufficient time to respond, is a central element in this Board’s capacity to adjudicate “ineffective assistance of counsel” claims. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that notification to former counsel is not only “required” for an ineffective assistance claim, but also that former counsel must be afforded an adequate “opportunity to respond” before the aggrieved respondent filed his motion to reopen with the Board). Consequently, as the respondent has not complied with this critical procedural requirement, he has not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 Nonetheless, even assuming arguendo that he had demonstrated substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements, the respondent still has not shown that a remand for further proceedings is warranted, as he has not shown “prejudice.” See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (Board held that satisfying the Lozada procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen, and that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel). In order to establish a valid due process claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must demonstrate that his former attorney’s deficient performance was prejudicial. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 903 (9th Cir. 2003) (concluding that an attorney’s “flawed” performance did not provide a basis for a due process claim because the alien could not “demonstrate that counsel’s alleged malfeasance prejudiced his claim for relief.”)); Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 527 (“Due process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice to succeed.”). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
However, the court has found that even where former counsel’s performance was inadequate but the alien still had an opportunity to present his claim, “[p]rejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Ray v. Gonzales, supra, at 587 (quoting Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that “to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show both error and prejudice”). In this regard, the court has held that the alien may not benefit from the presumption of prejudice, if he fails to provide “plausible grounds for relief.” See Siong v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 376 F.3d 1030, 1037 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
In the matter before us, however, the respondent neither challenges the Immigration Judge’s findings as to his removability, nor does he identify a plausible basis for any relief or protection from removal that his former counsel failed to request, as agreed. “Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). The respondent has not met that burden. The record reflects that the respondent was afforded a full and fair hearing.
 
*4 Consequently, as the respondent has not demonstrated compliance with the Lozada procedural requirements, or any resultant prejudice from his former attorney’s alleged deficient representation, that affected the outcome of these proceedings, the respondent has not established that he suffered a denial of due process based on his claims of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and has not shown that a remand for further proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note, parenthetically, that the record reflects that the respondent did not speak up and contradict the statement by his former counsel at the September 22, 2011, hearing, in response to the query posed by the Immigration Judge, that after having fully discussed the issue with him, the respondent did not wish to pursue voluntary departure (Tr. at 14). Furthermore, the respondent, on appeal, has not presented any evidence that he was either statutorily qualified for voluntary departure, or that he warranted a grant of said relief, as a matter of discretion. See Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999); Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Surajudeen Agbaje, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 27, 2010. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen pursuant to Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4) (2011). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on July 8, 2009, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). The respondent filed a motion to reopen the record of proceeding and to rescind the in absentia removal order on December 31, 2009 (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). The respondent explained in the motion to reopen that she failed to appear on July 8, 2009, because her attorney erroneously informed her that the date for the hearing was July 9, 2009 (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)).
 
The Immigration Judge observed that the explanation constituted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 801-02 (5th Cir. 2007); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937-38 (9th Cir. 2003); Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54, 59 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005)) (“We now join our sister circuits in concluding that, under BIA precedent applicable to the pre-1996 version of the INA as well as its current iteration, a lawyer’s inaccurate advice to his client concerning an immigration hearing date can constitute ‘exceptional circumstances’ excusing the alien’s failure to appear at a deportation hearing [] and meriting the reopening of an in absentia deportation order [].”). However, the respondent did not support this claim with any evidence, such as an affidavit, or otherwise comply with the customary requirements for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). See also Zheng v. United States Dept. Of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005). Furthermore, the respondent provided no explanation for the delay between the entry of the in absentia order and the filing of the motion to reopen (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). Hence, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)).
 
*2 On March 30, 2010, the respondent moved for reconsideration, and the Department of Homeland Security opposed the motion on April 8, 2010 (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). The respondent supported the motion for reconsideration with an affidavit in which she corroborated the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in the underlying motion to reopen. However, the respondent, who was (and continues to be) represented by the attorney against whom the claim of ineffectiveness has been made, did not otherwise attempt to comply with the standards set out in Matter of Lozada, supra (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for reconsideration, and this appeal ensued.
 
In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent contends that her failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, is “not a fatal error.” We disagree. First, the respondent is appealing from the denial of the motion for reconsideration, not from the denial of the underlying motion to reopen. Motions for reconsideration constitute a request to reassess the evidence already in the record of proceeding, not a request for consideration of new, previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006) (“A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence.” (citations omitted)).
 
Second, the respondent is incorrect in dismissing the importance of the substantive and procedural requirements for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. For example, the bar complaint requirement plays an important role in deterring meritless claims and policing the private immigration bar. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996) (recognizing that “for attorneys who may practice before us simply by virtue of their admission into a state bar or the bar of another recognized jurisdiction, we rely on the disciplinary process of the relevant jurisdiction’s bar as the first, and ordinarily the fastest, means of identifying and correcting possible misconduct.”); see also Aris v.

*3 Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, which we treat as a request for remand, the motion is both time-barred, as it was filed on September 29, 2010, which is more than 90-days after the entry of the in absentia order of removal on July 8, 2009, and number-barred, as the respondent has already filed one motion to reopen and one motion for reconsideration. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 2000) (“Because the Immigration Judge entered a final administrative decision and declined to disturb the decision’s finality, the respondent’s motion to remand must be subject to the time and number limits for motions to reopen; otherwise, we will have allowed the respondent to circumvent the regulatory limits set forth in 8 C.F.R. § [100]3.2.”); see also Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 858, 874 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). And, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent is not presently eligible for adjustment of status, as there is no immigrant visa immediately available to her (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). See Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009) (“A visa is immediately available when the alien’s priority date is earlier than the date for the specified preference category shown on the current Visa Bulletin.” (citations omitted)); see also Osorio v. Mayorkas, 656 F.3d 954, 956-57 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anne McElearney
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On September 7, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance and found that he had not established ineffective assistance of his former counsel, who sought only voluntary departure before the Immigration Judge and did not pursue applications for cancellation of removal and asylum. Although the Immigration Judge granted a period of voluntary departure, voluntary departure was not reinstated by the Board because the respondent did not submit proof of having timely paid the bond. See BIA 9/7/11 at 2-3. The respondent has filed a timely motion for reconsideration of the September 7, 2011, decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent has cited no statutes, regulations, or precedent decisions in support of the allegations of error contained in his motion for reconsideration.
 
Subsequent to the Board’s decision, the respondent filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26, when an alien files a petition for review, any grant of voluntary departure automatically terminates. Consequently, even had the Board reinstated a period of voluntary departure, that grant of voluntary departure would no longer be in effect. Under the circumstances, there is no basis for granting a motion to reconsider in order to grant voluntary departure at this time.
 
Next, in support of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel made on appeal, the respondent presented a letter signed by Daniel Marc Roland Cortier, an individual who is not a licensed attorney or an accredited representative and who has been ordered by Disciplinary Counsel for the Executive Office for Immigration Review to cease and desist representing aliens before Immigration Courts and the Board. See BIA 9/7/11 at 2, n. 1. There was no showing that this letter was ever mailed. The Board did not err in finding that this letter prepared by an individual who has no authority to represent the respondent in immigration proceedings is insufficient to show substantial compliance with the threshold requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board also did not err in finding that the respondent had not shown he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance where his allegations on appeal setting forth the ineffective assistance claim were inconsistent with his testimony below. Notwithstanding the respondent’s disagreement with our decision and our evaluation of the evidence, we find no legal or factual defect in our September 7, 2011, decision. Consequently, reconsideration is not warranted.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Isuf Kola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ellen J. Krupp
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 8, 2009. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction. The respondent requested, but was denied, a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent entered the United States on March 1, 1994, without being admitted or paroled into the United States. On October 4, 2000, the respondent was convicted of Unlawful Possession of a Controlled Substance, in violation of Illinois law. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exh. 2. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction. See Tr. at 22. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). The respondent conceded removability for being present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled in, and for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation. See Tr. at 22.
 
At the October 8, 2009, hearing, the respondent requested a continuance to collaterally attack the convictions pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S._, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010),1 but the Immigration Judge denied that request. See I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 22.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The respondent alleges that he filed a motion to vacate his conviction. However, there is no evidence that the conviction has been vacated.
 
*2 An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).2 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in his deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates his right to counsel.

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
John D. Shin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 In a November 13, 2009, decision, this Board dismissed the respondents’ appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of their request to continue proceedings.1 On August 20, 2010, and again on July 6, 2011, we denied the respondents’ motions to reopen. The respondents, who are natives and citizens of South Korea, have continued to press for additional time so that one of them might obtain an approved employment-based visa petition. They have now moved that we reconsider our last decision. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify the errors of fact or law in the previous order and shall be supported with pertinent authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondents offer no direct challenge with the finding in our previous decision that their last motion to reopen was numerically barred and untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (only one motion to reopen maybe filed, and it must be filed within a 90-day deadline). They continue to assert, however, that alleged ineffective assistance of counsel-which might toll such limitations on the filing a motion to reopen-caused the visa petition submitted on behalf of one of the co-respondents to be revoked. We previously considered and rejected this argument. We noted in our last decision that the respondents had not met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to file such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and had not shown that they were prejudiced by that former attorney’s conduct.
 
The prior attorney, Steven Y. Lee, was reportedly handling the visa petition filed by Sun Ok Hwang’s now-former employer on her behalf. We emphasize that the respondents have no standing to challenge the attorney’s work for that employer-client, whether involving a potential appeal or otherwise, as they could not retain the attorney themselves to secure the visa petition. Further, the respondents previously asserted that the attorney’s fraud conviction and disbarment related to other matters, and they submitted an affidavit from that attorney stating that the co-respondent’s visa petition was not tainted by any fraud. In so doing, they undercut their own claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of their relationship with this attorney (which they have not sufficiently specified) with respect to, perhaps, the filing of their adjustment of status application. As the respondents acknowledge, in light of the allegations of fraud surrounding that attorney in other matters, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) provided the co-respondent’s former employer with an opportunity to prove the validity of the visa petition. It is undisputed that the employer chose not to do so, and that the visa petition was revoked in 2005, well before the Immigration Judge’s 2008 decision to deny a continuance. Thus, the respondents were not prejudiced by the former attorney’s actions, whatever agreement they may have had with him, as the employer decided not to pursue the visa petition. The respondents set forth no sufficient evidence of an agreement with the attorney which might show where he failed in any obligation to them.
 
*2 The respondent’s last motion to reopen provided no evidence that the respondents were any further along in their attempts for one or more of them to obtain an employment-based visa petition after the previous one was revoked over half a decade ago. As noted, that motion was numerically barred and untimely. Although another such visa petition had apparently been filed in 2009 on behalf of the lead respondent, it was conceded that that petition had been denied.2 Without a pending labor certification or pending visa petition, where the final order of removal had been entered in this case over 2 years ago, and where such evidence is provided after the numerical and time limitations for filing a motion to reopen, the respondents’ last motion did not provide a basis for reopening proceedings. See Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); see also Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). As they have not identified a factual or legal error with the prior decision, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

The respondents previously provided evidence that one or more employers may have been considering over the years whether to pursue additional visa petition(s), and asserted through counsel that DHS’s online database (incorrectly) reflected that the former visa petition was still pending. None of this, or any other evidence submitted, overcame the time and numerical bars to their last motion to reopen.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(K), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(K)]

APPLICATION: Reconsideration, reopening
 
This case was last before us on September 6, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. On October 5, 2011, the respondent filed what he titled a motion to reconsider. To the extent that the respondent’s motion is a motion to reconsider, it is timely. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2) (stating that a motion to reconsider “must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision”). To the extent that the respondent’s motion is a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the motion also is timely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act (stating that motions to reopen “shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal”). The respondent’s motion, however, will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal also will be denied.
  
I. MOTION TO RECONSIDER
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of South Korea. In his motion, he argues that we erred in upholding the Immigration Judge’s finding that his conviction for conspiracy to use an interstate facility in aiding a racketeering enterprise constituted a conviction for an aggravated felony. The respondent contends that his offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(K)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(K)(i), because he could not have been convicted of owning, controlling, managing or supervising a prostitution business. The respondent maintains that the evidence shows that he was merely an employee who followed orders and that he did not own, control or supervise a prostitution business.1
 
The respondent also contends that the offense for which he was convicted is not categorically an aggravated felony, and he appears to claim that the modified categorical approach is not appropriate given the structure of the statute. See Respondent’s Motion for Reconsideration at 4. The respondent then goes on to contend that, if the modified categorical approach is applied, the examination of the record of conviction should include consideration of the variations in the sentences imposed on the three defendants in the criminal proceeding. The respondent claims that the difference in the sentences shows that the defendants had different levels of participation in the crime and that he had the smallest role. In addition, the respondent claims that his acquittal on the money laundering charge in his criminal case should be considered, and he maintains that this Board overlooked this fact in reviewing his case.
 
*2 We do not find that the respondent has identified any errors of law or fact in our prior ruling in his case. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006). The respondent raised his claim that his offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(K)(i) of the Act in his brief on appeal, and we previously addressed this argument. We find no error in our prior conclusion that the record of conviction sufficiently supports a finding that the respondent is removable as charged. While the respondent maintains that the evidence shows that he was simply an employee rather than an owner or manager of a prostitution business, the issue in this proceeding is not what the evidence at his criminal trial showed but for what offense he was convicted. As we stated previously, the information in the superseding indictment and the judgement is sufficient to establish that he was convicted of conspiracy to commit acts that involved managing or supervising a prostitution business rather than simply conspiracy to commit acts involving the promotion of a prostitution business. Accordingly, we find no basis for reconsidering our prior decision upholding the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as charged.
 
In addition, we did not err in applying the modified categorical approach in analyzing the respondent’s offense. Unlike the statute at issue in Familia Rosario v. Holder, 655 F.3d 93 (7th Cir. 2011), a recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in a case involving the same portion of the aggravated felony definition, the statute at issue in the respondent’s case, 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3), is divisible. Cf. Smalley v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 332, 336 (5th Cir. 2003) (finding 18 U.S.C. § 1952 to be divisible in the context of a determination as to whether a conviction under the statute qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude). Section 1952(a)(3) of Title 18 of the United States Code contains a list of disjunctive elements, some of which would make the offense an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(K)(i) of the Act and some of which would not. Accordingly, neither we nor the Immigration Judge erred in looking to the record of conviction in the respondent’s case to determine under which portion of the statute the respondent was convicted. See Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 456, 463-64 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
Moreover, the fact that the respondent was acquitted of the money laundering charge contained in count 2 of the superseding indictment in his criminal case has no bearing on whether his conviction for the offense described in count 1 of that indictment constitutes a conviction for an aggravated felony. We therefore find no error in our failure to mention the respondent’s acquittal on the other charge.
 
*3 Similarly, the fact that the other defendants in the respondent’s criminal trial received different sentences is not relevant to the determination as to whether the respondent was convicted of a crime that constitutes an aggravated felony. See Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra, at 463-4 and 468-9 (listing the limited set of documents that can be considered in applying the modified categorical approach and finding that this Board erred in considering sentencing factors or information, which does not simply define the charge and the defendant’s guilty plea, but, instead, frequently refers to facts neither alleged nor admitted in court). We therefore could not, and cannot, consider this information in determining whether the respondent is removable as charged, despite the respondent’s claims.
 
Based on the foregoing, we do not find any basis for reconsidering our prior decision upholding the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as charged. We therefore deny the respondent’s motion to the extent that the motion is a motion to reconsider.
  
II. MOTION TO REOPEN
 
In addition to his allegations regarding our ruling on his removability, the respondent claims in his motion that the time the Immigration Judge gave him to explore possible relief from removal was insufficient given the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys. The respondent argues that his former attorneys failed to interview him sufficiently to determine whether he was eligible for any form of relief and failed to research the issue sufficiently. The respondent claims that he was prejudiced by these errors because he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status.2
 
To the extent that he is making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s motion constitutes a motion to reopen. The respondent, however, has not satisfied the procedural requirements that must be met before he may obtain reopening on the basis of such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In particular, the respondent has not submitted evidence to establish that he has notified his former attorneys of the allegations he is making against them, and he has not offered evidence to show that he has filed a complaint with the relevant disciplinary authorities regarding the conduct of his former attorneys. The respondent therefore has not met his burden of establishing that he is entitled to reopening for further proceedings due to the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any possible errors committed by his former attorneys. See Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent claims that he was and is eligible for relief from removal, but the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under sections 240A(a) and (b)(1) of the Act due to his criminal conviction. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3) (indicating that an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is ineligible for relief); section 240A(b)(1)(B) and (C) of the Act (same). In addition, the respondent has not established that he is admissible to the United States for permanent residence as required by section 245(a) of the Act. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a); section 212(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2). The respondent claims he is eligible for a waiver of any criminal ground of inadmissibility, but he is statutorily barred from obtaining a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act due to the fact that he has been convicted of an aggravated felony since his admission to the United States as a lawful permanent resident.3 See section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).
 
*4 Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the respondent has met his burden of establishing that he is entitled to reopening for further proceedings. We therefore deny his motion to the extent that it is a motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is denied.

The respondent also argues that his offense does not constitute an aggravated felony as defined in sections 101(a)(43)(K)(ii) and (iii) of the Act, but neither we nor the Immigration Judge made findings to this effect. We therefore need not address the respondent’s arguments on these points.

2

The respondent also has reiterated some of the arguments he made on appeal regarding the manner in which the Immigration Judge conducted his proceedings. The respondent, however, has not pointed to any factual or legal errors in our prior determination that his arguments on this subject were not supported by the record. We therefore find it unnecessary to reconsider the respondent’s claims. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra.

3

The respondent argues that his former attorneys erred in believing that his admission to the United States as an immigrant made him ineligible for adjustment of status because he now is the beneficiary of a new, approved visa petition. The respondent, however, has misunderstood the reason his initial entry became an issue in his proceedings below. The issue was not whether the respondent was eligible to adjust his status based on the initial visa petition but whether he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. If the respondent had adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident rather than entering the United States as an immigrant, he could have qualified for a waiver of inadmissibility under Martinez v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 532 (5th Cir. 2008) and could have been prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. The respondent, however, entered the United States as an immigrant. He therefore does not qualify for the exception to the aggravated felony bar to section 212(h) relief carved out by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Martinez v. Mukasey, supra, and cannot obtain a waiver of any possible grounds of inadmissibility.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christi M. Gelo, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on August 25, 2010, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 8, 2008, decision to deny his application for adjustment of status. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen on October 21, 2011. A motion to reopen a case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.1
 
The respondent has also not demonstrated an “exceptional situation” that would warrant reopening the proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See generally Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(“the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). The respondent argues that his prior attorney failed to properly file an appeal from this Board’s August 25, 2010, decision, and he has submitted various court documents to illustrate the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he suffered. We do not find this argument and these documents, standing alone, persuasive to support reopening. The respondent states only that he would have received a stay of removal if his prior attorney had properly appealed our decision, but this supposition does not persuade us that the evidence he has submitted would alter the result of our prior decision. Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb that decision, and the respondent’s motion will be denied as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The record indicates that the respondent has been removed. Given the respondent’s removal, the Board would not generally consider the motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d); Zhang v. Holder, 617 F.3d 650 (2d Cir. 2010); Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008). However, in Luna v. Holder, 637 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2011), the Court held that the Board must exercise its full jurisdiction to adjudicate a statutory motion to reopen by an alien who is removed or otherwise departs the United States before or after filing the motion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nancy Denis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Atkins White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 3, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to find that the respondent demonstrated exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. The Department of Homeland Security has moved for summary affirmance. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find that the respondent has demonstrated that exceptional circumstances prevented her from attending her hearing. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). The record reflects that the respondent has substantially complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and her motion to reopen was filed within 180 days of the entry of the in absentia order of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The affidavit submitted by the respondent’s counsel of record provides that she informed the respondent in early June 2010 that her hearing had been reset and that she would be receiving a new notice in the mail (Attachment to Respondent’s Brief at 17-18). The attorney acknowledged that she confused the respondent’s case with another client’s case, and, upon receiving the Immigration Court’s in absentia order regarding the respondent, she persuaded the respondent to allow her to correct the error in lieu of filing a complaint with the State Bar. See id; Matter of Grijalva, supra.
 
*2 Inasmuch as the record reflects that the respondent was misinformed by her counsel that she did not need to appear for her June 22, 2010, hearing, and considering the totality of the circumstances, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with a hearing regarding the respondent’s removability from the United States and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

November 23, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed at a hearing before the Immigration Judge on May 21, 2009. On September 16, 2009, he submitted a Notice of Appeal. On November 30, 2009, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely. On December 17, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. On March 2, 2010, the Board denied the motion to reconsider. On July 27, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied. The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3).
 
In our November 30, 2009, decision dismissing the respondent’s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction, we noted that a party wishing to file a motion to reconsider, challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, must file the motion with the Board. However, we noted that a party challenging any other finding or seeking to reopen the case must file the motion with the Immigration Court. Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). We also noted that time and number limitations exist for motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In his December 17, 2009, motion to reconsider, the respondent argued that the Board erred in its November 30, 2009, decision in not addressing his claim that his former attorney agreed to file an appeal but failed to do so. In our March 2, 2010, decision, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider, finding that the respondent failed to explain why the untimely appeal was submitted almost 3 months past the due date for appeal, and that the respondent has not shown due diligence. See, e.g., Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417, 423 (6th Cir. 2007); Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir. 2003). We also noted that the respondent failed to show his compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), including that the former attorney be notified of the charges against him and that a disciplinary complaint be filed. See also Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
In the current motion to reopen, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel of the former attorney, and also argues that the 90-day motion to reopen time limitations should be tolled in his case. In support of the motion, the respondent submitted documents showing that the former attorney has been suspended from practice of law in Tennessee and before the Board, the Immigration Courts, and the DHS. The respondent also submitted a copy of his complaint against the former attorney addressed to the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility, dated June 22, 2009.
 
*2 As we noted in our November 30, 2009, decision, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, thus a motion to reopen proceedings must be filed with the Immigration Court, and the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of Mladineo, supra; Matter of Lopez, supra. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
We also note that the respondent’s motion to reopen essentially reiterates the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the former attorney raised in his prior motion to reconsider. Thus, the respondent’s motion could be considered in substance a second motion to reconsider, or in the alternative a motion to reconsider our denial of his previous motion to reconsider. While the Board may have jurisdiction to consider such a motion, an alien may file only one motion to reconsider, and the regulation provides that a party may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. Section 240(c)(6)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will also be denied as a motion to reconsider.1
 
Finally, the respondent urges that the Board should accept his appeal by certification. In our March 2, 2010, decision, the Board declined to consider this matter on certification. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s motion that certification is warranted in this case. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Even if we were to consider the arguments made in the respondent’s motion, we would not find that reopening or reconsideration is warranted. While the respondent submitted a copy of his complaint against the former attorney addressed to the Board of Professional Responsibility, dated June 22, 2009, which bears the stamp “FILE COPY,” the respondent submitted no evidence that this complaint was actually filed on June 22, 2009. If and to the extent that this complaint was filed on June 22, 2009, the same day his Notice of Appeal was due, the respondent has not explained or shown why he did not submit his Notice of Appeal with the Board until September 16, 2009, or explained why he did not submit this document during his appeal or in his previous motion to reconsider.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mike Sethi, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated November 12, 2010, denying her motion to reopen proceedings held under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed an opposition to the appeal, which will be sustained.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on June 23, 2006, after failing to appear for her hearing that day. The respondent thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal with the Board, which returned the record to the Immigration Judge on April 16, 2007, for consideration and adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reopen. On August 2, 2010, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Court, asserting that she failed to attend her hearing because she had mechanical problems with her car on the day of the hearing, and that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1
 
On November 15, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for two reasons. First, she found that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances because counsel’s assertions that the respondent’s car suffered mechanical failure was not supported by an affidavit, the repair receipt submitted was silent as to what time of day the respondent sought the mechanic’s services, and there was no evidence the respondent attempted to contact the court regarding the delay (I.J. at 3). Second, the Immigration Judge held that the respondent did not meet the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), because the respondent did not provide an affidavit explaining the scope the Mr. Bonilla’s representation, and did not demonstrate how she was prejudiced by his representation (Id.).
 
The Immigration Judge committed clear error in finding that “[t]here is no affidavit from Respondent” (I.J. at 3). Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s findings, the respondent’s August 2, 2010, motion was accompanied by an affidavit in which she attested, among other things, that her “car broke down on the way to court, in the middle of the freeway” (Affidavit dated June 26, 2010, at ¶ 10). Thus, counsel’s assertions that the respondent’s car suffered mechanical failure was supported by an affidavit and the repair receipt considered by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 3; Motion, tab F) was corroborative of the respondent’s sworn statement.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case lies, has stated that it is necessary to look at the “particularized facts presented in each case” in determining whether an alien has established exceptional circumstances for failing to appear for a scheduled removal hearing. See Singh v. INS, 295 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir. 2002). We find that under the case law, the respondent has established exceptional circumstances prevented her appearance at the hearing. While traffic delays due to traffic congestion are foreseeable and have been determined in other cases to not constitute exceptional circumstances, see Sharma v. INS, 89 F.3d 545 (9th Cir. 1996), we find that the respondent’s situation is distinguishable because her car failure was not foreseeable. Moreover, unlike the aliens in DeMorales v. INS, 116 F.3d 145 (5th Cir. 1997), who provided no independent confirmation that there was a mechanical breakdown of their vehicle on the way to the hearing, the respondent in this case provided written evidence in the form of a receipt verifying that her car had mechanical difficulties on the day of the hearing. Although we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s failure to contact the Immigration Court demonstrates a lack of diligence, we nevertheless find, on balance, based on the “particularized facts” presented in this case, that the respondent demonstrated exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. See Singh, supra.
 
Because we will sustain the appeal, and reopen and rescind the in absentia order, we do not address the respondent’s alternative contention that her was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, the removal order is rescinded, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

In a footnote, the Immigration Judge recognized that two motions to reopen had been filed. She held that, because she was adjudicating only the second motion, the time and number limits would not apply (I.J. at 2, n.1).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bob S. Platt, Esquire
*1 On July 12, 2005, the Board found that the respondent’s appeal had been withdrawn. We accordingly returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action. On July 1, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board, which we construe as a request to reconsider the July 12, 2005, withdrawal order. The respondent urges he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to the motion, which will be denied.
 
As a general matter, the Board will not reconsider a case where it has not previously considered the merits in the first instance.1 See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). However, the Board may rule upon a motion that challenges the treatment of an appeal as withdrawn to the extent that the motion challenges whether that withdrawal was proper. Cf. Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). In his motion, the respondent urges reopening in light of numerous alleged tactical errors committed by counsel, which he claims ultimately deprived him of an opportunity to challenge the Board’s March 25, 2004, decision sustaining the DHS’s appeal. We construe the motion as a challenge to the withdrawal of the appeal, based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely by nearly 6 years. The time limits for motions to reopen or reconsider may be equitably tolled where an alien raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). To prevail with such a claim, however, an alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence in raising the claim and must show that he has been prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679-80 (9th Cir. 2011); Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
We find that the respondent has not shown that equitable tolling of the time limits is warranted. The respondent has not persuaded us of his diligence in raising his ineffective assistance claim. Importantly, he has not provided an adequate explanation as to why he did not raise a claim of ineffective assistance against former counsel in a timely manner. In an affidavit accompanying his motion, the respondent states only that, “[a]fter [his] case was lost with Mr. Young, [his] brother in law looked into whether there were other attorneys that could help. [H]is brother-in law-and sister-in laws-friend [sic] knew of Mr. Bob Platt. [He] came to see Mr. Platt and [he] hired him to get [his] case reopened” (Affidavit dated June 2, 2011, at § 5). This summary description does not apprise us of what steps the respondent took, or why he waited over 6 years to file the instant motion. We therefore find insufficient evidence of due diligence to support equitable tolling. See Avagyan v. Holder, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cynthia R. Lopez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On March 21, 2011, the Immigration Judge issued an order granting the respondent voluntary departure until July 19, 2011. On August 12, 2011, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s order because the respondent’s Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), was not received at the Board until July 18, 2011, and was therefore untimely. On August 19, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent states in his motion that he repeatedly attempted to find an attorney after the Immigration Judge granted him voluntary departure so that he could find out his rights, and that he was unable to find an attorney until the end of May 2011. The respondent alleges that he did not know about the possibility of an appeal and did not know about any time limits. He seeks reopened proceedings in which to be considered for relief, but he does not claim to be eligible for any relief at this time.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify an error of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (finding that a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error or argue a change in law); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (noting that the very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard). The respondent has not identified any error in the decision dismissing his appeal as untimely. The respondent suggests that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in that his former counsel allegedly did not pursue relief other than voluntary departure. However, the respondent does not claim that his former counsel is at fault for the late filing of the Notice of Appeal. Furthermore, the respondent does not claim to have been actually eligible for relief other than voluntary departure at the time of the hearing.1
 
The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

The record shows that the respondent’s former attorney moved to have proceedings terminated on the basis that the respondent had health problems and also that a family-based visa petition filed on his behalf had been approved, although a visa was not yet available (Exh. 3). The motion was opposed by the Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration Judge denied the motion (Exhs. 3-4).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael E. Piston, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 Alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent timely requests reopening of these proceedings. However, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error or prejudice. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); see also Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-31 (2d Cir.2008). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Despite his claim that former counsel(s) failed to inform him of the need to submit certain documentary evidence, i.e., the life insurance policy, New York State identification cards, undated photographs, proof of joint filing of 2001 federal income tax return, and the joint bank account statement to the Immigration Judge, such evidence was submitted to the Board on appeal and found insufficient to establish the bona fide nature of the respondent’s former marriage. Furthermore, such evidence is not responsive to the full breadth of both the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s reasoning, namely that the respondent and his former wife provided materially different accounts of their wedding day. On this record, no prejudice from any possible ineffective assistance of counsel has been shown. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Roxana Castaneda, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric Pedersen
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The Board’s final administrative decision was issued on September 24, 2010. The respondent’s timely motion to reopen for adjustment of status was denied in a June 27, 2011, decision, because the motion was filed after the respondent’s period of voluntary departure expired. On July 19, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and reopen proceedings, based on a claim that ineffective assistance of former counsel warrants equitable tolling of the limitations on reopening. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Notwithstanding the respondent’s disagreement with our denial of reopening and our evaluation of the evidence, we find no error of fact or law in our decision denying reopening.
 
The respondent’s current motion to reopen, filed more than 90 days after our September 24, 2010, final administrative decision is untimely and exceeds the single motion to reopen permitted. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Equitable tolling of the limitations for a motion to reopen is available to an alien who has filed with the Board an otherwise untimely motion in which he or she raises allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien is prevented from timely filing of the motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002), and cases cited therein.
 
As we find the arguments of the DHS in its opposition to reopening persuasive, the motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent was clearly aware of the voluntary departure order and the penalties for failure to comply with that order. Even had the filing of the respondent’s motion to reopen after the period of voluntary departure expired amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, the statutory bars on relief would nonetheless apply. See Granados-Oseguera v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 1011, 1016 (9th Cir. 2008). There is no “exceptional circumstances” exception to the voluntary departure requirement where, as here, the respondent was notified of the voluntary departure order. See Serrano v. Gonzales, 469 F. 3d 1317, 1319 (9th Cir. 2006).
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider the Board’s June 27, 2011, decision denying reopening and the motion to reopen proceedings are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gene E. Hays, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescind and reissue Board decision
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 12, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 10, 2009, decision sustaining the charge of removability under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i), denying the respondent’s request to administratively close proceedings, and ordering her removed to Mexico. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. She also moves the Board to rescind and reissue its April 12, 2011, decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion, which will be denied.
 
We conclude that the respondent has not shown that her removal proceeding was so fundamentally unfair by counsel’s performance that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case. See Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 771 (9th Cir. 2008) (explaining that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must, in addition to satisfying the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), “demonstrate first that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, and, second, that she was prejudiced by counsel’s performance”).1
 
The respondent generally asserts that prior counsel, James Rosenberg, Esquire, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file any motions, applications for relief, or objections to the evidence presented, and also for failing to advise her of possible alternative strategies. Specifically, the respondent identifies two avenues for relief that she asserts Mr. Rosenberg should have pursued, namely adjustment of status based on the respondent’s United States citizen daughter, and cancellation of removal based upon her alleged continuous physical presence in the United States since prior to January 1, 1972. Both of these avenues of relief, however, would have been futile for prior counsel to have pursued.
 
The respondent, having been found removable under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, is not eligible to pursue adjustment of status, as alien smuggling under this section of the Act renders the respondent inadmissible to the United States. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Moreover, the respondent, who became a lawful permanent resident in June 2007, did not have the requisite period of continuous lawful residence in the United States to be eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), as all prior entrances into the United States were without admission (Tr. at 5-7). The Immigration Judge and Mr. Rosenberg discussed avenues of relief for the respondent but, based on the circumstances, Mr. Rosenberg concluded that the respondent qualified for no relief from removal (Tr. at 4-7).
 
*2 As for the respondent’s assertion that Mr. Rosenberg rendered ineffective assistance by not filing any motions or objections to the evidence presented by the DHS, she has neither identified a motion that could have been filed, nor indicated how the failure to file such a motion prejudiced her. Likewise, the respondent has neither identified to which specific evidence Mr. Rosenberg should have objected, nor shown that the failure to raise an objection prejudiced her. For example, insofar as the respondent contends that Mr. Rosenberg should have objected to the admission of her statements to the DHS because Miranda warnings were not issued, the Board previously concluded in its April 12,2011, decision, that such warning were not required to be given.
 
Finally, the respondent appears to assert that Mr. Rosenberg failed to advise her that she could have filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on this basis she requests the Board to rescind and reissue its April 12, 2011, decision. Although in rare cases we have reissued decisions in order to remedy a lack of notice arising from the ineffective assistance of an alien’s counsel of record, this is reserved for very exceptional circumstances not present here. Also, the respondent has not shown that in this instance Mr. Rosenberg rendered ineffective assistance. The record indicates that, although no motion to withdraw or to substitute counsel was filed with the Immigration Court, Mr. Rosenberg last appeared on behalf of the respondent at the May 13, 2008, hearing. Thereafter, new counsel, Michael Brooks, Esquire, appeared on the respondent’s behalf at the respondent’s final hearing on April 10, 2009, and the respondent was represented by different counsel, Serena A. Siew, Esquire, on appeal to the Board. The respondent has not shown that competent counsel, representing the respondent at the stage in proceedings that Mr. Rosenberg represented the respondent, would have advised her that she could file a petition for review, or that an attorney at that stage of proceedings had a duty to do so. Further, the respondent has not shown that Mr. Rosenberg’s alleged failure to advise prejudiced her. Also, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance by Mr. Brooks or Ms. Siew. The following order will thus be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and to rescind and reissue is denied.

Given that we will deny the respondent’s motion based upon our conclusion that the respondent did not establish mat counsel rendered ineffective assistance, we need not address, as moot, whether the respondent fully complied, or was required to fully comply, with the Board’s procedural requirements in Matter of Lozanda, supra.

File: AXXX XX9 849 - Los Angeles, CA
October 13, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edgardo Quintanilla, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on July 1, 1998, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on June 15, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied it on July 1, 2011, and this appeal and motion to remand followed. The appeal will be dismissed and motion will be denied.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent requests that the Board remand these proceedings to require the transcription of the July 1, 1998, hearing. The respondent makes the request because the record does not contain the Immigration Judge’s written removal order. He argues that he would be denied due process if the record is devoid of either the written order of removal or a transcript of the hearing reflecting that order.
 
It is true that the record does not contain the July 1, 1998, in absentia removal order. The issue is whether the absence of the removal order, without a hearing transcript, prejudices the respondent’s case. The respondent conceded in his motion to reopen that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on July 1, 1998. See Motion to Reopen at 2. As reflected in his decision, the Immigration Judge listened to the tape recording of the July 1, 1998, hearing. He stated that the recording revealed that the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. It also revealed that the respondent’s counsel received the hearing notice and was present at the hearing. Since the respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s findings we find a transcription of the hearing is not necessary.1 While it is an anomaly that the written removal order is not in the record, its absence has not prejudiced the respondent.
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received the required hearing notices. The charging document was served personally on the respondent on March 10, 1998. The Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record at that time, thus constituting service on the respondent (Exh. 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5.
 
Insofar as the respondent claims that former counsel’s failure notify him constitutes an “exceptional circumstance” warranting reopening, the respondent has not raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former counsel. The respondent is also time-barred from raising that particular argument. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Without an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent cannot establish that the motions deadline should be equitably tolled. See generally Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the motions deadline may be equitably tolled where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error).
 
*2 Insofar as the respondent suggests, by and through counsel, that his eviction due to a family dispute is an exceptional circumstance, this issue is untimely raised.2 See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act (such order may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances). Alternatively, the respondent’s eviction is not an exceptional circumstance within the meaning of section 240(e)(1) of the Act. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
The respondent asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent has failed to present exceptional circumstances which would support sua sponte reopening under the standards set forth in Matter of J-J-, supra. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kristen M. Kenney, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in this case on June 30, 2011, and on August 19, 2011, the respondent filed this timely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the motion. The motion will be granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent was charged with being subject to removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony (theft offense) based on his conviction on January 26, 2007, in Massachusetts, for knowingly receiving stolen properly in violation of the Massachusetts General Laws, for which a sentence of at least 1 year was imposed. See Notice to Appear (Exhibit 1). See also sections 101(a)(43)(G), 237(a)(2)(A)(iii)of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(G), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The respondent has now offered evidence in support of his claim that on August 4, 2011, the criminal court granted a motion pursuant to Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure (Mass. R. Crim. P.), Rule 30(b) (“The trial judge upon motion in writing may grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done. Upon the motion the trial judge shall make such findings of fact as are necessary to resolve the defendant’s allegations of error of law”), and revised the sentence imposed on the conviction underlying the charge of removability to 364 days. See Motion Exhibit D (Certified Copy of the front page of the motion with judge’s notation that the motion was granted); Motion Exhibit E (Certified Docket Sheet, Docket Nos. 0602CR001545 and 0602CR5030). The respondent asserts that the motion before the criminal court was based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
Sections 101(a)(43) and 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act provide that the term “aggravated felony” means a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. It appears that the criminal court revised the respondent’s sentence to 364 days to resolve an error of law. Upon consideration, the Board will grant the respondent’s unopposed motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the effect of the criminal court’s action on these proceedings. See generally Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that if a court vacates a conviction based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings, there is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes); Matter of Song, 23 I&N Dec. 173 (BIA2001) (explaining that where a criminal court vacated the 1-year prison sentence of an alien convicted of a theft offense and revised the sentence to 360 days of imprisonment, the alien does not have a conviction for an aggravated felony within the meaning of section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.1
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

As these proceedings will be reopened, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal is rendered moot.

IN RE: ABRAHAM BRADLEY
File: AXXX XX9 815 - Oakdale, LA
October 5, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on August 16, 2011, when we found the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim to be insufficient and dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely. On September 6, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Board based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a brief in opposition to the motion. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion is both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See 0-S-G-, supra; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent requests that we reconsider our prior decision, but also proffers additional evidence (see Respondent’s Motion, Tabs 1-6). Consequently, we shall treat the respondent’s motion as both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen.
 
To the extent the respondent’s motion is a motion to reconsider, it does not specify errors of fact or law in our prior decision and is not supported with pertinent authority (see generally Respondent’s Motion). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, supra. To the extent the respondent’s motion is a motion to reopen reasserting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it does not comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s motion is not supported with evidence that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate bar or an adequate explanation for the failure to file such a complaint. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000). Instead, the respondent has filed a letter from a Joey Melancon indicating that the family “requested” that his former counsel appeal his case (Respondent’s Motion at 2, Tab 1); and has not filed a bar complaint “because he never knew.” (Respondent’s Motion at 3).1
 
*2 Further, the respondent has provided his former counsel’s response to his allegations, in which she disputes that she agreed to file an appeal on his behalf and further points out that the respondent was unable to provide her any documentation to support his claim to derivative United States citizenship. Based on the totality of the evidence, the respondent has not established that his counsel was to blame for the untimeliness of his appeal. The respondent has also not provided evidence with the motion that raises a colorable claim to United States citizenship or eligibility for relief from removal. He therefore also has not demonstrated that he suffered the prejudice from his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance in the proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5 Cir. 1994). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric O. Darko, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of Mali. On April 28, 2011, an Immigration Judge ordered his removal from the United States. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on May 23, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied it on June 24, 2011, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent’s counsel incorrectly indicates in his brief that the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent was present for his hearing. It was his counsel who was absent.
 
The respondent, through counsel, argues on appeal that he did not receive a fair hearing. He contends that his counsel had requested that the Immigration Judge permit him the opportunity to represent him telephonically. He suggests that the Immigration Judge had granted counsel’s motion for a telephonic hearing and later did not permit counsel the opportunity to represent the respondent via telephone.
 
The assertion is factually incorrect. The record does not reflect the respondent’s counsel requested an opportunity to represent the respondent telephonically at the April 28, 2011, hearing. There was only such a request made for telephonic representation at an earlier hearing that the Immigration Judge granted. Thus, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge denied him a fair hearing.
 
Nonetheless, the Board finds that the respondent did not receive a fair hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s counsel indicates that the respondent is married to a United States citizen, has two citizen children, wished to adjust his status to a lawful permanent resident of the United States, and would have, at minimum, requested voluntary departure at the hearing had counsel been present to advise him. It therefore appears that counsel’s failure to appear at the hearing resulted in prejudice to the respondent by perhaps depriving him of the opportunity to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States. We will sustain the appeal finding that the respondent is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and was consequently denied a fair hearing.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and these proceedings are reopened and remanded for a hearing.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The Board issued a final order in this case on September 23, 2010. An untimely motion to reopen was filed with the Board on June 6, 2011. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Canada. The Board affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision finding him subject to removal as an aggravated felon, and denied a motion to remand, which raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The pending untimely motion to reopen first claims that the respondent acquired derivative citizenship through his mother (Respondent’s Mot., at 1, 3). As the respondent testified at the removal hearing that his parents were lawful permanent residents of the United States, while retaining French citizenship, Tr. at 5-6, this claim is without merit.
 
As on appeal to the Board, the respondent in the pending motion argues that former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not submitting an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. Aside from offering no reason for the lateness of the motion, the respondent, as on appeal, fails to show prejudice. Singh v. Holder, __ F.3d __, 2011 WL 2899607 (9th Cir. July 21, 2011). “Counsel’s deficiencies are prejudicial if they could have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id.; emphasis in original. That is, as the respondent remains convicted of an aggravated felony, he is ineligible for cancellation of removal for permanent residents. Section 240A(a)(3) of the Act; Board’s Sept. 23, 2010, decision.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rahul Chakravartty, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 2, 2010, decision denying her untimely motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b). The Department of Homeland Security did not file a response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, and review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues on appeal, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i),(ii).
 
On March 14, 2006, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). Her motion to reopen was granted on May 1, 2009, and on March 23, 2010, the respondent was granted 120 days or until July 21, 2010, to voluntarily depart under section 240B(a)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(2)(A). The respondent did not voluntarily depart by the given date, and filed an untimely motion to reopen on July 9, 2010,1 which was denied by the Immigration Judge. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent sought to reopen the proceedings in order to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), based on a pending employment-based visa petition (Form I-140). She asserted the filing requirements governing her untimely motion should have been equitably tolled based on her claims of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, Kenneth E. McKeon, Esquire.
 
Upon our de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. Equitable tolling is available if the respondent exercised due diligence in pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and demonstrated that she was prejudiced by prior counsel’s actions. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-32 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170-71 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorksi v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). While the respondent submitted2 her affidavit alleging prior counsel’s ineffective assistance and a complaint packet sent to prior counsel’s law office (see Respondent’s Motion at Tabs AA, BB, July 9, 2010), these documents do not persuasively establish that the proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir. 2007) (requiring substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements); Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 2 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556-67 (2003).
 
*2 Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s tactical decisions (I.J. Order at 2-3, Sept. 2, 2010; see Respondent’s Brief at 7-8). See Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 486 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640); see also Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270-71 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that an attorney’s decision, even if unwise in hindsight, is a tactical decision that does not constitute ineffective assistance). The record shows the respondent was granted multiple continuances in light of her pending visa petition and her claimed eligibility for section 245(i) adjustment of status (I.J. Order at 2-3, Sept. 2, 2010). When prior counsel again requested a continuance, the Immigration Judge considered his arguments which included prior counsel’s two-page memorandum that addressed issues already known to the parties (I.J. Order at 2-3, Sept. 2, 2010; Respondent’s Motion at 3, Dec. 1, 2009).
 
Similarly, prior counsel’s tactical decision to seek the 120-day voluntary departure in light of the respondent’s pending visa petition did not show that the proceedings were fundamentally unfair, thereby prejudicing the respondent. See Jiang v. Mukasey, supra, at 270 (holding that where an attorney advises a client, as a tactical matter, to seek voluntary departure rather than pursue other forms of relief, the proceedings remain fundamentally fair). The case was adjourned until March 23, 2010, to provide the respondent the opportunity to consider voluntary departure in lieu of a removal order and to accommodate the completion of her business school studies (I.J. at 2). See Debeatham v. Holder, supra, at 485; Jiang v. Mukasey, supra, at 270-71. Thus, the Immigration Judge properly considered the factors set forth in Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009), and determined that good cause was not shown to continue the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; see Elbahja v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2007); Morgan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 549, 551 (2d Cir. 2006); see Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).
 
Finally, we will not exercise our sua sponte authority, which is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations, to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003 2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). We note the record does not adequately establish the respondent’s prima facie eligibility to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act, and does not reflect that the respondent’s visa petition has been approved with a current priority date during the pendency of this appeal.3 For these reasons, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Footnotes

1

Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed prior to the expiration of the 120-day period, it automatically terminated the grant of voluntary departure and rendered the penalties inapplicable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).

2

The respondent’s appellate brief does not indicate whether the Lozada complaint packet was sent to the appropriate disciplinary authorities (Respondent’s Brief at 6-7). The appellate brief also does not indicate whether prior counsel replied to the Lozada complaint. See Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 485 (2d Cir. 2010) (expressing the Lozada requirements are aimed, in large part, informing prior counsel of the alleged ineffectiveness and providing him the opportunity to respond).

3

In December 2009, when the respondent’s prior counsel made the tactical decision to accept a grant of the maximum period of voluntary departure, visas were available only for petitions filed prior to June 2002 (I.J. at 2, Respondent’s appeal brief at 7). The respondent’s priority date is December 1, 2006 (I.J. at 2). Although the respondent optimistically stated in her appeal brief that a visa might become available to her “in approximately 3 months,” from the filing of the brief in October 2010, this does not establish that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s representation in December 2009. Further, we take administrative notice of the Department of State Visa Bulletin for October 2011, which shows that the current priority date for 3rd preference employment visas is December 8, 2005. Therefore, even assuming that she had established that she is a grandfathered alien based on an earlier petition that was withdrawn or denied (I.J. at 1), her priority date is still not current more than a year after the Immigration Judge denied the untimely motion to reopen.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy S. Paulick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 14, 2005, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his first motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order that was entered on September 10, 2003. The respondent filed a second, untimely motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal based on ineffective assistance of counsel on May 12, 2011. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has not specifically determined when equitable tolling should apply in a removal case. The court has held, however, that “equity must be reserved for those rare instances where, due to circumstances external to the party’s own conduct, it would be unconscionable to enforce the limitation period against the party and gross injustice would result.” Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000). A party seeking to benefit from equitable tolling must establish that he acted diligently to pursue his rights. See Chao v. Virginia Dept. of Transportation, 291 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir. 2002). The respondent has failed to show that he has been diligent in pursuing his claim. In support of his claim of diligence, he states that after the 2005 Board decision, he hired someone holding himself out to be an attorney to pursue his claim. He provides no dates for this action (Motion, Tab E) nor does he explain why he waited over 6 years from the Board’s dismissal of his appeal until he filed this motion to reopen. The attempt to contact one representative at an unspecified time over the course of 6 years does not demonstrate due diligence. Therefore he has not established that he was diligent in pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and equitable tolling of the motion time limit is not warranted. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen, and the motion to stay removal, is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Toni A. Lawson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 30, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated May 11, 2007, and reinstated a 60-day period of voluntary departure. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen nearly 3 years later, on May 9, 2011, well beyond the 90-day deadline applicable to motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent urges that the time limits should be equitably tolled because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The time limits for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where an alien raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). An alien must, however, demonstrate that he has been diligent in raising the claim and must show that he has been prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. Id.; Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
The respondent asserts he was the victim of ineffective assistance by two attorneys. First, he contends, as he did on direct appeal, that Attorney Ramoncito Ocampo rendered ineffective assistance following the denial of a visa petition by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) by failing to re-file the visa petition or appeal the CIS’s decision, and by failing to advise the respondent with respect to the Immigration Judge’s voluntary departure order. Second, he contends that Attorney Colin Greene rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file an appeal with the CIS, by mishandling the filing of a new visa petition, by failing to notify the respondent of a Request for Evidence, and by failing to file a petition for review of the Board’s decision.
 
We find the respondent has not persuaded us of his diligence in raising his ineffective assistance claims. Importantly, the respondent has not provided an adequate explanation as to why he did not raise a claim of ineffective assistance against either attorney in a timely motion. We observe that the respondent presumably received a copy of our June 30, 2008, decision in which we explained the import in this case of complying with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has submitted a declaration with his motion, but it does not adequately explain what steps he took after being advised of the Board’s decision or why it took him nearly 3 years to pursue his ineffective assistance claims. The respondent states only that he “has tried very hard to keep on top of [his] case” (Motion, tab F, Declaration dated April 29, 2011, ¶ 4). We find insufficient evidence of diligence to support equitable tolling.
 
*2 Nor do we find that an exceptional situation exists that would warrant sua sponte reopening in our discretion. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Significantly, the respondent’s failure to depart from the United States within the time period allowed for voluntary departure under the Board’s final order rendered him statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of 10 years from that failure to depart. See sections 240A(b) and 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b) & 1229c(d)(1)(B); see also de Martinez v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 759 (9th Cir. 2004) (relief could not be granted on motion to reopen filed after expiration of the voluntary departure time period). To the extent the respondent argues Attorney Ocampo did not adequately explain the Immigration Judge’s voluntary departure order to him, we find the Board’s order reinstating voluntary departure was clear, and the respondent has not argued that Attorney Greene did not provide him with a copy of that order (Motion, tab F, Declaration dated April 29, 2011, ¶¶ 2-3). Based on the foregoing, we do not find that sua sponte reopening in our discretion is warranted. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied and the stay request will be deemed moot.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arturo S. Suarez-Silverio, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopen; remand; rescind
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 12, 2010, that denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States in absentia, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on March 2, 2000. The Department of Homeland Security did not file a brief in opposition. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondent raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with regard to the actions of his former attorney, Benjamin Bratter. The respondent avers that attorney Bratter did not meet with him prior to filing documents with the Immigration Court, forged his signature, and otherwise failed to investigate relevant facts of the case (Motion at 3). The respondent further argues lack of notice of the hearing, because the notice was not sent to his attorney of record, Vikram Badrinat, but instead sent to an address unbeknownst to the respondent (Motion at 2).
 
The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500,501 (BIA 2008).
 
The Immigration Judge issued a form decision on April 12, 2010, in which he wrote “See previous orders.” In an earlier decision dated March 1, 2010, the Immigration Judge issued a form decision that reads “The OSC was personally served the [sic] January 27, 2000 hearing notice was mailed to the address on Claremont Road provided by Respondent when he was released from custody. See my order of 11/17/09.” The form order dated November 17,2009, states “Respondent fails to explain how or why it was his attorney’s fault that he did not appear at a hearing for which he received notice at his home address.” The Immigration Judge did not specifically address the respondent’s contentions regarding the respondent’s assertion that he never received a notice of hearing through his attorney, Vikram Badrinat, nor did he consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (the Immigration Judge’s decision must identify and fully explain the reasons for denial of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings). See also Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec, 462 (BIA 2002) (holding that because the Board’s fact finding ability on appeal is limited, it is important for Immigration Judges to include in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law).
 
*2 Section 239(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1), provides that written notice of the proceedings shall be provided to the alien “or to the alien’s counsel of record, if any.” Applicable regulations further provide that “[w]henever a person is required … to give or be given notice … such notice … shall be given by or to, served by or upon, made by, or requested of the attorney or representative of record, or the person himself if unrepresented.” 8 G.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
In the absence of sufficient analysis and fact finding by the Immigration Judge, the Board is unable to meaningfully review his decision. See generally Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (holding that because Board’s fact finding ability on appeal is limited, it is important for Immigration Judges to include in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57,74 (BIA 1984) (Board is appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record).
 
Given the unique circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to remand for further proceedings (including a hearing if necessary) and the entry of a new decision. Because we have remanded the case on the preceding basis, we take no position on the merits of the respondent’s appeal at this time. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings, and the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in this case on January 28, 2011, when it summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 3, 2010, written decision. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A), (E). On April 28, 2011, the respondent filed the instant untimely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney in full compliance with the procedures set froth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and his former attorney admits error in her handling of the respondent’s case. The respondent also stresses his business and family ties in the United States, and he contests the fairness of the proceedings before the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the motion. Given the particular circumstances of this case, the Board will exercise its sua sponte authority and reopen the removal proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (discussing the Board’s authority to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte in exceptional situations); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s March 3, 2010, decision is vacated and the record is remanded for a new hearing before a different Immigration Judge.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert G. Berke, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
M. Kristina DeGuzman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 26, 2011, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel. On June 24, 2011, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify an error of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent urges that the Board should revisit its denial of his motion to reopen.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia and filed a pro se motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge and a pro se appeal with the Board before obtaining counsel and filing his motion to reopen with the Board. In the motion, the respondent argued he was ineffectively represented by Attorney Sung Park, who allegedly prepared his motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge and his Notice of Appeal with the Board, notwithstanding that the motion and appeal were filed pro se. We denied the motion to reopen, finding the respondent had not substantially complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and noting that the motion had not been supported by a statement from the respondent and that there was no evidence that Attorney Park had been informed of the significant allegations against him. Urging reconsideration, the respondent now argues that the Board misconstrued counsel’s assertions (Motion at 4), and that Attorney Park’s apparent withdrawal at the in absentia hearing is not dispositive in light of his ethical obligations to the respondent (Motion at 5-8).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s contentions that our prior decision was in error. Importantly, he has not shown any error in our determination that this is a case where it is important to meet the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), which requires that, “before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond.”
 
*2 This requirement is not a mere formality, but rather serves the dual functions of discouraging baseless allegations and providing attorneys “whose integrity or competence is being impugned,” the opportunity to present their version of events if they choose to do so. Id. Moreover, providing notice to the attorney whose actions are being challenged, and allowing him or her sufficient time to respond, is a central element in this Board’s capacity to adjudicate ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent did not present evidence with his motion that Attorney Park has been apprised of the serious allegations levied against him, and has still not done so. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Frick, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s April 28, 2011, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision. He also seeks a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which is denied.
 
The respondent avers that former counsel, Kaaren Barr, provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to request a continuance pending the adjudication of his appeal of his rape conviction, and to await unspecified “comprehensive immigration reform” (Motion at 4-5). He further contends that attorney Sharon Healy erred by not raising these issues on appeal (Declaration).
 
However, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as there is no evidence that he filed a bar complaint against either attorney. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent has also not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice as a result of former counsels’ actions. The DHS has submitted evidence showing that the Court of Appeals affirmed the respondent’s rape conviction, and that his petition for review of this decision was denied. Thus, his arguments in this regard are moot. Further, he has not demonstrated “good cause” existed for a continuance. His conjecture that there will be comprehensive immigration reform and that he will qualify for relief arising out of that reform is speculative, and insufficient to demonstrate prejudicial error by either attorney. Reopening is also not appropriate in order to allow the respondent to pursue discretionary relief in the form of adjustment of status. While he has submitted evidence that he is engaged to a United States citizen, they are not married, and there is no evidence that he is the beneficiary of a viable visa petition filed on his behalf. As he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for relief, we find no basis for reopening in this regard. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and stay request are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sakina Carbide, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kim M. Kucik
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 We will not again recite in detail the procedural history at each juncture of this case, as it was set forth in our most recent decision denying reopening on February 18, 2011.1 In the February 18, 2011, decision, we denied an untimely, number-barred motion to reopen, finding that the respondent had not shown that reopening was warranted under our sua sponte authority. We indicated that we would have declined to reopen under our sua sponte authority even had there been no failure to voluntarily depart, pointing out that the respondent did not become eligible for adjustment of status until after the time period allowed for reopening had elapsed and that her subsequent eligibility for relief and the acquisition of additional equities did not constitute an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening. On April 14, 2011, the respondent filed another motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion,2 which will be denied.
 
First, the respondent contends that she has recently become eligible for a U visa through her assistance to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The DHS’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over the U visa application (Form I-918). See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). The respondent must properly file an appropriate application with the USCIS. Aliens like the respondent who are subject to an order of removal are not precluded from seeking U status. However, the filing of an I-918 has no effect on DHS’s authority to execute the final order. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). The respondent may request a stay of removal from the DHS’s United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Enforcement and Detention Operation (ERO). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 241.6(a) and 1241.6(a). If the I-918 is approved the respondent may file a motion to reopen and terminate these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(5)(I).
 
Next, the respondent’s pending motion is untimely and exceeds the single motion to reopen permitted. With respect to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, these arguments were first considered and addressed by an Immigration Judge in 2001 and thereafter by the Board. The additional evidence presented regarding the alleged ineffective assistance in support of the current motion is not persuasive. Briefly, the respondent has not shown compliance with the threshold requirements for making ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001). Moreover, she became eligible for adjustment of status after the period for timely filing a motion to reopen expired. She has failed to voluntarily depart and has failed to report as ordered when “bag and baggage” letters ordered her to do so. We again find that the respondent has not shown that equitable tolling of the limitations on motions to reopen is warranted. We also find the respondent’s becoming eligible for additional relief after the period for timely reopening expired does establish exceptional circumstances so as to provide a basis for granting reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Footnotes

1

Briefly, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent pre-hearing voluntary departure in lieu of removal in 2001, instructing her that she would be ineligible for adjustment of status should she fail to voluntarily depart. Later that year, an Immigration Judge denied a timely motion to reconsider and reopen, which was based in part on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, finding that the respondent had not complied with the threshold requirements for making such a claim and that the respondent’s assertions in affidavits of ineffective assistance were unfounded. In a decision on February 21, 2003, the Board affirmed without opinion the results of the decision below denying reopening and reconsideration and designated that decision as the final agency determination. The Board has denied subsequent motions to reopen, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has denied various petitions for review, request(s) for rehearings, and/or requests for stays of removal.

The DHS points out that two “bag and baggage” letters were issued ordering the respondent to appear for her departure to Pakistan and that she failed to report as ordered in May 2003 and August 2005, as well as the fact that respondent’s motion for a stay of removal filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on May 3, 2011, has been denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ana R. Schvartz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nora E. Norman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s order dated November 2, 2010, denying his motion to reopen proceedings.1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on August 3, 2010, after he did not appear for a removal hearing and the Immigration Judge sustained the charge of removability contained in the Notice to Appear. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not meet his burden in showing that exceptional circumstances excuse his failure to appear for the August 3, 2010, hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent argues first that he did not appear at the hearing because his prior attorney failed to notify him of the hearing. In some cases, ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute exceptional circumstances warranting reopening of proceedings. See Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 801-02 (5th Cir. 2007). We agree with the Immigration Judge, however, that the respondent did not satisfy the factors set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent did not address the requirement that prior counsel be given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, nor did the respondent address the requirement that a disciplinary complaint be filed with the appropriate authorities. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Although the respondent states on appeal that he is “in the process” of satisfying the Lozada requirements (Br. at 2), the materials submitted fall far short of compliance with the established framework. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-99 (5th Cir. 2006) (upholding the need to comply with the Lozada requirements). Accordingly, we conclude that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on the basis that the respondent did not properly establish ineffective assistance of counsel. See id.
 
*2 We also disagree with the respondent’s appellate contention that as an individual under the age of 21, the notice provided to counsel was inadequate. We first note that providing written notice of hearing to an alien’s counsel of record constitutes proper service pursuant to section 239(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2). Although the respondent argues that his age, 19 years old at the time the hearing notice was sent, constitutes an exceptional circumstance, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has previously found service of a hearing notice on a 17 year old respondent in removal proceedings to be proper. Lopez-Duron v. Holder, 609 F.3d 642, 646 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that the 17 year old had almost reached “legal adulthood”). The respondent also contends on appeal that he was not served with a copy of the charging document and therefore did not receive the warnings concerning the failure to appear contained therein (Br. at 5). The record indicates, however, that the respondent was personally served with this document (see Ex. 1). For these reasons, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not shown that exceptional circumstances excuse the respondent’s failure to appear. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Although the respondent’s appeal is also styled as a motion to remand, we conclude that the request for this remedy is properly treated as part of the appeal. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1999).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hector R. Ortega, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This case was before the Board on January 6, 2011, when we denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen these proceedings based on claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. That motion was brought more than 4 years after the final administrative order in the case on January 11, 2006. In that order, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision of February 15, 2005, that found her removable to her native Mexico for having participated in alien smuggling.1 On February 4, 2011, the respondent filed the instant motion to reconsider our January 6, 2011, order denying reopening. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must specify the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, and be supported by pertinent authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec.56 (BIA 2006). A motion to reconsider is not a vehicle for submitting additional evidence not included with prior filing. The instant motion does not demonstrate any factual or legal error in our prior decision adjudicating the respondent’s previously filed motion to reopen. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel J. Hwang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Emily C. Reece
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In an oral decision dated May 3, 2011, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable; determined that he did not apply for, and did not demonstrate eligibility for, any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Peru.1 The respondent appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was found removable on three of the four charged grounds, as convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), in conjunction with section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B); as convicted of a controlled substance violation under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act; and as convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act.2 As substantiated by conviction documents, he has March 5, 2010, Virginia convictions upon guilty pleas for two counts of possession with intent to deliver marijuana and for possession of cocaine. See Ex. 2. For those crimes, he was sentenced to three 5-year prison terms, to run concurrently for the marijuana trafficking crimes and consecutively for the cocaine possession crime. He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on or about December 5, 2006. Upon our de novo review, we find correct the Immigration Judge’s conclusions concerning the respondent’s removability and ineligibility for relief.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he wishes to pursue post-conviction relief concerning one or more of his convictions based on Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 2010 WL 1222274 (March 31, 2010), because he entered at least one defective guilty plea due to ineffective assistance from criminal counsel. He states that the government refused to issue him an “S” visa, despite his cooperation with the authorities in a criminal case. He contends that he also received ineffective assistance from his immigration counsel. He alleges that his removal proceedings were unfair.
 
To the extent that the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have granted him an additional continuance of his removal hearings, we observe that the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1997); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. In this case, the Immigration Judge allowed the respondent six previous continuances, from December 21, 2010, until January 11, 2011; from January 11, 2011, until January 25, 2011; from January 25, 2011, until March 22, 2011; from March 22, 2011, until March 29, 2011; from March 29, 2011, until April 19, 2011; and from April 19, 2011, until May 3, 2011. The first continuance was given so that the respondent could secure an immigration attorney. The second, third, fifth, and sixth continuances were given for the purpose of attorney case preparation. At the third hearing on January 25, 2011, the attorney informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent was seeking the “S” visa. The fourth continuance was granted because the immigration attorney was not present at the hearing on March 22, 2011. As of the seventh and final hearing on May 3, 2011, the respondent still had not obtained the “S” visa, and the immigration attorney mentioned the possibility of pursuing post-conviction relief as his only available option. See Tr. at 13, 25-26; I.J. at 2-3. We find that the Immigration Judge acted appropriately in not allowing a seventh continuance.
 
*2 Concerning the validity of a conviction, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on a conviction in state criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that any attack on a conviction has resulted in any vacatur or has even been filed. In Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s speculation that a conviction might be invalid, including in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality for immigration purposes of that conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). He thus stands convicted of the 2010 crimes. He has not disputed that the convictions for possession with intent to deliver marijuana are drug trafficking offenses that are aggravated felonies and also particularly serious crimes.3
 
Concerning the alleged ineffective assistance from immigration counsel, we observe that the respondent has failed to offer any evidence that substantially complies with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he further has failed to demonstrate that he suffered the requisite prejudice from counsel’s purported action or inaction such that a remand for consideration of his claim would be warranted, based on his cursory and unsupported appellate allegations. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The respondent was found to be ineligible for removal relief by the Immigration Judge. In appealing, the respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the only removal relief for which he is potentially eligible, CAT deferral, and he has not indicated that he would like to apply for such relief. At his removal hearings, he did not express any fear of torture upon his return to Peru. To the extent that the respondent contends that his removal proceedings were unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in handling his hearings, under the circumstances of this case. We also find that he has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would amount to a due process violation. See Anim v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 243 (4th Cir. 2008).4
 
*3 Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed in Arlington, Virginia through video conference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii).

2

The Immigration Judge did not sustain a fourth removability charge pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act.

3

The respondent is a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of aggravated felonies and who also has been convicted of per se particularly serious crimes, since he was sentenced to a 5-year prison term for each of the marijuana trafficking offenses. As such, the only form of removal relief for which he is potentially eligible is deferral of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 1158(b)(2)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(4) and 1208.16(d)(2) and (3).

4

On appeal, the respondent references the Sixth Amendment. As he acknowledges concerning the right to counsel, he has no constitutional right to appointed counsel as an alien in immigration proceedings, although he has a statutory right to counsel at no expense to the government pursuant to section 292 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362. In this case, the respondent has not demonstrated any violation of his statutory right to counsel. He was represented by an attorney at his second through seventh removal hearings, and he is represented on appeal by a law firm colleague of that attorney.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Stephen A. Lagana, Esquire
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 1, 2009, denying his motion to reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On January 19, 2001, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure. At this time the respondent was represented by counsel and was fully informed of the requirement that he depart the United States pursuant to this order. The respondent did not appeal from this decision. He argues that in this same month he contacted a new attorney who informed him he was not required to follow the Immigration Judge’s order but, rather, under a new law he would not be required to leave the United States if he filed a new application for relief. This attorney has since been suspended from practice. The respondent claims to have paid her $6,000 for her services, but, other than the respondent’s affidavit, no proof of any contact with this attorney has been submitted.
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge, with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). First, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangley & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). While the respondent argues that the attorney in question has already been suspended from practice, there is no proof that the respondent was, himself, ineffectively served by this attorney. In fact, other than the affidavit, there is no proof this respondent had any contact at all with the attorney.
 
The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that he was properly represented before the Immigration Court on January 19, 2001, at which time he was informed of the requirement that he depart the United States. Whether or not in 2001 he contacted the attorney who is now suspended from practice, he took no further action to determine his status until 2004, at which time he allegedly learned, from another attorney, that he was being ineffectively served by counsel. He then waited until September 2009, to file the current motion to reopen. The respondent failed to act with due diligence under the circumstances. See Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30 (1st Cir. 2010) (requiring due diligence); Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33 (1st Cir. 2009) (same). We also decline to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda L. Walker, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Senegal, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 11, 2011, denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on January 11, 2005. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), will be dismissed.1
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent’s order of removal should not be rescinded. An order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded “upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with [section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) or (2)].” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) and that notice of his January 11, 2005, hearing was sent to the respondent’s address that is listed on the NTA which was the respondent’s last known address (I.J. at 1).2 Even though the notice of hearing was returned by the Postal Service with the notation “moved left not address,” there is no requirement that the alien actually receive the notice before an Immigration Judge can order the alien removed in absentia (I.J. at 1). See Sanchez v. Holder, 627 F.3d 226, 231 (6th Cir. 2010). As the respondent does not allege that he informed the Immigration Court of his proper address, the respondent was properly charged with notice of his hearing and ordered removed in absentia. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; see also Al-Rawahneh v. INS, 38 F.App’x. 271, 276 (6th Cir. 2002) (stating that “notice of hearing sent by first-class mail to the last known address has been held to satisfy due process even if the notice is returned as undeliverable”) (citing United States v. Estrada-Trochez, 66 F.3d 733, 736 & n. 1 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding that a notice of hearing sent to an alien via first-class mail at his last known address satisfied due process requirements where the alien failed to notify the former Immigration and Naturalization Service of his new address)).
 
*2 The respondent does not explain where he was residing at the time that the notice of his hearing was sent to him on December 7, 2004. He offers no explanation as to why his hearing notice was returned as “moved left no address.” The respondent’s claim that “he used due diligence and hired counsel as soon as he learned” is vague and lacks persuasive value. He does not allege that he had any incentive to appear at his January 11, 2005, removal hearing. Accordingly, the respondent’s appellate arguments do not persuade us his failure to appear at his January 11, 2005, hearing could be attributed to improper notice as opposed to the respondent’s failure to apprise the Immigration Court of his address.
 
On appeal, the respondent also makes a reference to ineffective assistance of counsel. To the extent that the respondent appears to allege that ineffective assistance of counsel should excuse his failure to appear at his January 11, 2005, hearing, his claim is untimely. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent’s claims of due diligence are insufficient to warrant equitable tolling of the 180-day filing deadline. See Gordillo v. Holder, 640 F.3d 700, 705 (6th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that, for purposes of equitably tolling the statutory deadline for filing a motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, “the longer an alien takes to file [his] motion to reopen, the more explaining [he] has to do”). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JAMAL JAMEL MOUSA-IWAIS A.K.A. JAMEL JAMEL IWAIS A.K.A. JAMEL IWAIS
File: AXXX XX0 617 - Atlanta, GA
August 18, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christian G.A. Zeller, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 20, 2009, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen based on changed country conditions. On February 3, 2011, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen.1 The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and numerically barred.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), states that an alien may file one motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion, however, is his third motion to reopen. The motion therefore is numerically barred.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, in turn, states that motions to reopen “shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.” An Immigration Judge issued the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on August 9, 2001. The respondent, however, did not file his current motion until more than 9 1/2 years later. The respondent’s motion therefore is untimely.
 
The respondent, a native of Palestine, asks that we grant his motion pursuant to our sua sponte authority due to the exceptional circumstances of his case. In particular, he contends that he is a stateless person who cannot be removed, he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel which caused him to accept voluntary departure instead of pursuing adjustment of status, and he is now married to a United States citizen and the beneficiary of an approved visa petition.
 
The respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the respondent has not established that the attorney against whom he makes the claim actually represented him during his removal proceedings. The hearing notices in the record contain the name of a different attorney, and the record does not contain a Notice of Entry of Appearance for the respondent’s removal proceedings from the attorney against whom the respondent is making allegations. The agreement the respondent claims he signed with this attorney also does not specify that the attorney was assisting the respondent with his removal proceedings as opposed to his visa petition proceedings. See Respondent’s Motion To Reopen Removal Proceedings Sua Sponte, Tab J. Without some evidence to show that the attorney against whom the respondent is raising allegations actually represented the respondent during his removal proceedings, we cannot address the respondent’s allegations that this attorney’s conduct affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 Second, the respondent has not provided evidence to indicate either that he has notified his former attorney of the allegations against him or that he actually has filed the complaint he prepared against this attorney with the Georgia Bar. Given the seriousness of the allegations the respondent has raised, notice to his former attorney or an explanation as to why no notice was sent is necessary before we may assess the merits of the respondent’s claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra. The filing of a complaint with the proper disciplinary authorities or an explanation as to why no complaint was filed is also necessary. Id.
 
Without a supported claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we cannot conclude that the respondent has provided a sufficient explanation for remaining in this country for more than 10 years after he was required to depart voluntarily.2 We also cannot conclude that the respondent’s case involves exceptional circumstances. Becoming eligible for relief from removal after a final administrative order has been entered, as the respondent has done, is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting our consideration of an untimely motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien).
 
The respondent contends that he is stateless and that this fact adds to the exceptional circumstances in his case, but we disagree. The record includes a travel document from Palestine bearing the respondent’s name, and the respondent has submitted a copy of a birth certificate showing his birth in Palestine. The respondent has not explained adequately why he cannot obtain a new travel document from Palestine.
 
Based on the foregoing, we do not find that the respondent has submitted sufficient evidence to establish that his case involves exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority. We therefore decline to reopen his case pursuant to our sua sponte authority, and we deny his motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent filed a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with the Immigration Court on January 31, 2006. An Immigration Judge denied this motion on February 16, 2006, and the respondent did not appeal. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on July 26, 2007. An Immigration Judge denied this motion on October 12, 2007. We summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on April 20, 2009.

The respondent also has not explained adequately why he waited until January 2006 to file his first motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chester L. Wheless, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert T. Burton
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 29, 2011, declining to further continue his removal proceedings and ordering his removal to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Before the Immigration Judge, the respondent conceded his removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien who, at any time after admission, has been convicted of an aggravated felony (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 7-8). The respondent requested a continuance so that he could pursue post-conviction relief in Texas, but the Immigration Judge denied the request (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 8-10). On appeal, the respondent does not challenge his removability. Instead, he argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to continue and claims that the conviction underlying his charge of removal is invalid pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010).1
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to continue, as he has not established “good cause” for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the Immigration Judge’s discretion and will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). A collateral attack does not impair the validity of an alien’s conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). As of the respondent’s March 29, 2011, hearing, no challenge to his conviction had been filed, and his belief that the conviction may be invalid is insufficient to establish good cause for a continuance (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 7-10). See Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011) (the Board is not required to hold removal proceedings in abeyance pending motions for post-conviction relief in state court). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, requires Immigration Judges to stay proceedings while an alien pursues post-conviction relief. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-4.2 As the respondent has not shown that he was deprived of a full and fair hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a further continuance.
 
*2 The respondent also requests remand and has submitted evidence on appeal indicating that a challenge to his conviction has now been filed. In this case, the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The evidence submitted on appeal is not material to the respondent’s request for a continuance, as it does not establish that his conviction has been vacated. As noted above, unless and until the respondent’s conviction is overturned, the pendency of a collateral challenge does not affect the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, supra, at 327.
 
The respondent’s brief states that a separate motion to remand will be filed to substantiate the claim raised on appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge; however, we have not received the motion, and the brief does not indicate when it will be filed. See Respondent’s Brief at 2. As the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and current counsel’s unsupported statements in the appellate brief are not evidence, we also decline to remand on this basis. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

In that decision, the Supreme Court held that a defendant had sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a risk of removal.

The respondent also contends that the failure to continue such cases results in a “continuing” deprivation of the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Respondent’s Brief at 4. Aliens do not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in immigration proceedings. Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006). Moreover, Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not indicate that an alien may pursue a Padilla-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings in an effort to collaterally challenge a prior conviction.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Brazil, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on February 6, 2009, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on February 25, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied it on April 25, 2011, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find that the respondent has failed to establish that reopening of these proceedings based on “exceptional circumstances” is appropriate. A request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Because a request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration.
 
We acknowledge the respondent’s arguments on appeal regarding ineffective assistance of counsel in that former counsel did not request voluntary departure in the motion to reopen. However, attorney ineffectiveness did not cause the respondent’s failure to appear at his hearing. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Frick, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The Board on April 28, 2011, affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying voluntary departure under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, as a matter of discretion. The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Turkey, filed a timely motion to reopen on July 6, 2011, claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorneys who represented him before the Immigration Judge, and on appeal to the Board. The motion is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), and will be denied.
 
A respondent claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that counsel failed to perform with “sufficient competence,” Alcala v. Holder, 563 F.3d 1009, 1019 (9th Cir. 2009); Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 771 (9th Cir. 2008), such that proceedings are “so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting [his] case.” Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir. 2009)(citation omitted).
 
The respondent arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel must also show prejudice. Singh v. Holder, __ F.3d __, 2011 WL 2899607 (9th Cir. July 21, 2011). “Counsel’s deficiencies are prejudicial if they could have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id.; emphasis in original. See also Zetino v. Holder, 622 F.3d 1007, 1013 (9th Cir. 2010)(a showing of prejudice concerning an alleged due process violation “… means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation”) (citation omitted); Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365, 373 (9th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted)(same); Pagayon v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1226, 1236 (9th Cir. 2011). The respondent fails to show prejudice resulting from former counsel’s actions.
 
The respondent argues that counsel should have requested a continuance of the removal proceedings, as his conviction for third degree rape was on direct appeal (Respondent’s Mot. at 2, 4-6). Yet the Board already determined, in its April 28, 2011, decision, that the Immigration Judge committed no error in not continuing proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. In exercising discretion concerning voluntary departure, the Board may consider evidence of unfavorable conduct, including criminal conduct that has not culminated in a final conviction. Matter of Thomas, 21 I&N Dec. 20 (BIA 1994); Board’s April 28, 2011, dec.
 
*2 As for the criminal conviction, the DHS in any event presents evidence that on February 7, 2011, the Court of Appeals for the State of Washington issued an opinion concerning the respondent’s criminal appeal (DHS Opp. at 4; Exh. A). The decision remanded proceedings to the trial court solely for consideration of whether the trial court properly ordered the confidential questionnaires completed by members of the venire to be sealed. The decision of the trial court was affirmed in all other respects.
 
Moreover, the Ninth Circuit in Planes v. Holder, __ F.3d __, 2011 WL 2619105 (9th Cir. July 5, 2011), held that, under current law, the definition of “conviction” requires “only that the trial court enter a formal judgment of guilt, without any requirement that all direct appeals be exhausted or waived.” DHS Opp. at 4. Thus, the fact that a continuance was not sought pending the outcome of the criminal appeal did not cause prejudice. Id.
 
The motion also contends that counsel should have sought a continuance pending “comprehensive immigration reform” (Respondent’s Mot. at 6; Respondent’s Reply). The respondent suffered no prejudice resulting from counsel’s failure to seek an indefinite continuance for this speculative reason. As the Board stated in its April 28, 2011, decision, “[i]t is not appropriate to indefinitely continue these proceedings based on the possibility that the immigration laws [will] change in a manner that will benefit the respondent.”
 
The respondent also argues that counsel should have sought a remand to the Immigration Judge concerning adjustment of status, when the respondent married on October 25, 2010, while the appeal to the Board was pending (Respondent’s Mot. at 3,7; Respondent’s Reply).
 
The respondent fails to present clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood his marriage is bona fide, and therefore fails to show prejudice concerning this claim. Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (alien who enters into a marriage after the commencement of proceedings can have a motion to reopen for adjustment of status granted, notwithstanding the pendency of a visa petition filed on behalf of the alien by the spouse, where the alien presents clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is bona fide).
 
The respondent is required to provide evidence of joint ownership of property, joint tenancy of a common residence, commingling of financial resources, affidavits from knowledgeable third parties as to the legitimacy of their marriage, and any other documentation that is relevant to establish that the marriage was not entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of the United States. 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B); Sharma v. Holder, 633 F.3d 865, 872 (9th Cir. 2011). Sufficient evidence is not provided. Rather, the respondent presents his marriage certificate, evidence of a joint checking account, and a rental agreement.
 
*3 The respondent has not satisfied the “clear and convincing evidence” standard to overcome the presumption that the marriage is fraudulent in nature. Matter of Velarde supra. See also Malhi v. INS, 336 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir. 2003) (explaining that a motion to reopen premised on a marriage that occurred after the commencement of proceedings requires clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide); Sharma v. Holder, supra.
 
The motion to reopen will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cristina R. Lambert, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 In a decision dated June 30, 2010, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings, and she appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure by the Immigration Judge in a decision dated January 8, 2010, under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). Under the terms of that grant, the respondent was to depart the United States no later than May 8, 2010. On May 4, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking “to overturn the unfavorable decision of the Immigration Judge ordering [the respondent’s] voluntary departure.” In the motion, it was explained that the respondent’s United States citizen husband had filed a visa petition on her behalf, the petition was still pending, and the motion should not be considered time-barred since “newly obtained evidence” supported the motion.
 
In his decision (I.J. at 3), the Immigration Judge deemed the motion to be untimely, and we agree with that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Since the respondent filed her motion during the voluntary departure period, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, without penalty. The alternate removal order is now in effect. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(iii).
 
The fact that the respondent married a United States citizen, one month after she accepted a grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure and is now the beneficiary of a pending visa petition, is neither exceptional nor compelling, in terms of constituting a circumstance which would render inapplicable the time limitations on her motion to reopen. Although counsel alludes to alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel, counsel’s appellate arguments are not evidence, and there has been no showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ABRAHAM BRADLEY
File: AXXX XX9 815 - Oakdale, LA
August 16, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 On July 11, 2011, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) with this Board seeking to challenge the Immigration Judge’s February 24, 2011, decision finding him removable as charged, and ordering him removed to his native Belize. The respondent’s appeal is untimely, inasmuch as it was filed months after the March 28, 2011, due date.1
 
The respondent attributes the late filing of his appeal to ineffective assistance provided by attorney Maria Calvo, who he claims to have retained to handle his case. He contends that after the close of his removal hearing (which he explains was conducted telephonically), he “contacted” Ms. Calvo requesting that an appeal be filed in his case2 so that he could remain in the United States with his family and children. He contends that “after a recent call,” he became aware that an appeal in his case had not been filed.3
 
As pertinent here, the respondent is advancing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against attorney Calvo concerning her failure to timely file an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. However, he has not fully complied with the requirements for presenting such a claim, as delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000). Although the respondent has submitted a copy of a letter to attorney Calvo setting forth his related ineffective assistance, this letter is undated. In addition, no proof has been provided confirming that this letter was actually mailed to, and received by, attorney Calvo, such that it is established that she was given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations being made against her.
 
The respondent also contends that his family paid attorney Calvo a $500.00 retainer fee for her services. No corroborating evidence of this contention has been provided. Even assuming this representation to be true, there has been no showing that the services attorney Calvo agreed to provide included the filing of an appeal. Indeed, the record reflects that both the respondent’s attorney and the Department of Homeland Security actually affirmatively waived appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See February 24, 2011, I.J. decision (reflecting the Immigration Judge handwritten notation of “NO APPEAL,” and “B” (signifying both parties)).
 
In addition, the respondent’s submissions do not establish that he filed a bar complaint against attorney Calvo, and he had not explained why he did not do so. See Matter of Lozada, supra (requiring a showing, in part, that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not).
 
*2 The respondent’s submissions do not provide an adequate basis for taking this appeal on certification. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). Thus, his appeal is untimely, and the Immigration Judge’s decision is now final. As such, the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action.
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

File: AXXX XX9 704 - New York, NY
August 12, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Raymond Fasano, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Barbados, appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 8, 2011, decision, which was reissued on May 26, 2011, denying his motion to reopen, which was filed on April 7, 2011. He has also requested that this matter be remanded to the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. His request for a remand will be denied.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia after he failed to appear at a scheduled hearing on May 25, 2007. At the time of his hearing, he was represented by an accredited representative.1 The record reflects that the respondent, while being represented by an attorney, filed a prior motion to reopen on March 1, 2011, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on March 10, 2011. The respondent did not appeal that decision. In his April 7, 2011, motion, the respondent, while represented by a different attorney, alleged inter alia that he failed to appear at his May 25, 2007, hearing as a result of ineffective assistance of the accredited representative and that proceedings should be reopened in order to afford him the opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s April 7, 2011, motion as untimely and number-barred. In removal proceedings, aliens are permitted to file only one motion to reopen and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal.2 See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the time and number limits governing requests to reopen on the basis of the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. While, under certain situations, a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel can toll the time and number limits, the respondent does not allege that the attorney who filed his first motion to reopen was ineffective. Thus, the respondent has not presented a cognizable argument upon which the statutory limit on filing one motion to reopen could be tolled.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that the 90-day time limit should be tolled. In order to equitably toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). This includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. Id. The respondent does not allege that he was unaware that he had been ordered removed in absentia. Throughout his motion, the respondent makes no claim that he took any action during the several years that elapsed between the Immigration Judge ordering his removal and the filing of a motion to reopen in 2011. Accordingly, he has not demonstrated the requisite due diligence that would allow for equitable tolling of the 90-day deadline. See Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (holding that waiting 8 months after the receipt of documents pertinent to the alien’s claim to file a motion to reopen did not demonstrate due diligence). Accordingly, the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (or, in this case, an accredited representative) are untimely. The respondent’s appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.3
 
The respondent has also moved for a remand of these proceedings and alleges that he has a credible fear of being persecuted in Barbados.4 Like, the respondent’s April 7, 2011, motion to reopen, his request is untimely and number-barred. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000) (holding that a motion to remand submitted during the pendency of an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of an untimely motion to reopen and filed after the entry of a final administrative decision does not cure the untimeliness of the initial motion to reopen, nor is it excepted from the numerical restriction that permits the filing of only one motion to reopen); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (holding that “where a motion to remand is really in the nature of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, it must comply with the substantive requirements for such motions”). While the time and number limits can be waived upon a showing of changed country conditions arising in the alien’s country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding, the respondent has not demonstrated “changed circumstances” in Barbados since the time of his May 25, 2007, removal hearing which would warrant an exception to the time and number limits governing reopening requests. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act.
 
*3 The respondent asserts a fear of being harmed by a gang which he allegedly testified against in 1999 and 2000. While the respondent offers a letter from his mother which asserts that two of individuals against whom he testified have recently been released from prison, the letter lacks sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant reopening. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated how this alleged change materially affects his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. He does not allege that any future harm would be on account of a protected ground. As such, he has not demonstrated change circumstances which materially affect his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. Therefore, the respondent has not established that his motion is exempt from the time and number limits governing such motions. Even if not untimely and number-barred, the respondent’s speculative assertions of being harmed are insufficient to warrant a remand. See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, 421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that, absent solid support in the record for the alien’s assertion that he would be subjected to persecution, his fear was “speculative at best”); Matter of Coelho, supra, at 471 (holding that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). The respondent’s request for a remand will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a remand is denied.

Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1292.1(a)(4), a person representing an organization described in 8 C.F.R. § 1292.2 who has been accredited by this Board may represent individuals in removal proceedings. In 2011, the Board disapproved the application for re-accreditation of the individual who represented the respondent in 2007.

2

While an order of removal entered in absentia can be rescinded upon the showing the failure to appear was the result “exceptional circumstances,” such motion must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent’s motion was also untimely in this respect.

3

With his appeal brief, the respondent has presented several documents. To the extent that the respondent seeks consideration of these documents as part of his appeal, we note that the Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).

4

The record reflects that the respondent filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal with his April 7, 2011, motion to reopen. The respondent did not check the box indicating that he also wanted to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chris Christensen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lillian Alves
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s December 10, 2009, decision denying his request for a continuance. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has submitted a brief in opposition to the appeal.1 The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and matters of discretion, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Notice to Appear (Exh. 1) commencing his removal proceedings was defective, and did not in fact provide the Immigration Court with jurisdiction over such proceedings, because it did not specify the date and time at which the respondent’s first removal hearing would take place. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that a Notice to Appear is not defective simply because it indicates that a hearing time and date will be scheduled later, so long as the alien is in fact sent notice of the hearing once it is scheduled. See Popa v. Holder, 571 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2009); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b) (concerning Notices to Appear and Hearing Notices). The respondent does not allege that he lacked notice of the later scheduled hearings, and indeed he appeared at each of his removal hearings. The respondent’s argument concerning the validity of his Notice to Appear thus lacks merit.
 
The respondent further contends on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a continuance. The decision to grant or deny a continuance, if good cause is shown, is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); see also Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 1243, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent’s desire to obtain a “second opinion” concerning his removal proceedings did not amount to good cause justifying a continuance of his removal proceedings. Notably, the respondent has advanced no explanation for his failure to seek such a “second opinion” during the 5-month period that the Immigration Judge had granted him to explore whether he might be eligible for any form of relief from removal. See Tr. at 4-6, 11; cf. Delgado-Ortiz v. Holder, 600 F.3d 1148, 1150-51 (9th Cir. 2010) (explaining that motions to reopen “are particularly disfavored in immigration proceedings, where ‘every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States”’) (citing INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992)); Respondent’s Brief at Attachment C (Respondent’s Affidavit, reflecting that respondent’s dissatisfaction with former counsel arose “between the July hearing and the December hearing”). We therefore will not reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to continue.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which would warrant remand of the record for further proceedings. The respondent has not complied with any of the criteria for setting forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Nor are we persuaded by the respondent’s contention that former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the record. See, e.g., Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597-99 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
Furthermore, even if the respondent had established that former counsel provided ineffective assistance, he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced thereby. That is, he has not shown that the outcome of his case “may” have been different absent the alleged ineffective assistance of prior counsel. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2008) (reiterating that an alien may establish the requisite prejudice for purposes of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by showing that the outcome of his or her hearing “may” have been different absent deficient performance of counsel). While the respondent alleges that former counsel failed to explore certain aspects of his case, he has not raised any claims on appeal which could undermine the Immigration Judge’s determination of removability, or which reflect that the respondent may be eligible for some form of relief from removal.2 His ineffective assistance of counsel claim therefore fails.
 
We also are unpersuaded by the respondent’s appellate contention that the Immigration Judge denied him his right to be represented by the attorney of his choice. See, e.g., Ram v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 1238 (9th Cir. 2008); Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent appeared at each of his removal hearings with his attorney of record. As indicated above, the respondent has provided no explanation for his failure to obtain new counsel during the 5-month period between his initial and his final hearings. His dissatisfaction with his former counsel’s conclusion that he was ineligible for relief from removal did not require the Immigration Judge to grant him additional time to obtain new counsel.
 
The respondent also alleges that the Immigration Judge abandoned his role as neutral arbiter by questioning the respondent to determine whether there was good cause to grant his request for a continuance, and that he appeared more concerned with former counsel’s potential ethical quandary than with the respondent’s dissatisfaction with former counsel. However, Immigration Judges have broad authority to regulate the course of a removal hearing, and may receive evidence, interrogate, examine and cross-examine the alien or witnesses. See section 240(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b); 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.10(b), 12401(c). The record reflects that the Immigration Judge appropriately questioned the respondent, and properly considered the totality of the record in finding that the respondent had failed to show good cause for a continuance. See generally Vargas-Hernandez v. Gonzales, 497 F.3d 919, 926-27 (9th Cir. 2007); Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982).
 
*3 Further, as noted above, the record remains devoid of evidence that the respondent may be eligible for any form of relief from removal, or that he is not removable as charged. He thus has failed to establish the existence of prejudice. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish a due process claim necessitating remand of the record. See generally Yan Liu v. Holder, 632 F.3d 1150, 1161-62 (9th Cir. 2011) (reiterating that alien must establish prejudice in order to prevail on a due process claim).
 
In sum, the respondent has not established any jurisdictional defect or due process violation which would warrant remand of the record to the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

The respondent submitted a reply brief with a motion to accept reply brief, and the DHS has opposed such motion. As the respondent’s reply brief was submitted outside of the time set in the briefing schedule, and the respondent has not asserted surprise at any of the assertions contained in the DHS’s brief, we will not consider the arguments made in the respondent’s reply brief. See BIA Practice Manual Chapter 4.6(h).

2

For instance, the respondent asserts on appeal that former counsel provided deficient assistance by not objecting to the admission of the Notice to Appear into evidence, and by admitting the factual allegations and conceding the charge of removability on behalf of the respondent after discussing the same with the respondent, but without having seen the notice to appear. Yet the respondent admits in his affidavit that he was served with the notice to appear, and he does not challenge on appeal any of the factual allegations or the charge of removability contained therein. He therefore has shown no prejudice based on former counsel’s admissions and concessions on his behalf, or counsel’s failure to object to the admission of the Notice to Appear into evidence. His remaining assertions similarly fail to establish that he was prejudiced by former counsel’s actions.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shiva P. Gill, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victor P. Lehman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(E)(ii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii)] - Violated court protective order
  
APPLICATION: Reopening, section 212(h) waiver
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 18, 2011, finding her removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. On July 20, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, on the same date, the respondent filed a motion indicating that she no longer wished to pursue her appeal; she only wanted to pursue her motion to remand, which pertained to her eligibility for relief from removal. Given these statements, we will not review the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability. We instead will accept the Immigration Judge’s removability finding as final, and we will consider only the respondent’s arguments in her motion to remand. The respondent’s motion to remand will be denied.1
 
In her request for a remand, the respondent contends that she has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In particular, she claims that her former attorney erred by not recognizing that she was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). The respondent argues that she is eligible for a section 212(h) waiver because she made two trips outside of the United States after she was convicted of the offense which has been found to be an aggravated felony. She asserts that her former attorney knew of these trips yet did not argue that the respondent could qualify for section 212(h) relief.
 
The respondent’s claims regarding her eligibility for a section 212(h) waiver are incorrect. The respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on May 14, 1997 (Exh. 4). On April 7, 2004, she was convicted of an aggravated felony. Accordingly, she is statutorily barred from obtaining a section 212(h) waiver. See section 212(h) of the Act (stating that “[n]o waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if … since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony”); see also Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the circuit in which the respondent’s case arises, has held that the aggravated felony bar contained in section 212(h) of the Act only applies to aliens who were admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents. According to the Fifth Circuit, the bar does not apply to aliens who entered the United States or were admitted in another status and then adjusted their status to that of a lawful permanent resident once they were in the United States. See Martinez v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 532 (5th Cir. 2008). The respondent, however, does not fit within this category. The record contains clear evidence that the respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident (Exh. 4), and the respondent has not contested this fact. Accordingly, the respondent is not eligible for relief under Martinez v. Mukasey, supra.
 
In addition, the respondent does not qualify as an “arriving alien”, despite her claims. The respondent was inadmissible to the United States on the basis of her crime when she returned to this country in 2005 and in 2007, but she still did not qualify as an “arriving alien” at that time. The respondent instead was a returning lawful permanent resident who could have been charged with inadmissibility. See Matter of Abosi, 24 I&N Dec. 204, 206 (BIA 2007) (stating that a lawful permanent resident who is seeking admission to the United States after having committed a crime that makes him or her inadmissible is a returning lawful permanent resident charged with a ground inadmissibility rather than an “arriving alien” and that lawful permanent resident status ends only upon entry of a final administrative order of removal); Matter of Ayala, 22 I&N Dec. 398, 402 (BIA 1998); see also Molina-Ramirez v. Holder, 362 Fed. Appx. 387, 391-2 (5th Cir. 2010) (unpublished). Moreover, even if the respondent had been charged with inadmissibility upon one of her returns, she still would have been statutorily barred from obtaining a section 212(h) waiver due to her lawful permanent resident status and her aggravated felony conviction. Accordingly, the respondent’s trips abroad do not alter the fact that she is statutorily ineligible for a section 212(h) waiver.
 
Similarly, our ruling in Matter of Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 218 (BIA 1980) does not provide a means for the respondent to qualify for relief from removal. See Molina-Ramirez v. Holder, supra. The aggravated felony bar that now is part of section 212(h) of the Act did not exist at the time we issued Matter of Sanchez, supra, and this bar would prevent the respondent from qualifying for a section 212(h) waiver even if she could seek a section 212(h) waiver as if she had sought one when she returned to this country in 2005 or 2007.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, the respondent has not established that her former attorney provided ineffective assistance by failing to contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent was ineligible for a section 212(h) waiver. The respondent is statutorily barred from obtaining this waiver, and the respondent has not established that her attorney committed an error by not calling the Immigration Judge’s attention to the respondent’s departures from this country. The respondent therefore has not established either that the Immigration Judge erred in pretermitting her application for a section 212(h) waiver or that a remand is appropriate in her case. Accordingly, we deny the respondent’s motion to remand.
 
ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s finding of removability is accepted as final and uncontested.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: None
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 2011, decision ordering his removal from the United States. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2011); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges that his prior counsel provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by not seeking post-conviction relief on his behalf. However, the respondent has not presented an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with his prior counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations she did or did not make, the respondent does not indicate that his prior counsel has been informed of the allegations leveled against her and has been given an opportunity to respond, and the respondent does not indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of her ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA 1988). Additionally, as the respondent has not shown that, but for his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, he would have obtained post-conviction relief, he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, a remand is not warranted on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges that he qualifies for asylum and that the Immigration Judge did not give him the opportunity to apply for such relief. We disagree. While an Immigration Judge shall inform an alien of his apparent eligibility to apply for relief from removal, the respondent has not demonstrated that he is apparently eligible for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(b); Matter of Cordova, 22 I&N Dec. 966, 970 (BIA 1999) (stating that an Immigration Judge’s duty to inform applies only to forms of relief for which an alien is “apparently eligible”). The record reflects that the Immigration Judge inquired as to whether there was a reason that the respondent could not return to Ecuador and the respondent stated he wished to remain in the United States because his son was ill (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 22-23). In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent has not indicated that he is unwilling or unable to return to Ecuador because of a well-founded fear of being persecuted on account of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group or that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to Ecuador. Likewise, he has not presented an application for asylum (Form I-589). Accordingly, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to enter an order of removal in this case. The respondent’s appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Shana Martin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 10, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable based on his criminal conviction. The respondent requested, but was denied a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On October 18, 1996, the respondent was convicted of two counts of Felony Possession of a Controlled Substance (Cocaine and Heroin), in violation of Colorado law. The respondent admitted the convictions. See Tr.at 2. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). The respondent, through counsel, conceded removability for being present in the United States without authorization and for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation. See Tr. at 2. Based on the admissions and concessions, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. See Exh. 1; I.J. at 2. The respondent requested a continuance to collaterally attack the convictions pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010),1 but the Immigration Judge denied that request. See I.J. at 2; Tr. at 9.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief, and requests remand. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).2 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown.
 
*2 While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). An alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of his otherwise valid state or federal criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir. 1993); Matter of Ponce De Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; AG 1997); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974). Neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board has the authority to look beyond the record of conviction to determine the guilt or innocence of an alien in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Reyes, 20 I&N Dec. 789 (BIA 1994); Matter of Fortis, supra. Rather, such collateral attacks must be addressed to the appropriate criminal court.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in his deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates his right to counsel.

2

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

Melissa M. Desvarieux, Esquire
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 3, 2010, denying his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on June 16, 2010. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal indicating that a visa petition has been filed on his behalf. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500, 501 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he has established ineffective assistance of counsel because his former attorney advised him that there was nothing that could be done and that there was no relief so his case was finished. The respondent claims that he did not understand that he had to appear for his final hearing before the Immigration Judge. He contends that he has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and if the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge stated that the respondent had actual notice of his June 16, 2010, hearing because he was advised in open court on March 31, 2010, of the date, time and place of his next hearing. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s former counsel did not advise the respondent not to attend his hearing, but advised the respondent that he did not have any relief from removal. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period). The lack of any relief from removal did not excuse the respondent’s obligation to appear for his hearing. The Immigration Judge indicated the respondent’s former counsel did appear for the hearing on June 16, 2010, and waited from 8:30 a.m. until about noon for the respondent to appear. See I.J. Dec. dated August 3, 2010, at 1. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent has not shown with sufficient evidence that former counsel acted ineffectively to the respondent. We therefore find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of St. Kitts-Nevis and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, timely appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 17, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), denied his request for a fourth continuance, and, in the absence of any applications for relief for which he was eligible, ordered the respondent removed from the United States to St. Kitts-Nevis. The respondent’s request for oral argument before this Board is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The evidence establishes that on February 23, 2009, the respondent was convicted following a plea of guilty to the offense of attempted robbery in the third degree, in violation of Title 14, V.I.C. § 331, and Title 14, V.I.C. §§ 1861,1864, for which he was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment (I.J. at 2: Exh. 2 at 18-20; Tr. at 40-41). At his hearing, the respondent admitted the factual allegations and conceded removability as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act (I.J. at 2,3: Tr. at 41). On appeal, the respondent does not appear to challenge the Immigration Judge’s determination that his conviction renders him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. Rather, he argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for an additional continuance to permit him to collaterally challenge his conviction in criminal court based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The decision whether to grant a continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R.§§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Thus, an Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance request will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent establishes that the denial deprived him of his due process right to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996) (citing Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987)). The alien must show actual prejudice materially affecting the outcome of the case resulted from the denial of the continuance. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). As a general rule, an Immigration Judge need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based upon the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. The respondent had (and has) a valid “conviction” for immigration purposes, and his collateral attack upon that conviction does not operate to negate its validity until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that the 2009 Virgin Islands conviction underlying these removal proceedings has been vacated, and therefore the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request has compromised the fairness of his removal proceedings. The respondent references the recent decision of Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s speculation that his conviction might be invalid, including in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such a conviction, unless and until such conviction is actually overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). Notably, the respondent repeatedly told the Immigration Judge that he, or persons acting on his behalf, had or would soon file a motion to challenge his conviction in criminal court based on the ruling in Padilla. The Immigration Judge continued proceedings on three occasions for the specific purpose of permitting the respondent to file such a motion and to submit evidence that such a challenge had been filed with appropriate authorities. However, when the respondent did not provide evidence that such a challenge had been filed at the time of the hearing held on March 17, 2011, she denied his fourth request for a continuance (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 36-39). Given that the Immigration Judge provided the respondent multiple opportunities to file a Padilla-type challenge to his conviction, and no evidence has been presented that such a motion has even been filed, much less granted, we find no basis to reverse the Immigration Judge’s denial of the final continuance request in this matter.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin G. Randolph, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Musto
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 2, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. He has filed a timely motion to reopen premised on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes reopening.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations being leveled and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish prejudice as a result of the attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). To establish prejudice, an alien must show that it is likely that the alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In this case, the parties dispute whether the respondent has complied with the second procedural requirement in Lozada, namely, that he notify his former counsel of the allegations and give counsel an opportunity to respond. However, we need not decide this question, because we find that the respondent is not able to demonstrate prejudice.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ineligible for adjustment of status due to his inadmissibility under section 212(a)(10)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(10)(D), for having voted in the United States in violation of any law (I.J. at 4). In the affidavit accompanying his motion to reopen, the respondent states that he voted in “the 2004 election,” and the record demonstrates that this was the federal general election in November of 2004 (I.J. at 4; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tabs 1 & 14; Exh. 3 at 8).
 
*2 With narrow exceptions not applicable here, aliens are prohibited by federal statute from voting in federal elections. 18 U.S.C. § 611. This statute defines a crime of general intent, which requires proof that a violator “knowingly engaged in the conduct prohibited by” the statute, regardless of whether the violator knew that the conduct was illegal. See United States v. Knight, 490 F.3d 1268, 1270-71 (11th Cir. 2007); see also Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1, 5 (2006) (holding that “unless the text of the statute dictates a different result, the term ‘knowingly’ merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense”) (citations omitted). The respondent admits that he knowingly voted in an election, and that he knew he was not then a citizen. This conduct is sufficient for conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 611. Accordingly, the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(10)(D) of the Act, for which no waiver is available, and he has not demonstrated prejudice sufficient to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karl H. Goodman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brian M. Fish
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s April 6, 2011, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia on February 2, 2011, under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), after the respondent failed to appear. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed the respondent’s motion and his appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was removed from the United States subsequent to the taking of the appeal in these proceedings.¿FN1º This departure results in the withdrawal of this appeal, and the initial decision of the Immigration Judge is accordingly final to the same extent as though no appeal had been taken. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4. However, even if the respondent’s removal did not result in the withdrawal of his appeal, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice of his hearing date and did not establish that exceptional circumstances excused his failure to appear at his removal hearing.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999).
 
The hearing notice, dated December 8, 2010, shows that both the respondent and his prior counsel received personal service of the notice. See Matter of Munoz-Santos, 20 I&N Dec. 205, 206 (BIA 1990) (holding that there is sufficient proof of proper service if the evidence shows that the notice of hearing was personally served on the alien); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the alien); section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(b).
 
*2 The respondent argues that his failure to appear at his removal hearing was due to exceptional circumstances.¿FN2º In his appeal brief, the respondent asserts that he mistakenly believed that his hearing date was February 8, 2011, instead of February 2, 2011, because his English is poor and he was not provided with an Arabic translator at any of his hearings. However, in his motion to reopen, the respondent asserted that he was confused as to the correct date because the Arabic pronunciation of 8 and 2 is similar. These two explanations are inconsistent. Consequently, he has not demonstrated that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances. The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). For the foregoing reasons, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

There is no automatic stay while on appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a motion to rescind an in absentia order in removal proceedings.

2

To the extent that the respondent argues that his prior counsel’s withdrawal from the case foreclosed a pre-hearing meeting where the correct hearing date would have been discussed, we reiterate that the record shows that the respondent was personally served with the hearing notice. In any event, the respondent has neither meaningfully asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his prior attorney nor complied with the procedural requirements in making such a claim.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas A. Lappin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy C. Martin
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated August 26, 2010, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and granted him voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) (pre-conclusion voluntary departure). He did not depart, but instead filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge prior to the expiration of his voluntary departure period claiming ineffective assistance of counsel by his former attorney, and arguing in favor of his eligibility for cancellation of removal as well as his potential eligibility for relief under “the DREAM Act.”
 
On January 14, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely, and noted in part that he failed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent appealed and filed an appellate brief with this Board. He also requested a stay of removal, which was denied June 9, 2011. He was removed the same day.¿FN1º
 
Inasmuch as the respondent was removed from the United States, his appeal is deemed withdrawn. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4. Alternatively, we would dismiss his appeal. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely. Indeed, the respondent conceded this point. Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 3; Brief on Appeal (Brief) at 3. On appeal, he continues to assert that the filing deadline of his motion should be equitably tolled because his conviction does not provide a proper basis for his removal.¿FN2º Brief at 3-4. However, pursuant to the statute and regulations, a motion to reopen may only be excused under very limited circumstances, none of which are presented in this case. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23 (regarding reopening requests before the Immigration Judge) and 1003.2(c) (regarding motions to reopen before the Board).
 
Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the time restrictions governing the filing of motions to reopen may be equitably tolled under certain circumstances in cases involving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, no such circumstances have been demonstrated here. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent offered no explanation for the late filing of his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge.¿FN3º There also was no showing that he was prevented from timely filing his motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge because of deception, fraud, or error.
 
*2 Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen was correctly denied as untimely. His motion was also correctly denied for failure to demonstrate compliance with the Lozada requirements concerning the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that were made.¿FN4º As for sua sponte reopening, the respondent did not show exceptional circumstances warranting such reopening. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(a).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

From the record, it is not clear whether the respondent’s removal was voluntary or involuntary.

2

The respondent’s removability is not premised on his having been convicted of a crime. Instead, he was charged with removability only under section 212(a)(6) of the Act, as an alien who was present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrived in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General. His removability on this charge remains undisputed.

3

No declaration or statement by the respondent was submitted with his motion to reopen.

4

The allegations of ineffective assistance against the respondent’s former attorney were advanced only by current counsel, not by the respondent himself. It is well settled that statements by counsel do not constitute evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 1983), n. 2.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 19, 2011, when we denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. On March 7, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The motion will be denied.
 
The motion to reconsider is untimely, as it was not filed within 30 days of the Board’s decision that it asks us to reconsider. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondent, however, urges that we should consider his motion timely, because he had submitted the motion on February 18, 2011, within 30 days of the Board’s prior decision, although that filing was rejected on the ground that the certificate of service was served on the wrong DHS office. The respondent argues that the certificate of service was served on the correct DHS Chief Counsel’s office at 2500 Second Avenue in Seattle, Washington, because he is no longer in DHS custody. However, the certificate of service for the motion submitted on February 18, 2011, indicated that a copy of the document was sent not to this address, but to 29500 Second Avenue in Seattle, Washington.¿FN1 º Therefore, we are not persuaded that the certificate of service for the February 18, 2011, filing was proper such that the motion to reconsider should be considered timely. There is no statutory or regulatory exception for the 30-day time limits for motions to reconsider.
 
Even if the motion were timely filed and we were to address the merits of the arguments raised in the motion, we would still deny the motion to reconsider. In the motion, the respondent argues that the Board erred in the prior decision in finding that he had not shown due diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney, Mr. Michael Jacob. In our prior decision, we noted that more than 2 years had elapsed between the Board’s dismissal of the respondent’s appeal on August 25, 2008, and the filing of his motion to reopen on December 1, 2010, and he had not shown that he exercised due diligence during this period such that his motion should be exempt from the time limits on motions to reopen. The respondent argues that he acted with due diligence because his case or cases have been pending at the district court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit during that period, and in fact his petition for review from the Board’s dismissal of his appeal was still pending when he filed the current motion to reconsider (Motion at 6-7; Motion Exhs. B, C).
 
*2 The Ninth Circuit has held that the 90-day filing period for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled when an alien is prevented from filing the motion to reopen “because of deception, fraud, or error” of the attorney, as long as the alien acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). Therefore, the pertinent consideration for equitable tolling is not necessarily whether a case has been pending for the alien, but whether the alien was prevented from filing a motion to reopen and pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim because of deception, fraud, or error of the attorney, and how the alien acted with due diligence in discovering such deception, fraud, or error. In this case, the docket sheet for the respondent’s petition for review submitted in the motion shows that a motion to withdraw Mr. Jacob as counsel was filed on December 26, 2008, and the Ninth Circuit granted this motion on February 17, 2009 (Motion Exh. B, at 3). The docket sheet for the respondent’s petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington does not indicate that Mr. Jacobs was representing the respondent in this case, such that the respondent had a reason to continue to rely on his advice and assistance (Motion Exh. C).
 
Therefore, the respondent was no longer represented by Mr. Jacob as of February 17, 2009, and he has not shown that he had any reason to rely on Mr. Jacob’s legal advice or assistance since that date, or possibly since December 26, 2008. Nevertheless, the respondent did not show in his motion to reopen how he acted with due diligence since that time. Therefore, we are not persuaded that our prior decision finding that the respondent did not show due diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Mr. Jacob was in error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondent also argues that the Board erred in the prior decision in finding that he had not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In our prior decision, we noted, among other thing, that the respondent did not support his motion with an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement he had with Mr. Jacob with respect to the actions to be taken. Matter of Lozada, supra. In his motion to reconsider, the respondent now seeks to “correct ¿theº shortcoming” in his failure to submit an affidavit, and has included a declaration in his motion (Motion at 3-6). However, the respondent has not argued, or much less shown, why his statement could not be submitted with his motion to reopen. In any event, a motion to reconsider is not a mechanism by which a party may submit evidence or legal arguments that could have been submitted earlier, but a mechanism to challenge the correctness of the decision based on the previous factual record. Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 57-58.
 
*3 In sum, the respondent’s motion to reconsider was untimely and, even if it were timely filed, it would not persuade us that our prior decision denying his motion to reopen was in error. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James S. Sarpong, Esquire
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on March 10, 2011. The appeal was accordingly due on or before April 11, 2011. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on June 10, 2011. We find that the appeal is untimely.
 
The respondent also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in her Notice of Appeal, arguing that her prior attorney was ineffective and did not explain the removal proceedings or the consequences or benefits of voluntary departure. These vague allegations are insufficient to warrant certification in this case because the respondent does not claim that any ineffective assistance of counsel relates to the untimely filing of her appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). The Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15. The record before us indicates that the respondent may have waived appeal. In view of our disposition of this case, we need not determine whether the respondent made a knowing and intelligent waiver in this case.
 
Because we are dismissing the appeal as untimely and thus have not reached its merits, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See generally Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) & (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) & (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) & (B) and (c)(7)(A) & (C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anoop Prasad, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 31, 2009, denying her motion to reopen proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also moves for a stay of removal. The record will be returned to the Immigration Court. The request for a stay of removal is granted.
 
In the adjudication of a motion to reopen, an Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain his decision so that the parties will not be deprived of the opportunity to contest the judge’s determination on appeal and the Board will be able to meaningfully exercise its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994); see also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). The Immigration Judge’s decision in this case merely states that the respondent failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and indicates that the motion was also denied in the exercise of discretion. As presently constituted, the decision is devoid of any fact-finding or legal analysis and does not provide us with a meaningful basis for review. See generally Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 463-65 (BIA 2002). We will return the record to the Immigration Judge for the entry of a more complete decision. Upon preparation of the full decision, the Immigration Judge shall issue an order administratively returning the record to the Board. The Immigration Judge shall serve the administrative return order on the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security. The Board will thereafter give the parties an opportunity to submit briefs in accordance with the regulations.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s removal is stayed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Molot, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mele Moreno
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on June 2, 2011, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider this decision on June 16, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted various court documents in support of his claim that he continues to collaterally attack his conviction for a controlled substance violation. As such, we will consider the respondent’s motion as a timely motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent argues that, pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), his case should be remanded for further proceedings because, he argues, he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal proceedings.
 
Notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions, the respondent has submitted no indication that the Court changed the disposition of his conviction in alignment with Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). See also Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007). As we found in our previous decision, without such evidence, we find no reason to remand the record for further proceedings regarding the current nature of the respondent’s criminal history and its finality for immigration purposes (Bd. Dec. at 1-2). Id; Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The motion will be, therefore, denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lynn G. Javier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2010, decision denying his second motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen and to rescind is number-barred (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). As for the respondent’s assertion that he did not receive notice from counsel, to the extent that he is claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has not shown due diligence in pursuing his rights, as he was served with the Warrant for Arrest of Alien (Form I-200) in 1998, and waited over 10 years to file his motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
MATTER OF RONALD S. SALOMON, RESPONDENT
Decided as amended July 12, 20111
**1 *559 Nonidentical reciprocal discipline of an attorney does not amount to a “grave injustice” under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.103(b)(2)(iii) (2011) where the attorney has engaged in wide-ranging misconduct and was disciplined in multiple jurisdictions.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Chris M. McDonough, Esquire,
Westbury, New York
FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION REVIEW, OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL:
Scott Anderson,
Deputy Disciplinary Counsel
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Eileen M. Connolly,
Chief, Immigration Court Practice Section - East
BEFORE: Board Panel: HOLMES and GUENDELSBERGER, Board Members; KENDALL CLARK, Temporary Board Member.
HOLMES, Board Member:
The respondent will be suspended from practice before the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Immigration Courts, and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) for a period of 6 months.2
 
On October 14, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an order suspending the respondent from the practice of law for 3 months, effective 28 days from the date of that order. Consequently, on November 1, 2010, the Disciplinary Counsel for the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”) petitioned for the respondent’s immediate suspension from practice before the Board and the Immigration Courts. The DHS then asked that the respondent be similarly suspended from practice *560 before that agency. Therefore, on November 23, 2010, we suspended the respondent from practicing before the Board, the Immigration Courts, and the DHS pending the final disposition of this proceeding.
 
The respondent has filed a timely answer to the allegations contained in the November 1, 2010, Notice of Intent to Discipline, which proposed a nonidentical reciprocal discipline of 6 months’ suspension. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.105(c)(1) (2011). The respondent does not dispute the allegations in the Notice of Intent to Discipline, and he does not seek a hearing. The respondent objects only to the imposition of a 6-month suspension, rather than a 3-month suspension. We therefore find it appropriate to issue a final order on the Government’s charges. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.106(a)(1) (2010); see also 73 Fed. Reg. 76,914, 76,925 (Dec. 18, 2008) (providing that in summary disciplinary proceedings, the Board may issue a final order when the respondent’s answer does not make a prima facie showing that there are any material issues of fact in dispute).
 
We agree that the EOIR Disciplinary Counsel’s proposed nonidentical reciprocal discipline of 6 months’ suspension is justified under the totality of the circumstances. In that regard, we consider the fact that the respondent has been subject to disciplinary proceedings for wide-ranging misconduct in three different jurisdictions.
 
**2 On March 7, 2007, the respondent was admonished by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, Departmental Disciplinary Committee. The committee determined that the respondent had neglected the legal matters of three immigration clients.
 
On October 28, 2010, the respondent was censured by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department for neglecting immigration matters and engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on his fitness to practice law. The Hearing Panel had recommended a 3-month suspension.
 
On January 28, 2009, an informal admonition was sent to the respondent by the EOIR Disciplinary Counsel. With regard to six immigration cases, the respondent was found to have engaged in frivolous behavior in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(j) (2011) and to have recklessly made false statements in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(c).
 
Another informal admonition relating to four additional immigration clients was sent to the respondent by the EOIR Disciplinary Counsel on May 10, 2010. The respondent was found to have engaged in frivolous behavior in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(j), to have repeatedly failed to appear at scheduled hearings without good cause in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(l), and to have violated 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(c) by acting with reckless disregard in making false assertions.
 
*561 As previously noted, the Second Circuit suspended the respondent from practice for 3 months on October 14, 2010. The court adopted the August 5, 2009, Report and Recommendation of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Committee on Admissions and Grievances. This report found that the respondent displayed “a pattern of neglect of client matters, primarily through persistent disregard of briefing schedules.”
 
In its order, the Second Circuit stated that it found “the persistence of Salomon’s misconduct throughout the pendency of this disciplinary proceeding to be disturbing” and that suspension was “warranted by the magnitude of Salomon’s misconduct, the likelihood that a number of his clients were prejudiced, and his continued failure to abide by this Court’s scheduling orders.” The court accepted the Committee’s finding that the respondent had defaulted in approximately 125 cases out of 190 cases between 2005 and 2008.
 
On November 22, 2010, we reopened proceedings in a case involving one of the respondent’s clients. We found that the immigration client had “properly asserted her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel” and had presented “a substantial amount of evidence that [the respondent] failed to adduce relevant to the [client’s] claim.”
 
**3 The EOIR Disciplinary Counsel has presented evidence that the respondent also violated our November 23, 2010, immediate suspension order in this case. Specifically, the respondent signed a motion for a continuance before the Boston Immigration Court that contained a certificate of service dated December 13, 2010. The filing was rejected because the respondent had been suspended from practice. Although the respondent claims that he made a “ministerial error in referencing himself as counsel of record,” the evidence presented by the EOIR Disciplinary Counsel shows that the respondent did, indeed, violate the immediate suspension order.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that applying the proposed 6 months’ suspension would constitute a “grave injustice.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.103(b)(2)(iii) (2011); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.106(a). In support of his claim that the reciprocal discipline of 3 month’s suspension imposed by the Second Circuit should not be increased, the respondent suggests that we should be instructed by the fact that the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department censured him, rather than imposing greater discipline. In this regard, the respondent notes that he was represented and called witnesses before the First Judicial Department, while he appeared pro se before the Second Circuit. The respondent also points to the fact that the New York First Judicial Department recognized changes he had made to his practice.
 
In claiming grave injustice, the respondent argues that the cases the Government cited as presenting aggravating factors occurred in the past and were previously considered by either the New York First Judicial Department *562 or the Second Circuit in imposing his punishment. He claims that these were isolated incidents and that he has not repeated the same misconduct since the disciplinary actions against him were filed.
 
As mitigating factors, the respondent points to surgical procedures that he had undergone, which he claims affected his practice. However, the August 5, 2009, Report and Recommendation of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Committee on Admissions and Grievances found that the respondent’s medical problems were “at most a minor contributing factor to Salomon’s defaults.” The respondent also contends that his suspension will harm his law practice, and he claims that he has a family to support. However, as the EOIR Disciplinary Counsel argues, such hardships are not grounds for reducing a suspension. See Matter of Kronegold, 25 I&N Dec. 157, 162 (BIA 2010).
 
We agree with the EOIR Disciplinary Counsel’s assertion that the Board is in a unique position to review the respondent’s misconduct, which occurred in three jurisdictions. In making our determination, we have considered the respondent’s contention that he is a zealous advocate and performs a “great service” for his clients, many of whom are West African immigrants claiming persecution. We have also taken into account his statement that he “does not deny his misconduct as alleged.”
 
**4 Despite the respondent’s contentions, we find that the proposed nonidentical reciprocal discipline would not amount to a “grave injustice,” given his wide-ranging misconduct and the fact that he was disciplined in multiple jurisdictions. We have previously imposed such nonidentical reciprocal discipline in appropriate circumstances. Matter of Krivonos, 24 I&N Dec. 292, 293 (BIA 2007) (denying the reinstatement of a practitioner who had been reinstated to practice law by the courts but had engaged in fraud concerning immigration matters, because of the “serious nature of his crime”); Matter of Jean-Joseph, 24 I&N Dec. 294 (BIA 2007) (increasing reciprocal discipline based on the practitioner’s misconduct before the EOIR). We also find that nonidentical reciprocal discipline is warranted in this case.
 
ORDER: The EOIR Disciplinary Counsel’s motion for summary adjudication is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is suspended from practice before the Board, the Immigration Courts, and the DHS for a period of 6 months.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Since the respondent is currently under our November 23, 2010, order of suspension, his suspension will be deemed to have commenced on that date.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is instructed to maintain compliance with the directives set forth in our prior order and to notify the Board of any further disciplinary action against him.
 
*563 FURTHER ORDER: The respondent may petition this Board for reinstatement to practice before the Board, the Immigration Courts, and the DHS pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.107(a) (2011).
 
FURTHER ORDER: Because an immediate suspension order was previously imposed in this case, this order becomes effective immediately. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.105(d)(2); Matter of Kronegold, 25 I&N Dec. at 163.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening, rescission
 
This case was last before us on August 28, 2009, when we denied the respondent’s second motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him by an Immigration Judge on July 18, 2003. On February 11, 2011, the respondent filed a third motion to rescind the in absentia order. The respondent’s current motion is based on a claimed lack of notice, and the respondent asks that we grant the motion despite the fact that it is numerically barred because he has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered against him will be denied as numerically barred. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(i); 8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondent is a native of Trinidad and Tobago. In his motion, he contends that the attorneys who filed his prior motions to rescind in his case provided ineffective assistance and prevented him from obtaining reopening of his proceedings. The respondent acknowledges that his motion is numerically barred, but he asks this Board to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling or to consider his motion sua sponte given the circumstances of his case.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, has acknowledged the doctrine of equitable tolling but has recognized that, before an alien is entitled to have a deadline or a numerical limitation tolled, the alien must established that he or she acted diligently both in discovering the deception or fraud that led to the delay in filing and in pursing a remedy for the deception or fraud. See, e.g., Pafe v. Holder, 615 F.3d 967 (8th Cir. 2010); Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 864-66 (8th Cir. 2006). The respondent has not met this burden. Specifically, the respondent has not explained why, even though he admittedly suspected that the attorney who filed his first motion had not performed effectively (Exh. A to Memorandum of Law In Support of Motion, at 3), he did not seek out a new attorney for several years and did not file another motion to rescind until 4 years after we dismissed his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his first motion to rescind the in absentia order. We therefore cannot conclude that the respondent is entitled to equitable tolling of the numerical limit on motions to rescind in absentia orders.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening is warranted in his case. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that our discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases where exceptional circumstances are demonstrated). The respondent has not submitted evidence to suggest that he is prima facie eligible for any form of relief from removal. Moreover, there appear to be several factors in the respondent’s case that weigh against a favorable exercise of discretion. First, the information from the DHS indicates that the respondent has filed motions only after being apprehended, and the respondent has not offered evidence to counter these assertions or to establish that he has been diligent in pursuing his case. In addition, as we noted in our August 28, 2009, decision in the respondent’s case, the evidence the respondent has offered regarding his 2003 divorce raises questions regarding the nature and the validity of the marriage upon which he attempted to base an application for adjustment of status.
 
In light of these circumstances, and the other facts in the respondent’s case, we do not find that sua sponte reopening is warranted. We therefore deny the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered against him as numerically barred.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered against him is denied as numerically barred.

IN RE: JOSE ALVAREZ-FIERROS
File: AXXX XX7 919 - Memphis, TN

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tom Travis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William A. Lund
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 1, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) urges affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the motion by the DHS to pretermit his motion to suppress evidence because he did not file the motion by the court-imposed deadline. He asserts in his appeal brief, as he did in his response to the motion to pretermit, that his failure to timely submit his motion to suppress was due to a “paperwork blunder” by his attorney, and that the Immigration Judge should have accepted the late-filed motion.
 
The record reflects that on December 15, 2009, the Immigration Judge directed that the motion be suppress be filed by March 5, 2010 (Tr. at 3). The Immigration Judge imposed the deadline after the respondent’s counsel stated that he could file the motion by the March 5, 2010, date (Tr. at 3). The record further reflects that before the conclusion of the hearing on December 15, 2009, counsel confirmed with the Immigration Judge that the motion was due on March 5, 2010 (Tr. at 4-5). Given that the respondent had almost 3 months to submit his motion and the only reason stated for his failure to file by the court-imposed deadline was attorney error, we do not find that the Immigration Judge erred in denying an extension of time or in ruling that the respondent had waived his opportunity to file a motion to suppress. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (an Immigration Judge may grant a continuance for “good cause”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (“If an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that document shall be deemed waived.”).
 
If the respondent is seeking to assert that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to submit his motion to suppress by the court-imposed deadline, he failed to comply with any of the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cynthia A. Irvine, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
212(a)(2)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(B)º - Multiple criminal convictions
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 29, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Ukraine who adjusted his status to that of lawful permanent resident in 1998 pursuant to section 209(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1159(a). On return from a temporary visit abroad in 2007, the respondent was served with a Notice to Appear charging him as an arriving alien who is inadmissible based on his multiple criminal convictions for which he was sentenced to more than 5 years imprisonment. See sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (B).
 
On September 15, 2009, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed due to his failure to timely file documents and to cooperate. The respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He blamed former counsel for missing the filing deadlines and for failing to timely inform him of the Immigration Judge’s removal order. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
On December 29, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion. He concluded, inter alia, that former counsel’s response to the DHS that “he would respond to the allegations when he was free to do so” meant that he intended to challenge the allegations that he provided ineffective assistance (I.J. Dec. 29, 2009, decision at 1). The Immigration Judge reiterated his finding that the respondent failed to comply with the filing deadlines and was generally uncooperative.
 
On our de novo review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. He did not evaluate the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to the Lozada requirements. We find the Immigration Judge’s factual finding that former counsel wanted to challenge the allegations, but could not, to be clearly erroneous. There was nothing to prevent former counsel from challenging the respondent’s allegations. Indeed, one of the reasons for the requirement that former counsel be informed of the allegations leveled against him is to give him the opportunity to defend himself. To date, former counsel has not responded to the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance.
 
*2 The respondent substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. In doing so, he demonstrated that former counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence and he that was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that prejudice is established when counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
We recognize that the Immigration Judge gave the respondent opportunities to apply for adjustment of status before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)¿FN1º and to modify his criminal sentences so that he could establish his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), before the Immigration Judge.¿FN2º See generally Matter of Abosi, 24 I&N Dec. 204 (BIA 2007) (returning lawful permanent resident can apply for a 212(h) waiver without readjusting). Based on the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The September 15, 2009 and December 29, 2009, decisions of the Immigration Judge are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

The Immigration Judge acknowledged that he was without jurisdiction to adjudicate the respondent’s adjustment application (I.J. September 15, 2009, decision at 2). He was simply affording the respondent the time and opportunity to apply before USCIS. See generally Matter of Silitonga, 25 I&N Dec. 89 (BIA 2009). This may have confused the respondent who was eligible to apply before the Immigration Judge for a 212(h) waiver without an adjustment application. See Matter of Abosi, supra.

Although the Immigration Judge seems to state otherwise, section 212(h) of the Act can waive an alien’s inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(B) of the Act (I.J. September 15, 2009, decision at 2).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Courtney Smith, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 11, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
In March 24, 2010, the respondent was convicted of Criminal Sale of a Controlled Substance (Cocaine) in the Third Degree, in violation of New York law. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exh. 3. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). Cf. Francis v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 131, 141-43 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction. See Tr. at 20-21. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). Cf. Roman v. Mukasey, 553 F.3d 184, 187 (2d Cir. 2009). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable for having a controlled substance violation. See Exh. 1; I.J. at 4,7-8.¿FN1º The respondent ultimately requested no relief, and the Immigration Judge concluded he was ineligible for relief. See I.J. at 6-8; Tr. at 52-53, 61-62. The respondent only requested a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S._, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).¿FN2º However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
*2 An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).¿FN3º We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996) This Board and the federal courts have consistently held that an alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of his or her otherwise valid state or federal criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir. 1993); Matter of Ponce De Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; AG 1997); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974). Neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board has the authority to look beyond the record of conviction to determine the guilt or innocence of an alien in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Reyes, 20 I&N Dec. 789 (BIA 1994); Matter of Fortis, supra. Rather, such collateral attacks must be addressed to the appropriate criminal court.
 
The post-conviction motion does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Madrigal supra. The conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992) See also Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 216-17 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1985); Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-93 (2d Cir. 1976).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge made no finding concerning the charge that he is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony relating to illicit trafficking in a controlled substance. See Exh. 1; I.J. at 4,7-8. The respondent argues on appeal that the respondent was not convicted of an aggravated felony. However, because the Immigration Judge did not make a finding on the issue, we will not address it.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in his deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates his right to counsel.

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christina J. Murdoch, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra S. Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On February 7, 2011, the respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings in order to afford him the opportunity to seek adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (Respondent’s Motion at 2). He also filed supplementary evidence on February 15, 2011, and April 20, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security is opposed to the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
Even though it appeared that the respondent was statutorily eligible for adjustment of status on the basis of an approved immigrant petition filed by his United States citizen mother, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for relief as a matter of discretion (I.J. at 6-10). On November 9, 2010, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s application as a matter of discretion.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior attorneys. He has also presented evidence that he has recently married a citizen of the United States and is the beneficiary of an immigrant petition filed by his wife, which, if approved, could potentially serve as a second basis for adjustment of status (Respondent’s Motion at Tab 21).
 
To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent must show that prior his attorney was both ineffective and that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s performance. Toure v. Holder, 624 F.3d 422, 430 (7th Cir. 2010). Likewise, to prevail on a motion to reopen on the basis of new evidence, the respondent must establish that adjustment of status would be merited as a matter of discretion. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). A motion to reopen wherein an alien requests a discretionary form of relief may also be denied as a matter of discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (2011); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 105 (1988).
 
With regards to the issue of whether the respondent merits adjustment of status as a matter of discretion, the respondent has presented affidavits from himself, his spouse, his brother, and his two sisters (Respondent’s Motion at Tabs 11-15).¿FN1º He has also presented evidence concerning his mother’s health, the bona fides of his recent marriage, his spouse’s health, and his value to the community (Respondent’s Motion at Tabs 16-17, 21-40).¿FN2º The evidence indicates that the respondent’s mother suffers from hypertension, high cholesterol, atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and poor eye sight, and is unable to live independently. Likewise, the respondent’s wife became disabled in 2004 and receives Social Security benefits.
 
*2 We acknowledge the respondent’s positive equities. The respondent’s strong family ties to this country, his entrepreneurship, apparent stable employment, and the lengthy period of time that he resided in this country are all strong equities which favor granting him adjustment of status.
 
We do not dispute the respondent’s contention that his removal would result in significant hardship to his mother and spouse (Respondent’s Motion at 18-21). Throughout the respondent’s motion and supporting evidence, he reiterates that he is his mother’s primary caretaker and is in the best position to take care of his mother. Although the new medical evidence relating to the respondent’s mother is perhaps more detailed, it is essentially cumulative to the testimony and documents previously considered by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 3-4; Exh. 3-D at 40; Tr. at 23). The respondent does have three other siblings in the United States who could potentially assist his mother, to some degree, upon the respondent’s return to Peru. Alternatively, the respondent’s mother could accompany the respondent to Peru. Even though the respondent’s wife also has medical needs and relies on the respondent for support, the weight given to any hardship that would follow the respondent’s removal is diminished as the parties married after the commencement of proceedings. See Matter of Mendez-Moralez, 21 I&N Dec. 296, 302 (BIA 1996).
 
However, we cannot ignore the respondent’s lengthy and serious criminal history. Since entering the United States unlawfully in 1993, the respondent has been convicted on four occasions for battery (one of which was for substantial battery), convicted on three occasions for operating while intoxicated, and has sustained additional convictions for resisting or obstructing an officer, disorderly conduct, intimidation of a victim, bail jumping, and operating after revocation (I.J. at 7-9; Exh. 2). The Individual History Report from the Dane County Sheriff’s Office indicates that the respondent has been arrested or cited on more than 20 occasions for criminal offenses or probation violations (Exh. 3-B). According to the October 2009 report, the respondent was most recently arrested for simple battery in February 2009 (Exh. 3-B at 34). Additionally, the letter from attorney Juan J. Mendoza in response to the respondent’s bar complaint against him, which the respondent does not dispute, indicates that the respondent has recently entered a guilty plea to a new criminal offense. We fully agree with the Immigration Judge’s assessment that there are no assurances that the respondent would remain in the United States problem-free.
 
Considering the evidence presented with his motion to reopen as well as the evidence previously presented before the Immigration Judge, the respondent has not presented factors that outweigh his significant criminal history. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that adjustment of status, an extraordinary form of relief that was not designed to supersede the regular consular process of visa issuance abroad, is merited as a matter of discretion. See Matter of Blas, 15 I&N Dec. 626, 630 (BIA 1974; A.G. 1976) (“¿Tºhe extraordinary discretionary relief provided in section 245 of the Act can only be granted in meritorious cases, and that the burden is always upon the alien to establish that his application for that relief merits favorable consideration”); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970).
 
*3 Accordingly, as the respondent has not established that his application for relief would be granted in any event, he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsels’ alleged ineffective of assistance or that his motion should be granted in light of new evidence. Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion should be granted as a matter of the Board’s discretion. His motion, therefore, will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent has also resubmitted additional evidence which was previously contained in the record or evidence relating to his state bar complaints against his prior attorneys (Respondent’s Motion at Tabs 1-10, 18-20).

Even though the respondent has now presented additional evidence, the Immigration Judge previously considered the respondent’s mother’s medical needs in his decision (I.J. at 5).

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in this case on October 23, 2006, and on May 20, 2009, the Board denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen the proceedings. On November 1, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen which the Department of Homeland Security opposes. The motion is untimely and number-barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status. He seeks to toll the filing restrictions imposed on this motion based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorney who previously represented him before the Immigration Judge and the Board. The respondent, however, has failed to show that he has acted with the due diligence in bringing this motion before the Board. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124, 127 (2nd Cir. 2000) (holding that the filing deadline for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled if the alien exhibits due diligence in pursuing his claim).
 
In order to equitably toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll, including both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. See Cekic v. I.N.S., 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2nd Cir. 2006); see also Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2nd Cir. 2008). The respondent filed the instant motion more than 17 months after our prior order. The respondent has not explained the delay in bringing this motion, or otherwise explained when he discovered the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
As we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in this matter, equitable tolling of the filing restrictions imposed on the respondent’s motion to reopen is not warranted in this case. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The following order denying the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chandler B. Sharma, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley Fortson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s August 28, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen the decision dated April 8, 2009, which granted him pre-conclusion voluntary departure. The respondent also moves that the Board sua sponte reopen the proceedings and stay the order of removal. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2011). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen was not timely filed (I.J. at 2). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (“¿aº motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion”). We further agree that the respondent did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of his prior counsel such that his case should be reopened. Even if the respondent met the procedural requirements for claiming ineffective assistance, described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not established error or prejudice. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (“¿Iºn addition to substantial, if not exact, compliance with the procedural requirements of Lozada, a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel … must also show prejudice.”). Prejudice exists “when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” Id. (citation omitted).
 
The respondent argues that his prior attorney, Mr. Joseph Turner, inadequately presented his due process concerns to the Immigration Judge, regarding the automatic revocation of the visa petition filed by his mother on his behalf (Respondent’s Br. at 8, 18). Jurisdiction over the visa petition, however, rests with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the respondent acknowledges that Mr. Turner filed a petition for review of the revocation with USCIS. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Mr. Turner ineffectively presented the respondent’s case to the Immigration Judge. Rather, Mr. Turner’s response to the respondent’s complaint indicates that his request for voluntary departure was a strategic decision, in order to await adjudication of the petition by USCIS (Respondent’s Br., Exh. XIV). Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds for reopening. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998). While the respondent continues to assert that his visa petition was wrongly revoked, neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board has the authority to review the revocation or grant the newly-filed visa petition. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice.
 
*2 We also concur with the Immigration Judge’s determination that this case does not present exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening sua sponte (I.J. at 3). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Finally, we deny the respondent’s motion for the Board to sua sponte reopen the Immigration Judge’s decision. In accordance with our analysis above, we also deny the request to stay proceedings. The following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and the motion is denied.

The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 6, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Initially, we note that although the respondent indicated in his Notice of Appeal that he intended to file a brief with this Board and was later granted a briefing extension, we have not received a brief from the respondent. Therefore, we will address the arguments raised in the Notice of Appeal.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(h).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in pretermitting the respondent’s request for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). In a decision dated August 4, 2010, another Immigration Judge pretermitted the respondent’s application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
We affirm the finding that the respondent is ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. The respondent was charged and found removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony, specifically a crime of violence under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act (Exh. 1). Pursuant to Matter of Brieva, 23 I&N Dec. 766 (BIA 2005), an alien who is removable on the basis of his conviction for a crime of violence is ineligible for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act, because the aggravated felony ground of removal with which he was charged has no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act.¿FN1º The respondent is thus ineligible to apply for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge’s denial of former section 212(c) of the Act based on a lack of comparable ground in the removability context violates equal protection under the Constitution. We will not address the respondent’s equal protection argument because we lack jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the Act. See Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Lastly, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to continue to pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his Texas murder case. The respondent was convicted of murder in Texas in 1989 and sentenced to 50 years of imprisonment (Exh. 2). The respondent claims that he was not properly advised of the immigration consequences of his plea. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010) (holding that a conviction is constitutionally deficient if counsel fails to advise a defendant of the potential immigration consequences of entering a guilty plea). However, the respondent has presented no evidence with his appeal to show that an attack on his conviction has resulted in vacatur or that such attack has even been filed. The respondent’s mere speculation or assertion that his conviction might be invalid does not change the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes, and the conviction remains a valid basis for his removal unless and until it is overturned. See generally Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 19, 2010, denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii) (2010).
 
Upon our de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened. There is no issue regarding whether the respondent received notice of his December 2, 2009, hearing, as the record shows that he was personally served with a notice indicating the time and date of the hearing (I.J. at 2; Exh. 7). Rather, the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances, namely his reliance on the erroneous advice of an immigration consultant, prevented him from appearing at his scheduled hearing. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(5)(C)(i). He asserts that, despite being warned against doing so by the Immigration Judge, he hired an immigration consultant to “close” his case. The respondent does not claim that the consultant held herself out to be an attorney, nor does the respondent claim that he believed the consultant to be an attorney. The Ninth Circuit has held that reliance upon the advice of an immigration consultant — who the alien knew was not an attorney and who was not the actual or purported agent or assistant of an attorney — does not qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” under the rubric of ineffective assistance of counsel under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. See Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014, 1020 (9th Cir. 2008); Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943, 946-47 (9th Cir. 1999). We therefore find that the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear.
 
For the reasons above, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bernard Rosenbloom, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorely Ramirez Mravetz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 15, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).¿FN1º However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). This Board and the federal courts have consistently held that an alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of his or her otherwise valid state or federal criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir. 1993); Matter of Ponce De Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; AG 1997); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974). Neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board has the authority to look beyond the record of conviction to determine the guilt or innocence of an alien in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Reyes, 20 I&N Dec. 789 (BIA 1994); Matter of Fortis, supra. Rather, such collateral attacks must be addressed to the appropriate criminal court.
 
*2 The post-conviction motion does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Madrigal, supra. The conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). See also Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 216-17 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1985).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s December 10, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which is denied.
 
The respondent asserts that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by conceding the aggravated felony charge, rather than challenging the same (Motion at 4). The respondent has largely complied with the procedural requirements for such a claim. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, he has not submitted any evidence as to his representational agreement with former counsel, nor shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s actions, as required. Id.
 
In this regard we observe that the evidence before the Immigration Judge reflects that the respondent was convicted of “sale of marijuana” in violation of Florida State Statute 893.13, a third degree felony offense. Although the particular subsection of the statute was not provided, a review of the statute reflects that section 893.13(1)(a)(2) prohibits the sale of certain controlled substances, the offense of which constitutes a felony in the third degree.¿FN1º The respondent’s offense therefore is a controlled substance violation which qualifies as an aggravated felony offense because it is comparable to the federal crime of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. See Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 49, 53-57 (2006) (a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), if the offense would be punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.); 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (making distribution of marijuana unlawful); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) (a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) is a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to five years).
 
Therefore, as the respondent was properly found removable as charged, the attorney’s concession to this fact did not serve to prejudice the respondent. The respondent provided supplemental evidence to his motion reflecting that a motion for post-conviction relief relating to one of his 1995 convictions, which are not at issue, was granted. This fact does not render the respondent eligible for relief from removal. However, it does call into question which conviction he retained former counsel to file a motion for post-conviction relief against. As there is no clear evidence regarding their representation agreement, we are unable to ascertain if it was the 1995 conviction, or the conviction forming the basis for the charge of removability. Moreover, there is no evidence that any motion for post-conviction relief against the conviction at issue had any basis in law or fact. Rather, it is unclear on what basis any such motion would have been predicated. Therefore, we find that the respondent has not met his “heavy burden” of demonstrating that reopening is warranted based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (holding that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Therefore, the following order shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent has cited no support for his assertion that the sale of a controlled substance under Florida law “may be defined broadly to include “merely offering to ¿sellº” (Motion at 7). As such, his arguments in this regard are unavailing.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kelly Ryan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathy Giraitis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 8, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent entered the United States without inspection on September 16, 1997. On August 10, 2007, the respondent was convicted of Stalking - Emotional Distress. The respondent admitted the conviction. See Tr. at 29. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). The Immigration Judge found respondent removable for being present in the United States without authorization and for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. See I.J. at 2; Exh. 1.
 
The respondent indicated on December 28, 2010, his intent to file a U visa petition. See Tr. at 30. The respondent was thereafter granted two continuances. However, as of February 8, 2011, when the case was scheduled for final hearing, the respondent had not yet filed the U visa petition. See Tr. at 38. At that hearing, the respondent requested no other relief. See Tr. at 39-41.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. Even assuming that the respondent expressly requested a continuance (which is not reflected in the record), we find that the respondent failed to show good cause for the continuance. The respondent had been granted two prior continuances, giving him more than a month to file the U visa petition, but he had not even filed the U visa petition at the time of the final hearing.
 
*2 Also on appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to advise the respondent of eligibility to apply for voluntary departure. We note that the respondent was represented by counsel between the December 28, 2010, hearing, and the February 8, 2011, hearing. However, the respondent, through present counsel, does not assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent may bring a motion to reopen if he believes he suffered prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s ineffectiveness. However, he must comply with the prerequisites for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998); Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine E. Halliday-Roberts
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.
 
The Board issued a final order in this case on January 19, 2010. An untimely motion to reopen was filed with the Board on September 13, 2010. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, which determined that the respondent was subject to removal as an alien convicted of a controlled substances violation, under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, and found him ineligible for relief from removal. Specifically, as the respondent was previously granted cancellation of removal under section 240 A(a) of the Act, he was ineligible for that form of relief. Section 240A(c)(6) of the Act.
 
The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from an attorney, Katherine Owen, who did not appear at the removal hearing, despite entering her appearance on the respondent’s behalf. Respondent’s Mot.; I.J. at 1.
 
The respondent’s claim against the attorney could have been raised to the Board, as the respondent appeared as pro se on appeal. Moreover, the respondent could have, but did not, file a timely motion to reopen with the Board. DHS Opp.
 
The respondent also does not explain how the result reached might have been any different, had he been represented by counsel at the removal hearing. A respondent “must also show substantial prejudice by demonstrating that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id. See also Zetino v. Holder, 622 F.3d 1007, 1013 (9th Cir. 2010)(a showing of prejudice concerning an alleged due process violation “… means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation”)(citation omitted); Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365, 373 (9th Cir. 2010)(citation omitted)(same). The respondent does not make that showing in this case.
 
The respondent also fails to meet the procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). DHS Opp.
 
The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The pending motion is denied.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Claire H. Kim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christie Woo-Thibodeaux
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative order in this matter was entered on December 27, 2006. This matter was last before the Board on October 3, 2008, when we denied the respondents’ motion to reopen proceedings. On September 27, 2010, the respondents filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Like the respondents’ last motion to reopen, the one before us is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final order of removal. The current motion is also number-barred. The respondents now contend, however, that they have discovered that they received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the time limit on their motion should be equitably tolled.
 
The respondents assert that the attorney who filed the lead respondent’s visa petition, Robert Sklar, provided ineffective assistance that caused the visa petition to be revoked and that led to the respondents being placed in proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). They assert that they just learned of the ineffectiveness because the files showing the ineffectiveness were previously seized in a government raid. The specific ineffectiveness, they contend, was Robert Sklar’s failure to respond to the Notice of Intent to Revoke and request for evidence sent to CKM Industries, where the lead respondent worked.
 
The respondents have not shown that proceedings should be reopened in this matter. As correctly observed by the DHS, the alleged ineffectiveness involved actions that occurred before the respondents were placed in proceedings, not actions that occurred during proceedings. The respondents were not represented by Robert Sklar during their removal proceedings and the respondents have not shown that their removal proceedings were unfair. See Lara-Torres v. Gonzales, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004). Also, the respondents have not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada’s procedural requirements for ineffective assistance claims.
 
*2 Furthermore, the Notice of Intent to Revoke and request for evidence was not sent to Robert Sklar, and there is no reason to believe that he even knew of it. The Notice of Intent to Revoke was sent to Michael Yuhan, Vice President of CKM Industries, Inc. It was sent because Robert Sklar had previously committed fraud by obtaining labor certifications from the Department of Labor without the knowledge of the employers listed on the applications. According to the Notice of Intent to Revoke, Sklar forged the signatures of various employers and claimed that he was their representative. Robert Sklar also forged signatures on immigrant petitions. The vice president of CKM Industries was contacted by the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) for additional evidence so that the INS could determine whether the respondent’s employment based visa petition was part of the fraud. The Notice of Intent to Revoke stated that unless certain evidence were received from CKM, the INS (now the DHS) could only determine that the labor certification application and the immigrant petition for the respondent were filed without the employer’s knowledge or authorization, with no desire or intent to employ the beneficiary.
 
Robert Sklar would not have been the appropriate person to respond to the Notice of Intent to Revoke, even if he knew about it. Furthermore, the respondents do not assert in their motion that the vice president of CKM Industries, or another officer at CKM Industries, responded to the Notice.¿FN1º While there is evidence in the record that Robert Sklar committed fraud, there is not evidence that he provided the respondents with ineffective assistance of counsel. Given that the respondents have not demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel, they have not established that equitable tolling should apply to their motion based on their recent discovery of the alleged ineffectiveness.
 
The respondents have also not shown that sua sponte reopening is appropriate. Even if proceedings were reopened, they have not demonstrated eligibility for relief. The respondents assert that the lead respondent actually worked for CKM Industries, that the applications filed with respect to his case were all legitimate and that just because Robert Sklar filed fraudulent documents, it should not be assumed that everything filed by Robert Sklar was fraudulent. However, assuming the truth of the respondents’ allegations, the respondents have not shown that they have visas available to them. Accordingly, there is no basis for reopening for a hearing on their adjustment eligibility.
 
The respondents also assert that there is no DHS regulatory process for invalidating a labor certification that has been approved, as opposed to one that is pending. The respondents contend that because the labor certificate in this case is valid, having not been properly revoked, its “revocation” cannot serve as the basis for the revocation of the Form I-140 petition. We find no merit, however, to the respondents’ argument that 20 C.F.R. § 656.30(d) is not sufficient, without additional DHS regulations, to allow for the DHS invalidation of a labor certificate and subsequent invalidation of the 1-140 petition.
 
*3 To the extent the respondents seek equitable relief they must pursue that with the DHS. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). This Board has no power to grant equitable remedies or to confer general humanitarian relief on aliens, even though a particular case may pose sympathetic circumstances. The respondents’ untimely-filed motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barry C. Schneps, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eileen McCrohan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on July 15, 2010, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s June 1, 2009, decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). On September 1, 2010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen to apply for asylum in the first instance and to reapply for cancellation of removal. On November 1, 2010, the respondent submitted additional evidence in support of his motion (“Respondent’s Supporting Evidence”). For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material” and “must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing ….” Id. Further, the movant must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94,104-05 (1988); and satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case, Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
As an initial matter, we find the respondent’s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceedings below to be without any merit (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attorney Affirmation). The respondent has not specified how his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Also, statements from his current counsel in a mixed legal and factual affirmation do not qualify as evidence (see id.). See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183,188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Finally, the respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada¿FN1º procedural requirements. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must comply with the Lozada requirements). We next address the respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue asylum.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue asylum will be denied. First, the respondent has not submitted the requisite asylum application. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Second, the respondent has not demonstrated that the information in his written statement regarding his alleged political activity and mistreatment in Nigeria in the 1990’s was unavailable or undiscoverable for his former hearing on June 1,2009 (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Statement of Asylum). Although the respondent alleges that members of his political party are still mistreated and he is on a “radar” list (id, Statement of Asylum at 1, 4), he has not demonstrated that this is a material change in circumstances since his former hearing on June 1, 2009.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen to reapply for cancellation of removal will also be denied. The respondent has not demonstrated that the Certification of Health Care Provider, dated February 23, 2009, and the doctor’s notes and letter from 2008 and May 1,2009, respectively, were unavailable at his former hearing on June 1, 2009 (see Respondent’s Supporting Evidence, Tab 2). In fact, the respondent submitted the same May 1, 2009, letter from Dr. Lori Berman regarding his daughter’s asthma during the former proceedings (compare id. with Group Exh. 14, Tab D). Further, the background documents regarding environmental conditions in Nigeria were previously available and were actually submitted by the respondent at the former hearing (compare Respondent’s Supporting Evidence, Tab 4 with Group Exh. 14, Tabs I-K).
 
The respondent has also not demonstrated that the information contained in the IYAHO Service Plan was unavailable at the former hearing or represents a material change in his daughter’s condition (see Respondent’s Supporting Evidence, Tab 3). In any event, we give the observations and conclusions in this plan limited weight because we do not know (a) the qualifications of the individuals preparing the plan, and (b) the basis for their observations and conclusions regarding the respondent’s daughter’s condition, including the number of interviews conducted with the respondent’s daughter (see id.).
 
Finally, although not explicitly requested, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte to pursue an application for asylum or cancellation of removal. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999).
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay is denied.

IN RE: HAMILTON S. MARTINEZ-ARGUETA A.K.A. HAMILTON STANLEY MARTINEZ ARGUETA A.K.A. HAMILTON ARGUETA
File: AXXX XX7 743 - Los Angeles, CA
April 26, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert G. Berke, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s January 28, 2011, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The Board denied his request for a stay of removal on March 6, 2011. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion avers that he paid an attorney, Sung U. Park, to provide him representation with regard to his first motion to reopen, and ensuing appeal, although both reflect that they were filed pro se. The motion is supported by a sworn declaration by respondent’s current counsel, who suggests that Attorney Park may have been providing “limited scope” representation of the respondent. Counsel states that, as such, he will not file a complaint with the state bar authorities until he has “received some communication from Mr. Park explaining his position” (Motion at 17). Counsel also states that while he has not notified Mr. Park of his “intent to file” the instant motion, he would do so “forthwith.”
 
We do not find that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, nor is there clear ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). It is settled law that statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Similarly, statements in a motion are not evidence. Id.; see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984). The motion has also not been supported by a statement from the respondent. As such, the motion is not supported by competent evidence of the facts alleged therein with regard to any alleged ineffective assistance by Mr. Park. Further, there is no evidence that Mr. Park has been informed of the significant allegations against him. These allegations include the assertion that Mr. Park wrote a “motion for late filing of Notice of Appeal” on behalf of the respondent falsely representing that the respondent was proceeding completely pro se, was ignorant of the deadline and requirements for the filing of an appeal as he was unrepresented, and was, in fact, then trying to obtain counsel (Motion at 10).
 
Present counsel has not adequately demonstrated whether a bar complaint has been filed and, if so, on what basis. Moreover, he has not provided a sufficient explanation for not ensuring that a complaint has been filed detailing the serious ethical breaches alleged against Mr. Park. According to the motion, the respondent believed that he was being fully represented by Mr. Park, rather than receiving some form of limited scope representation as present counsel now suggests. While one of the photocopied receipts from Mr. Park reflects that the respondent had paid for a “pro se ¿motion toº reopen,” the only other receipt with a memorandum indicates that the payment was for preparation of the respondent’s asylum claim and a court hearing on April 2, 2010. Although not mentioned in the motion, on that same date, the Immigration Judge not only issued an in absentia order of removal, but also issued an order granting a motion to withdraw as respondent’s counsel proffered by Mr. Park. Given that the respondent has not submitted any statement in support of the motion, must less submitted an affidavit “setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard,” as required, we decline to speculate as to the basis for Mr. Park’s withdrawal, or to what services the receipts relate. Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 As noted, it does not appear that the respondent believed Mr. Park’s representation of him was “limited.” Absent evidence of notification of this claim to Mr. Park, and the filing of a bar complaint in this regard, counsel’s unsupported speculation in this regard is insufficient to support reopening. While present counsel has expressed a “belief” that the respondent’s family has “communicated with the state bar regarding this matter,” he has not explained this statement, nor provided any evidence in this regard (Motion at 13). Since the time of the filing of the present motion, no further evidence has been submitted evidencing any communication with Mr. Park regarding this claim, and/or that an appropriate bar complaint has been filed.
 
In sum, as the respondent has not satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jackie Bliss Kammerman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam L. Berg
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 This case was last before us on January 28, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 27, 2010, decision. On February 4, 2011, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes. The respondent separately requests reopening for further consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for a waiver under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted evidence that the General District Court of Loudoun County, Virginia, granted his petition for writ of error coram nobis and vacated his April 5, 2005, conviction for petit larceny. The Court vacated the respondent’s conviction because it found, inter alia, that the respondent had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The DHS opposes the motion stating that this decision is not final because the Commonwealth Attorney has filed a timely appeal of right with the Circuit Court for Loudoun County, and thus the respondent’s conviction remains final. The DHS also states that it has stayed removal of the respondent pending the outcome in the Circuit Court, or action by the Board. We agree with the DHS that the respondent’s conviction remains final at present for Immigration purposes.
 
However, without expressing an ultimate opinion on the issue, given the intervening federal court and Board case law, and considering the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Aremu v. DHS, 450 F.3d 578 (4th Cir. 2006), we reopen and remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge for further evidence and argument regarding the respondent’s eligibility for a section 212(h) waiver and for the entry of a new decision thereafter.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael Brennan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 14, 2010. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On December 22, 2009, the respondent was convicted of Possession of a Controlled Substance (Cocaine) with Intent to Sell, in violation of New Hampshire law. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exh. 2. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction. See Tr. at 54-55. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved and found him removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation and an aggravated felony relating to illicit trafficking in a controlled substance. See I.J. 2; Exh. 1.
 
The respondent expressed no fear of return to Mexico and requested no relief from removal. See Tr. at 56-57. The Immigration Judge concluded he was ineligible for relief. See I.J. at 2.
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).¿FN1º The respondent has offered evidence of that with the appeal. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
*2 While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. Though the respondent has filed a post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction, it does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). See also Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 216-17 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1985); Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-93 (2d Cir. 1976).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Javier F. Pico, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Turkey, and a citizen of Jordan, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 3, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal convictions.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On May 7, 2010, and on December 16, 2008, the respondent was convicted of Larceny over $250, in violation of Massachusetts law. On September 26, 2008, the respondent was convicted of Drug Possession (Klonopin), in violation of Massachusetts law. A record of each of these convictions was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exhs. 2-4. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). In addition, the respondent admitted the convictions. See Exh. 6. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c).
 
The respondent, through counsel, conceded removability for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct and a controlled substance violation. See Exh. 1. Consequently, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. See I.J. at 1.
 
The respondent requested no relief from removal, and the Immigration Judge concluded he was ineligible for relief. See Tr. at 21. The respondent requested continuances of his removal hearing to enable him to pursue a motion to vacate his convictions. Though the Immigration Judge granted two continuances, further continuances were denied. See Tr. at 10-15, 17-18, 20-21.
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the convictions, which serve as the basis for removal, and which render him ineligible for relief from removal, are being challenged before the criminal courts pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).¿FN1º The respondent has offered evidence of that with the appeal. However, only one of the three convictions has been vacated.
 
*2 On appeal, the applicant argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him another continuance. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. We conclude that good cause was not shown. While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motions, such motions do not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. Though the respondent has filed post-conviction motions to vacate the convictions, it does not render the convictions non-final. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The convictions became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal them. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). See also Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 216-17 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1985); Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-93 (2d Cir. 1976).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose W. Vega, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 8, 2010, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand, which was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. On January 6, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions not applicable here, a motion to reopen must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed approximately 6 months after the Board’s final decision, and the motion is therefore time-barred.
 
Although the respondent requests the Board to reopen sua sponte, our discretion in that regard is limited to cases in which an exceptional situation is demonstrated. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). No such exceptional situation has been demonstrated. The respondent’s last motion was denied because the respondent had not complied with the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent did not include evidence that a grievance had been filed against his former attorney. Additionally, although the respondent claimed that he sought to apply for cancellation of removal and withholding of removal, he did not submit the applications for relief with his motion. Thus, he did not establish prejudice from his former attorney’s failure to timely file those applications with the Immigration Judge. See id. at 640.
 
The respondent asserts in his current motion that he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal, but he still has not submitted an application. Thus, he still has not established prejudice. Furthermore, the applicable regulation provides that a motion to reopen to apply for relief must include the application and the supporting evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has also still not established that he filed a bar complaint against his former counsel.
 
In light of the factors noted above, the respondent has not shown that sua sponte reopening is warranted. His untimely-filed motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of this motion is moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Susanna Dvortsin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on October 13, 2010, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s December 9, 2009, decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal. On January 5, 2011, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen with the Board requesting an opportunity to adjust her status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material” and “must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing ….” Id. Further, the movant must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988); and satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case, Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. First, the respondent has not submitted the requisite adjustment of status application. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Second, some of the respondent’s evidence, specifically, the notice of the approved I-130 petition and her brother’s certificate of naturalization, was previously available and, in fact, was submitted at her former hearing (compare Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tabs 1-2 with Group Exhibit 2, Tab A). Third, the respondent has not demonstrated her prima facie eligibility to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act because she has not submitted evidence that an immigrant visa is immediately available. See section 245(i)(2)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(b)(2). The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. According to the most recent Visa Bulletin of the State Department, the respondent’s priority date, April 11,2001, is later than the date listed for the Fourth Preference (F4) (brothers and sisters of adult citizens) in the Visa Bulletin, February 1, 1996. See Department of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. IX, No. 31 (Apr. 2011). Consequently, an immigrant visa is not immediately available to the respondent.¿FN1º

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Randall L. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Immigration Judge entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on May 7, 2002, when he denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, but granted voluntary departure and entered an alternate order of removal to Cameroon. More than 8 years later, on May 17, 2010, the respondent filed the present motion to reopen, which is both untimely and number-barred.¿FN1º See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion was not filed within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s final order of removal, and the respondent filed a motion to reopen in May 2002, which was denied. We affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of that motion in May 2003, and subsequently denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider that decision in July 2003. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the current motion.
 
The respondent urges that the time and number limits for this motion should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Mr. Patrick Tzeuton, an attorney who was disbarred in October 2009 and was convicted of conspiracy to prepare false asylum applications, immigration fraud, and obstruction of official immigration proceedings in February 2009 (Motion, tabs F-G). The respondent claims that Mr. Tzeuton’s co-counsel wrongly informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent was the beneficiary of an approved immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) (Motion at 3, 11, tab B). The respondent asserts that Mr. Tzeuton erroneously filed an adjustment of status application based on that petition, which had been withdrawn, and failed to inform the Immigration Judge and the Board that the respondent was actually the beneficiary of an approved family-based fourth-preference visa petition (Motion at 3-4, 9-10). The respondent also argues that Mr. Tzeuton did not inform him of the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure, did not inform him of the Board’s decisions, and failed to reschedule an interview for the respondent and his ex-wife with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (Motion at 10-11, tab B).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has yet to determine whether the Board has the power to excuse an untimely, number-barred motion based on equitable tolling. Nonetheless, the Fourth Circuit has suggested that, even if the concept of equitable tolling were to apply, it is unavailable to a party who has failed to exercise diligence and demonstrate prejudice from the prior attorney’s actions. See Amegashie v. Gonzales, 188 F. App’x 226 (4th Cir. 2006); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent did not exercise due diligence such that equitable tolling should be found to excuse this untimely, number-barred motion. Although the respondent argues that he did not “fully understand what happened” during his hearing before the Immigration Judge and was not kept fully informed of the subsequent status of the motion filed by his prior attorney, the Board’s July 2003 decision was mailed directly to the respondent, and he has not provided a persuasive explanation for his delay of over 6 years before seeking new counsel¿FN2º and filing a motion raising his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Motion at 4, 7-8, tab B).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown prejudice from his prior attorney’s actions. The respondent’s potential eligibility for adjustment of status did not arise until January 2008, when a visa number became available in the fourth-preference visa category. See Department of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. VIII, No. 114 (Jan. 2008). Because the visa petition approved on the respondent’s behalf did not confer an immediately available visa upon him, the respondent has not established prejudice from his prior counsel’s misstatement to the Immigration Judge in 2001, the filing of an adjustment of status application in 2002 based on his ex-wife’s visa petition, or the failure to inform the Immigration Judge and the Board of the approved sibling visa petition. Also, assuming Mr. Tzeuton failed to inform the respondent of his voluntary departure order, we find prejudice has not been shown as the respondent would not be found to have voluntarily failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1), if he was unaware of the order through no fault of his own. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007).¿FN3º
 
Finally, a motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status does not fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). We generally will not reopen proceedings sua sponte when an alien’s eligibility for relief arises many years after the Immigration Judge’s final order, and the respondent has not persuaded us that an exceptional situation exists in this case that warrants the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

We will grant the respondent’s filing fee waiver request, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8, but will deny the request for a stay of removal in light of our denial of the motion to reopen.

The respondent appears to acknowledge that he had no further contact with Mr. Tzeuton after August 2003 (Motion at 10-11, tabs B-C, H).

The allegations concerning failure to reschedule an interview with the USCIS in August 2003 appear unrelated to any potential eligibility for relief while these proceedings were pending.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Glenn Fogle, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia D. Goodman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 10, 2010. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable based on his criminal convictions and denied a request for a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On June 1, 1995, the respondent was convicted of Possession with Intent to Distribute Marijuana, in violation of Louisiana law. On June 25, 2008, the respondent was convicted of Felon in Possession of a Firearm in violation of Louisiana law. A record of each of these convictions was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exhs. 3, 4. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). In addition, the respondent admitted the convictions. See Tr. at 8. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c).
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation, an aggravated felony relating to illicit trafficking in a controlled substance, and a firearms violation. See Exh. 1. The respondent, through counsel, conceded removability. See Tr. at 8. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. See I.J. at 2.
 
At the hearing, the respondent requested a continuance of the proceedings to collaterally attack his conviction. See Tr. at 3-6, 27-28. The Immigration Judge denied that motion. See I.J. at 3-4. The respondent requested no other relief. See Tr. at 28; I.J. at 3.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that, before the Immigration Judge, he requested a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995). He requests remand to enable the respondent to be considered for that relief. However, as previously noted, the respondent requested no relief other than a continuance. Moreover, we note that the respondent does not assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent may bring a motion to reopen if he believes he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. However, he must comply with the prerequisites for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998); Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David R. Fletcher, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James E. M. Craig
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision, dated July 23, 2009, denying his motion to terminate proceedings and ordering him removed from the United States to the Dominican Republic. The respondent also filed a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes a remand. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1965. He is charged with removability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii), in relation to violations of a protection order in 2003. The respondent, with the assistance of representation, admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear (NTA) and conceded removability. Based on these admissions and concessions, and considering that the allegations were corroborated by conviction records, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. He also found the respondent not eligible for relief from removal, and ordered him removed.
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the finding of removability. He asserts that the NTA refers to judicial decisions issued in Duval County, Florida, but that he has never been convicted in that jurisdiction. Upon review of the conviction records in the file, it is evident that the respondent was found to have violated a protective order in Clay County, Florida, rather than in Duval County (see Exh. 2). The documents otherwise track the information in the NTA, including that the respondent had been found to have violated an existing protective order on May 29, 2003, and July 17, 2003 (Id).¿FN1º Under these circumstances, we deem the inclusion of Duval County in the NTA, rather than Clay County, to be tantamount to a scrivener’s error, and that it does not undermine the Immigration Judge’s ultimate finding of removability. We therefore will not remand the record on this basis as requested by the respondent.
 
On appeal, the respondent also emphasizes that he will be pursuing, or may intend to pursue, post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on his convictions. This however, does not affect the validity of his convictions for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992); Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). We point out that the Immigration Judge gave the respondent several continuances to pursue post-conviction relief and at this juncture, there is no evidence that any motion has been adjudicated. The respondent also contends that the criminal attorney who was to assist him in getting his conviction vacated has been ineffective; that is, however, not something we could remedy in these removal proceedings.
 
*2 The respondent also contends that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel because his representative in removal proceedings conceded the removal charge even though he has never been convicted of a crime in Duval County. As discussed above, the record supports the respondent’s removability except for the mistaken county reference in the NTA. Under the circumstances, we do not find that counsel’s failure to address this error amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not shown prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA 1988). This is because but for the scrivener’s error, the record supports the finding of removability and the respondent has not satisfactorily explained how the result in this case would change if the proceedings were remanded. We additionally are not convinced by the respondent’s argument that his former counsel was ineffective in assisting him in getting his criminal convictions vacated for immigration purposes. In any event, without persuasive evidence that the 2003 convictions would have been vacated in a timely manner for purposes recognized by the immigration law, we cannot discern any prejudice.
 
The respondent makes no arguments on appeal concerning the Immigration Judge’s finding that he could not establish eligibility from relief from removal. Accordingly, those matters will not be further addressed. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed, and the motion to remand is denied.

We note that on appeal, the respondent has submitted a Register of Actions from Clay County to show that the July 17, 2003, judgment relates only to the failure to pay a fine. See Resp.’s Appeal Exh. F; cf. Exh. 2. Even if no violation of a protective order was found on this date, the record would still support removability based upon the May 29, 2003, conviction.

APPLICATION: Reopening; waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cuba, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 12, 2010. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s July 29, 2010, motion to reopen the record of proceeding. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is subject to an administratively final order of removal entered on March 13, 2003. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed over 7 years after the expiration of the 90-day filing period, is time-barred. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2010); see also Abdi v. Attorney General of the United States, 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005). To the extent the respondent seeks to equitably toll the filing deadline under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the procedural or substantive requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). To the extent he seeks to apply for relief from removal under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)(1993), the respondent was convicted of the underlying aggravated felony on June 18, 1993, after a trial, as opposed to a guilty plea agreement. Thus, he does not come under the class of aliens contemplated in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (Respondent’s Motion To Reopen at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(1); see also Ferguson v. United States Attorney General, 563 F.3d 1254, 1271 (11th Cir. 2009) (“Joining the majority of circuits, we decline to extend St. Cyr to aliens who were convicted after a trial because such aliens’ decisions to go to trial do not satisfy St. Cyr’s reliance requirement. Therefore, § 212(c) relief is not available to such aliens.” (footnote and citations omitted)). And, to the extent he seeks to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, his aggravated felony conviction renders him ineligible for this form of relief. Finally, the respondent has not supported the motion to reopen with an application for any form of relief from removal.¿FN1º

We note that the respondent’s allegation of error relating to the form of the Immigration Judge’s decision is without merit (Respondent’s Br. at 5). The conditions pertaining to “summary decisions” under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.12(b) relate to decisions issued at the conclusion of the removal proceeding, not to a subsequent decision denying a manifestly non-meritorious motion to reopen.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert E. Coughlon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s April 29, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings that were completed in September 1997. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, for clear error. See United States v. National Assn. of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485, 495 (1950) (a factual finding is not “clearly erroneous” merely because there are two permissible views of the evidence). The Board uses a de novo standard of review for questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
As background, the respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful temporary resident in 1988 (I.J.’s September 23, 1997, order at 3). In or around 1997, he was detained after showing his resident alien card at a border crossing, because he had been convicted of one or more controlled substance violations (Id. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge found that he was removable as charged and that he was ineligible for the relief of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act because he had not accrued the requisite period of continuous residence (Id. at 3-4). Although the respondent waived appeal of this decision, he nevertheless filed an appeal with the Board, which we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The respondent was apparently removed thereafter.
 
In 2006, the respondent was served with another Notice to Appear, charging that after his removal, he reentered or attempted to reenter the United States without inspection (See Notice to Appear dated January 31, 2006) (unmarked as an exhibit). On February 22, 2006, an Immigration Judge entered an order of removal to Mexico, and the respondent waived appeal. The respondent apparently was removed in compliance with this order. See I.J.’s April 29, 2009, order at 1.
 
On September 11, 2008, the respondent filed with the Board a motion to reopen, seeking reopening of the 1997 removal proceedings, so that he could file an application for a waiver of inadmissibility to waive the immigration consequences of his controlled substance violation. Because an appeal to the Board had never been perfected by the respondent, we returned the record to the Immigration Court without taking any action. See Board’s March 20, 2009, order. On April 13, 2009, the respondent filed the same motion with the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on April 29, 2009, stating that the motion was time barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(h) and that the respondent did not establish that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act because aliens who are issued a final order of removal who then illegally return to the United States are ineligible for section 212(c) relief pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2). This appeal followed.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that his prior removal should not be a bar to obtaining a waiver of inadmissibility because of a precedent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Reynoso v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2007), where the court overturned a Board decision denying a motion to reopen filed after a prior removal. The Ninth Circuit found that the Board’s reliance on 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) was misplaced, because that regulation only precluded motions to reopen by aliens who depart the United States while they are the subject of removal proceedings, but does not expressly bar a motion filed by an alien who departed “after the completion of immigration proceedings.” Reynoso v. Gonzales, supra, at 1002. The respondent argues that reopening is warranted because of the existence of the Reynoso v. Gonzales, supra, case, combined with the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (preserving potential for section 212(c) waivers for aliens who pled guilty in reliance on such relief).
 
We will dismiss the appeal and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. We first note that we lack jurisdiction to consider the motion. In Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646, 653 (BIA 2008), we stated that, notwithstanding the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Reynoso v. Gonzales, supra, applicable regulations prohibit our (and the Immigration Judge’s) consideration of a motion filed by an alien who has departed the United States after the conclusion of proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). We stated that we would continue to apply this rule “within the Ninth Circuit.” Matter of Armendarez, supra, at 653
 
Moreover, even if jurisdiction over this motion was proper, the respondent’s motion is untimely. Generally, a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The motion clearly indicates that the respondent is seeking reopening of the proceedings that concluded in 1997 with the entry of an order of removal. The motion was therefore filed some 12 years after the final administrative order. Even if the respondent was seeking reopening of the more recent proceedings that ended with the entry of a final order of removal in 2006, he still filed his motion some 2 years later.
 
As an explanation, the respondent claims that he was not aware until the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Reynoso v. Gonzales, supra, that he was entitled to file a motion to reopen after removal from the United States. See Respondent’s Brief at 2, 8-9. We first note that this argument does not relate to any exception to the 90-day deadline that is contained in the regulations or any exception that has been recognized by the Board,¿FN1º but appears to instead seek our sua sponte reopening. Putting our decision in Matter of Armedarez, supra, aside, even if the decision in Reynoso triggered the respondent’s eligibility for relief and even if we accept the respondent’s argument that this decision trumps the effect of the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2), we note that Reynoso was decided by the Ninth Circuit on June 7, 2007. The respondent did not attempt to file a motion to reopen until September 11, 2008, more than one year later. There is no explanation for why such a long delay preceded the filing of the motion. We are not inclined to find this motion appropriate for sua sponte reopening. Therefore, even assuming that jurisdiction over the motion is present, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision rejecting the motion, because we find that it is untimely.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The regulations contain exceptions to deadlines for filing motions to reopen when an alien files an asylum claim based on a material change in country conditions and extends the deadline in cases where an alien was ordered removed in absentia. See 8 C.F.R. § 2003.23(b)(3). The Board and the Immigration Courts also have reopened cases filed more than 90 days after a final administrative order in which an alien proves that he acted to his detriment on ineffective assistance of counsel that prejudiced his claims and where the motion was diligently filed within a reasonable time after discovery of the ineffective assistance.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on July 9, 2010, at which time a motion to reopen filed by the respondent was denied. The respondent filed the November 12, 2010, motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The respondent has complied with the process requisite to asserting such a claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). The respondent has provided a detailed affidavit describing the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, has notified counsel and the bar authorities of the claim, and counsel has not replied to the allegations. Evidence of record establishes that from 1997 through 2010, the respondent was represented by attorneys Michael Leavitt and Elizabeth Cohen, who, during that time frame were suspended and expelled, respectively, from the practice of law before the Executive Office for Immigration Review. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted and the record remanded for further proceedings to allow the respondent the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.

The record does not contain an EOIR-27 reflecting that the respondent is represented by counsel in these proceedings. It appears that attorney Rashmi N. Patel, Esquire, filed an EOIR-28 reflecting his representation of the respondent in proceedings before the Immigration Court rather than the Board of Immigration Appeals. A courtesy copy of this decision will be directed to Mr. Patel.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thelma O. Garcia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason D. Goodchild
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 14, 2010. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal convictions.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On March 26, 1997, the respondent was convicted of Burglary and Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon, both felonies, in violation of Florida law. On May 8, 2000, the respondent was convicted of Possession of Cocaine, in violation of Florida law. A record of each of these convictions was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exhs. 2, 3. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). The respondent admitted to each of these convictions. See Tr. at 15-17, 19-20. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). In addition, because of the name discrepancy, an immigration officer testified that he obtained the photo and fingerprints relating to the 1997 conviction and submitted them to the F.B.I., which reported a match for the respondent. See Tr. at 26-28. Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the convictions proved. See I.J. at 2.
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation and a crime involving moral turpitude. See Exh. 1. Based on the convictions, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. See Tr. at 36; I.J. at 2.
 
The respondent expressed no fear of return and requested no relief from removal, and the Immigration Judge concluded he was ineligible for relief. See Tr. at 36-37; I.J. at 3. The respondent did request a continuance of his removal hearing to enable him to pursue a motion to vacate his convictions pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).¿FN1º However, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. See Tr. at 37-38; I.J. at 3.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent disputes removability. Based on the documentary evidence of the convictions in the record, the respondent’s admissions, and the immigration officer’s testimony, we find that the convictions have been proved. On consideration of this evidence, we also find that removability has been proved by clear and convincing evidence. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10.
 
On appeal, the respondent also challenges denial of the continuance. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. However, we conclude that good cause was not shown. While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion does not render the convictions non-final. See Matter of Madrigal, supra. The convictions became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal them, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his convictions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A). See also Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211, 216-17 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1985); Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-93 (2d Cir. 1976).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is untimely filed and number barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, inasmuch as we reject the respondent’s lack of notice claim, the respondent has not demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his former counsel’s alleged action or inaction. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor has he sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). It is undisputed that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear. Further, the respondent does not dispute that notice of his August 20, 1999, scheduled hearing was not only properly mailed to his former counsel, but also properly mailed to him at the last known address he provided. Where a Notice of Hearing is properly addressed and sent by regular mail according to normal office procedures, there is a presumption, albeit a weaker presumption than that which applies to documents sent by certified mail, of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Under the circumstances, the respondent’s assertion alone is insufficient to demonstrate that he did not receive his hearing notice. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving, denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”). On this record, the respondent has failed to show he did not receive the Notice of Hearing, which was properly mailed to the last known address provided by the respondent. Finally, we find no reason for further consideration of the respondent’s claim on our own motion pursuant to this Board’s sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Omar A. Abuzir, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s June 15, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the current motion. The motion, however, does not allege or demonstrate an error of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Consequently, it fails as a motion to reconsider.
 
Rather, the respondent seeks to submit new evidence, in the form of his affidavit setting forth his claim that his ex-wife admitted to him that she received the notice of hearing but deliberately withheld it from him (Motion, attached affidavit). As such, the motion is in the nature of a second motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order of removal that was entered against him in April 2009, based on a claim of exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. Only one motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal is allowed. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) and 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) & (c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)& 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). As the current motion is the respondent’s second claiming exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the scheduled hearing, it is number-barred. In addition, a motion claiming exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear must be filed within 180 days of the final removal order. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. This second motion claiming exceptional circumstances has not been filed within 180 days of the April 2009 in absentia removal order. Thus, the motion is both untimely and number-barred, and will be denied.
 
The respondent’s vague allegation that his prior attorney never told him to provide an affidavit setting forth the facts supporting his claim that his ex-wife deliberately withheld the notice of hearing is insufficient to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that might serve to equitably toll the time and number limits for this motion. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Parvaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488 (7th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

MATTER OF D-R-, RESPONDENT
Interim Decision #3708
Decided April 6, 2011
**1 *445 (1) The respondent’s deliberate omission from his refugee application that he was a special police officer during the Bosnian War, during which time he served in an entity that was part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Srpska, could have affected or influenced the Government’s decision whether to grant him refugee status and was therefore a willful misrepresentation of a material fact.
 
(2) The respondent is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(D) (2006), where the totality of the record supported the conclusion that he assisted in the extrajudicial killing of 200 Bosnian Muslims that his unit was involved in capturing, including evidence of his command responsibility, his presence, his platoon’s active participation, and the finding that he must have been aware that many other Bosnian Muslims who were similarly situated had been executed nearby several days earlier.
 
(3) An Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole and is not required to accept a respondent’s account where other plausible views of the evidence are supported by the record.
 
(4) An expert witness is broadly defined as one who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education and who has specialized knowledge that will assist the Immigration Judge to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.

Charles W. Baccus
Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: GRANT, MALPHRUS, and MULLANE, Board Members.
MALPHRUS, Board Member:
The respondent, a native and citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina and lawful permanent resident of the United States, has appealed from a written decision of the Immigration Judge, dated November 24, 2009, finding the respondent removable based on conduct arising out of his service as a special police officer during the Bosnian War and ordering him removed from the United States to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Immigration Judge found that *446 the respondent’s omission from his refugee application that he had served as a special police officer constituted a willful misrepresentation of a material fact, which rendered him removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) (2006), as an alien who was inadmissible at the time of entry under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) (2006). The Immigration Judge also concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) had proven by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent “assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing and is therefore removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act. Consequently, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States.
 
**2 The respondent argues that his omission from the refugee application was not a material misrepresentation and that the Immigration Judge engaged in impermissible speculation to conclude that he assisted in an extrajudicial killing. He also argues that he was denied a fair hearing because counsel in the proceedings below did not object to the DHS’s documentary evidence and testimony, and he makes other arguments that he claims warrant a remand or termination of proceedings. The DHS has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained in part and dismissed in part, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge to determine whether they are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); see also Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment, including the question whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209 (BIA 2010).
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The Bosnian War was a civil conflict arising from the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia. It was fought from 1991 to 1995 between the ethnic Serb-dominated Republic of Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was dominated by Bosnian Muslims. Prior to the war, the respondent served as a police officer for 21 years in the Republic of Srpska, where he specialized in training dogs to search for drugs and criminals. During the civil war, consistent with the Republic of Srpska Constitution, the Republic of Srpska Ministry of Internal Affairs police force, known as the “MUP,” became part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Srpska.
 
During this time, the respondent was employed as a special police officer, and in the summer of 1995, he was assigned to the Special Police Brigade at the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ Jahorina Training Center, which was overseen by Dusko Jevic. While there, the respondent served as the leader *447 of the third platoon in the 2nd Company of the Training Center, where about 25 special police officers served under his command. His duties included being a dog training instructor and training police officers to secure or guard roads and regulate traffic. The respondent’s platoon and two others were under the command of Nedjo Ikonic.
 
One of the final major events of the war concerned what became known as the Srebrenica massacre, where, in July 1995, the Serbian forces took control of a United Nations safe area in eastern Bosnia and, over the course of 1 week, executed between 5,000 and 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys. To prove its case, the DHS presented expert testimony and documents from the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague (“ICTY”) and the Bosnian War Crimes Tribunal.
 
**3 The documentary evidence, which the Immigration Judge found to be relevant and probative, included State Department reports, findings from ICTY trial judgments, and copies of real-time dispatch reports from field officers during the war that were seized by the ICTY after the war. It also included a 5-minute video compiled by the prosecutor for the ICTY as part of the proceedings in the prosecution of Vidoje Blagojevic and Dragan Jokic and photographic images from a video taken by an independent Belgrade filmmaker, both of which primarily showed captured Bosnian Muslims along the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road on July 13, 1995. See Prosecutor v. Vidoje Blagojevic and Dragan Jokic, Case No. IT-02-60-T, Trial Judgement (Int’l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia Jan. 17, 2005), http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_ jokic/tjug/en/bla-050117e.pdf.
 
The record also included MUP records showing the respondent’s service with the Special Police Brigade during the war. Richard Butler, a criminal research specialist with the DHS who formerly worked as a military analyst for the ICTY, testified on military operations that occurred in Eastern Bosnia from 1992 to 1995, including those specifically related to the Srebrenica massacre. The Immigration Judge found his expert testimony to be credible and persuasive.
 
The testimony and evidence showed that as the Serbian Army overtook Srebrenica and Bosnian Muslims fled the area, thousands were executed. See, e.g., Prosecutor v. Radislav Kristic, Case No. IT-98-33-T, Trial Judgement (Int’l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia Aug. 2, 2001), http:// www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf [hereinafter ICTY Kristic Trial Judgement] (“As thousands of them attempted to flee the area, they were taken prisoner, detained in brutal conditions and then executed.”). Butler testified that when the Serbian Army overtook Srebrenica, the Commander of the Jahorina Training Center received an urgent message to secure the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road between Konjevic Polje and the village of Kravika, a key escape route through the rugged mountainous terrain for fleeing Bosnian Muslims. Butler explained that the respondent’s platoon, *448 along with others from the Training Center, arrived on the road on July 12 and stayed until at least July 19. During that week, they did not leave the area and even slept outdoors.
 
While there, the respondent’s platoon and others secured or guarded segments of the road and conducted joint “sweep” operations with Army troops and other special police in the surrounding mountainous area to secure the road and nearby area from escaping Bosnian Muslims. Butler’s testimony referenced a real-time field report in evidence, which stated that “two MUP companies [including] part of the forces for the Dog Breeding and Training Center [led by the respondent] have sealed off the area and are fighting the remaining Muslim forces from Srebrenica.” Butler also testified that between July 12 and July 18, 1995, many Bosnian Muslims surrendered or were captured along various segments of this road and that field communications showed that the MUP were almost entirely responsible for securing the road.
 
**4 On the morning of July 13, 1995, a total of about 1,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys (as young as age 15) surrendered on different points of the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road, including in the area of Sandici-Novici, which is the area of the road where the respondent testified that he and his platoon were stationed. Evidence showed Bosnian Muslims being induced to come out of the rough terrain by promises of food and water and humane treatment. Those who surrendered were taken to a warehouse in the village of Kravica, traveling in a convoy of dozens of trucks and buses on the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road that the respondent and his men helped patrol. At the warehouse, which was less than 2 miles from the respondent’s position on the road, MUPs shot and killed approximately 1,000 men and boys within 2 hours. Butler testified that they were then buried in mass graves.
 
On July 16 or 17, the 2nd Company Special Police Brigade under Ikonic’s command, which included the respondent’s platoon as well as two Army units from the Bratunac Brigade, were involved in a joint sweep operation that resulted in the capture of about 200 Bosnian Muslim men and boys and four young children along the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road.
 
Jevic, the commander of the Training Center where the 2nd Company Special Police Brigade was based, testified on behalf of the respondent by televideo. According to his own testimony, Jevic was responsible for having the men loaded onto the buses. Those under Jevic’s command, including the respondent’s platoon, loaded the men onto buses before they were driven away. Jevic said that it was his understanding that the men were to be taken to Zvornik and that he could not have known what would happen to them. Jevic also stated that he never ordered these or any other captured Bosnian Muslims to be killed. Furthermore, he said he had no knowledge that anyone under his command, including the respondent, ordered these or any other captured men to be killed.
 
*449 It is undisputed that none of the 200 who were captured were ever heard from again.1 According to Butler’s testimony, they were apparently killed unlawfully, probably in a manner similar to the men at the Kravica warehouse. Butler also testified that it was well known by the time these 200 were captured that mass executions of Bosnian Muslims were taking place.
 
Four years later, in June 1999, the respondent was admitted to the United States as a refugee, and he subsequently adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident in January 2002. The respondent omitted from his application for refugee status that he served as a special police officer in the Republic of Srpska during the Bosnian War.2 He testified that he omitted this information because an International Organization for Migration (“IOM”) agent who assisted him in completing his application told him that he would be disqualified for refugee status if he revealed his former employment as a police officer. The respondent argues that the evidence does not establish that this omission constitutes a willful misrepresentation of a material fact under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
 
**5 In addition, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge engaged in improper speculation to conclude that he “assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing and is therefore removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act. The respondent does not dispute that he was present at the time the 200 men, all of whom he said were adult soldiers, surrendered to the police and military units that were there at the time, and he said that the Army took them away on the buses. He said that he did not know where the men were being taken or what would happen to them. He also denied ever hearing about the Kravica warehouse killings or any other mass executions of Bosnian Muslims while he served in the special police during the war.
  
*450 II. ANALYSIS
  
A. Material Misrepresentation
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s omission from his application for refugee status that he served as a special police officer in the Republic of Srpska constitutes a willful misrepresentation of a material fact, which renders him removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act as an alien who was inadmissible at the time of entry. Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act renders inadmissible any alien who, “by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act.” The test for whether “concealments or misrepresentations were material is whether they had a natural tendency to influence the decisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.” Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 772 (1988); see also Mwongera v. INS, 187 F.3d 323, 330 (3d Cir. 1999) (citing Matter of Kai Hing Hui, 15 I&N Dec. 288, 289 (BIA 1975)); Matter of Bosuego, 17 I&N Dec. 125, 130 (BIA 1979, 1980) (stating that a misrepresentation is material if it “tends to shut off a line of inquiry which is relevant to the alien’s eligibility and which might well have resulted in a proper determination that he be excluded”). It is not necessary for the Government to show that the statement actually influenced the agency, only that the misrepresentation was capable of affecting or influencing the governmental decision. United States v. Matsumaru, 244 F.3d 1092, 1101 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
The respondent admits that he failed to disclose his former employment as a police officer during the Bosnian War on his refugee application but argues that it was not a material misrepresentation. We do not agree.
 
Todd Gardner, a Special Assistant with the Refugee Affairs Division of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, who is also an attorney and an expert in refugee processing, testified that failure to disclose police and military service during the Bosnian War would have prevented an appropriate line of inquiry regarding whether the applicant was barred from refugee status as a persecutor. He said that including this information would have prompted further questioning because of the human rights abuses that occurred during the war, although it would not have caused an automatic rejection of an application.
 
**6 Contrary to the respondent’s argument, the DHS does not need to establish that but for the misrepresentation, the respondent would have been denied refugee status. See United States v. Matsumaru, 244 F.3d at 1101; see also, e.g., Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 443 F.3d 804, 812-13 (11th Cir. 2006). The respondent’s deliberate omission from his refugee application that he was a special police officer in the Republic of Srpska during the Bosnian War *451 could have influenced the Government’s decision whether to grant him refugee status. Accordingly, the respondent’s concealment constitutes a willful misrepresentation of a material fact, which renders him removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act.3
  
B. Extrajudicial Killing
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the DHS has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent “committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing and therefore is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act. This section cross-references section 212(a)(3)(E), which was amended by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-458, 118 Stat. 3638 (“IRTPA”), to make aliens who have committed torture or extrajudicial killings inadmissible to, and removable from, the United States.4 Specifically, section 5501(a) of the IRTPA, 118 Stat. at 3740, amended section 212(a)(3)(E) of the Act by adding the following provision:
(iii) Commission of Acts of Torture or Extrajudicial Killings
 
Any alien who, outside the United States, has committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the commission of—
 
(I) any act of torture, as defined in section 2340 of title 18, United States Code; or
 
(II) under color of law of any foreign nation, any extrajudicial killing, as defined in section 3(a) of the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (28 U.S.C. 1350 note), is inadmissible.5
 
 
*452 To determine whether the respondent is subject to removability under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act, the DHS must establish that he acted “under color of law” and that he “committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated” in the commission of an extrajudicial killing. The respondent’s actions during this period were clearly under color of law. His service with the Jahorina Training Center Special Police Brigade in 1995 was under the authority of the commander of the Center, and under the Constitution of the Republic of Srpska, the special police answered to the military command during wartime. However, even if he had been a police officer who was not under the control of the military in 1995, for purposes of this statute, he would have been acting under the color of law in his employment as a police officer for the Republic of Srpska.
 
**7 The respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s determination that the DHS proved by clear and convincing evidence that he “ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing. While the Act does not define the phrase “ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated,” the Attorney General has interpreted this phrase in the context of the persecutor bar, saying that “[t]he plain meaning of the relevant words in the statute is broad enough to encompass aid and support provided by a political leader to those who carry out the goals of his group, including statements of incitement or encouragement and actions that result in advancing the violent activities of the group.” Matter of A-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 774, 784 (A.G. 2005). The terms “are to be given broad application” and “do not require direct personal involvement in the acts of persecution.” Id. “It is appropriate to look at the totality of the relevant conduct in determining whether the bar to eligibility applies.” Id. at 785.
 
The United States Senate Report for the proposed Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2003, S.710, 108th Cong. (2003), explains the role of command authority as a form of assistance or participation in persecution and indicates the intended broad reach of the legislation. S. Rep. No. 108-209, at 10, 2003 WL 22846178, at *10 (Leg. Hist.). The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2003 was not passed as separate legislation, but the statutory language from this bill was incorporated into the IRTPA, which was enacted into law. The report states that the proposed act was “intended to close loopholes in U.S. immigration laws that have allowed aliens who have committed serious forms of human rights abuses abroad to enter and remain in the country.” Id. at 1-2, 2003 WL 22846178, at *1-2. It further provides as follows:
The statutory language—“committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in”—is intended to reach the behavior of persons directly or personally associated with the covered acts, including those with command responsibility. Command responsibility holds a commander responsible for unlawful acts when (1) the forces who committed the abuses were subordinates of the commander (i.e., *453 the forces were under his control either as a matter of law or as a matter of fact); (2) the commander knew, or, in light of the circumstances at the time, should have known, that subordinates had committed, were committing, or were about to commit unlawful acts; and (3) the commander failed to prove that he had taken the necessary and reasonable measures to (a) prevent or stop subordinates from committing such acts, or (b) investigate the acts committed by subordinates in a genuine effort to punish the perpetrators. Attempts and conspiracies to commit these crimes are encompassed in the “otherwise participated in” language. This language addresses an appropriate range of levels of complicity for which aliens should be held accountable, and has been the subject of extensive judicial interpretation and construction. See Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. 490, 514 (1981); Kalejs v. INS, 10 F.3d 441, 444 (7th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Schmidt, 923 F.2d 1253, 1257-59 (7th Cir. 1991); Kulle v. INS, 825 F.2d 1188, 1192 (7th Cir. 1987).
 
**8 Id. at 10, 2003 WL 22846178, at *10.
 
The cases cited in this provision indicate that there is a continuum of conduct ranging from passive acceptance, which does not meet the legal standard, to active, personal participation, which clearly does. See United States v. Schmidt, 923 F.2d at 1258 (citing Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. at 512 n.34). See generally Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 208, 213-14 (BIA 2007) (discussing the particular significance of cases that Congress cited with approval in legislative history). These cited cases also make clear that one can be found to have “assisted” in persecution even if he has not “personally engaged in acts of violence.” Id.; see also Kalejs v. INS, 10 F.3d at 444 (stating that “assistance” in persecution is an independent basis for deportation, which “may be inferred from the general nature of the person’s role in the war, so the atrocities committed by a unit may be attributed to the individual based on his membership and seeming participation”). In light of this legislative history, we conclude that inadmissibility under section 212(a)(3)(E) of the Act is established where it is shown that an alien with command responsibility knew or should have known that his subordinates committed unlawful acts covered by the statute and failed to prove that he took reasonable measures to prevent or stop such acts or investigate in a genuine effort to punish the perpetrators.
 
The Immigration Judge made reasonable inferences from the totality of the record to conclude that the respondent assisted in the commission of extrajudicial killings because he knew that the 200 Bosnian Muslims would be killed unlawfully, and even if he did not, he should have known that they would. We find no clear error in these factual findings. See Matter of J-B-N& S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 215 (finding no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s fact-finding as to the persecutors’ motive); Matter of S-P-, 21 I&N Dec. 486, 489-90 (BIA 1996) (noting that the motivation of the persecutor involves questions of fact).
 
The respondent argues that he did not know what would happen to the 200 captured Bosnian Muslims and that the Immigration Judge’s conclusions to the *454 contrary were speculative. However, the Immigration Judge’s findings were based on reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence of the record as a whole, not on speculation. It is clear that “rank speculation and conjecture ‘cannot be substituted for objective and substantial evidence.”’ Nuru v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1207, 1226 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Bandari v. INS, 227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir. 2000)); see also Salaam v. INS, 229 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that factual findings cannot be based on an “unsupported assumption”). However, an “inference is not a suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists on the basis of another fact that is known to exist.” Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 168 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 448 (2d Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). An inference is not impermissible as long as it is supported by “record facts, or even a single fact, viewed in the light of common sense and ordinary experience.” Id. at 169. “Drawing inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence is a routine and necessary task of any factfinder,” and “[i]n the immigration context, the IJ is the factfinder.” Id. at 167.
 
**9 The Immigration Judge reasonably found, based on the testimony and evidence, that the respondent was aware of the Kravica warehouse killings before his unit was involved in capturing the 200 men and boys in question several days later. For example, the ICTY Krstic Trial Judgment, which was introduced as evidence in these proceedings, concluded that the Drina Corps Command “must have been well aware of the fact that the executions had taken place at the Kravica Warehouse” by the evening of July 13, 1995, given their proximity to the area and the noise and high levels of activity associated with the massive scale of the executions. ICTY Krstic Trial Judgment, supra, at ¶ 215. Butler indicated that it was implausible that the respondent would not have heard the mass executions, based on his close proximity to the Kravika warehouse. Moreover, an International Warrant for the respondent’s arrest issued by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was also admitted into evidence, states that the respondent “knew that his subordinates took part in the execution of detainees at Kravica.”
 
Given that the respondent must have been aware of the Kravica warehouse killings, it was also reasonable for the Immigration Judge to infer that the respondent assisted in the unlawful killing of the 200 Bosnian Muslims that his unit was involved in capturing on the same stretch of road a few days later because he knew or should have known that they would face a similar fate. As Butler testified, it was well known at this time that Serbians were committing mass killings of Bosnian Muslims. While there is no evidence that the respondent ordered any extrajudicial killing, the totality of the record supports the conclusion that he assisted in such killing. This includes his command responsibility, his presence, his platoon’s active participation, and the finding that he must have been aware that mass killings of other similarly *455 situated Bosnian Muslims were ongoing at this time, particularly the nearby mass execution at the Kravica warehouse several days earlier.
 
The Immigration Judge was not required to credit the respondent’s wholesale denial of any knowledge or culpability related to the mass executions of Bosnian Muslims captured on the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road.6 She did not commit clear error in crediting the version of events that the DHS presented through expert testimony and documentary evidence. An Immigration Judge is not required to accept a respondent’s assertions, even if plausible, where there are other permissible views of the evidence based on the record. See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985) ( “Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”); see also Blanco v. Mukasey, 518 F.3d 714, 721 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding that it was not error for the Immigration Judge to reject the applicant’s plausible account of the circumstances based on contrary evidence); Don v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d 738, 744 (9th Cir. 2007) (stating that the Immigration Judge is not required to interpret the evidence in the manner advocated by the applicant).
 
**10 The Immigration Judge reasonably rejected the respondent’s claims of “ignorance” about the circumstances, finding that his testimony “was contradicted on multiple occasions by the testimony of other witnesses and the documents.” For example, the respondent testified that he was not aware of any mass executions taking place while he was involved in guarding and patrolling the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road and claimed that he had never heard of the Kravica warehouse killings. However, Butler testified that it was not plausible that the respondent would have been unaware of the Kravica warehouse killings at the time they happened. The respondent claimed that he and his men were stationed on the road for only 3 or 4 days on dates that he could not remember, while Butler testified that they were there from July 12 until at least July 19.
 
The respondent also claimed his platoon’s only interaction with Bosnian Muslims was upon the surrender of the 100 to 200 men, that he never saw buses travel along the road other than the three buses for these men, and that when his platoon was involved in joint sweep operations, they were not looking for “anything specific.” However, Butler testified that there was much traffic on the road during this period, including on July 12 and 13 when thousands of women and children who had been taken out of Srebrenica after *456 being separated from men and boys were transported along this road in dozens of convoys of buses. In addition, Jevic testified in a transcribed interview for the ICTY, which was included in the record in this case, that the respondent’s platoon encountered dead Bosnian Muslims while conducting sweep operations along the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road on July 16 and 17.7 Jevic also indicated that the purpose of the sweep operations was to find escaping Bosnian Muslims.
 
The need for a fact-finder to consider both direct and circumstantial evidence in the persecutor bar context is well established. See, e.g., INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483-84 (1992) (holding that persecutors’ motives may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence). It is often the case that there is not direct evidence that the respondent persecuted anyone, in part because of the lack of victim witnesses. See Kalejs v. INS, 10 F.3d at 444. The fact-finding in the persecutor bar context is analogous to the fact-finding in the context of extrajudicial killing. Also, contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the evidence here establishes more than a simple case of men dying incident to the military objectives inherent in a civil war. Instead, many men and boys who surrendered, often under the guise of humane treatment, were captured and later executed. Moreover, the respondent does not claim to have even asked what happened to the 200 who surrendered to his unit and others, at that time or any later time.
 
**11 Given the testimony and evidence as a whole, the Immigration Judge made reasonable inferences from the record to conclude that the respondent knew or should have known that the 200 men and boys would be unlawfully killed. Consequently, the DHS met its burden to establish that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act.
 
The respondent alternatively argues that the application of this ground of removability to him would be impermissibly retroactive. It is true that the conduct in dispute occurred in 1995, years prior to the enactment of the IRTPA in 2004. However, the IRTPA provides that the amendments to sections 212(a)(3)(E) and 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act shall apply to “offenses committed before, on, or after the date of enactment” of the IRTPA. IRTPA § 5501(c), 118 Stat. at 3740. Thus, his argument is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. See Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.S. 30, 37 (2006). In any event, “neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board may rule on the constitutionality of the statutes that we administer.” Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1035 (BIA 1999).
  
*457 C. Documentary Evidence and Expert Testimony
 
The respondent alternatively argues that the documentary evidence and expert testimony that the Immigration Judge relied on to conclude that he assisted in extrajudicial killings was “obviously inadmissible and unreliable evidence.” Even though his prior counsel eventually stipulated at the hearing that he had no objection to the admissibility of any of the Government’s evidence, the respondent asserts that the attorney’s failure to object to this evidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, deprived him of due process, and warrants a remand.
 
First, the respondent’s failure to object to the admission of the evidence before the Immigration Judge constituted a waiver, and the issue was not preserved for our review on appeal. See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007); Matter of Garcia-Reyes, 19 I&N Dec. 830, 832 (BIA 1988); see also, e.g., Torres de la Cruz v. Maurer, 483 F.3d 1013, 1022-23 (10th Cir. 2007). It appears that after initially making some evidentiary objections, counsel below made a tactical decision to focus his arguments on the sufficiency of the evidence to establish whether the respondent was involved in an extrajudicial killing, given his denials. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995) (noting that “in the absence of egregious circumstances, an alien is bound by the ‘reasonable tactical actions’ of … counsel” (quoting Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986)).
 
**12 As a general rule, to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent must satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition to substantially complying with these requirements, the respondent must also show prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s negligence, the outcome of the proceedings may have been different. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). “To prevail, the respondent[] must show that the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered [the] hearing unfair.” Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998).
 
The Ninth Circuit has held that an alien need not strictly comply with all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada when the record reflects a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 588 (9th Cir. 2006).8 The respondent, through new counsel on appeal, *458 seeks to invoke this exception because he has not fulfilled the requirements of Lozada, including affording prior counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations and filing a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. We do not agree that ineffective assistance of prior counsel was clear and obvious in this case.
 
In immigration proceedings, the “sole test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair.” Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir. 1995); see also, e.g., Nyama v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 812, 816 (8th Cir. 2004); Matter of DeVera, 16 I&N Dec. 266, 268-69 (BIA 1977). It is well settled that the Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding in immigration proceedings and that Immigration Judges have broad discretion to admit and consider relevant and probative evidence. Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 265 (BIA 2010); Matter of DeVera, 16 I&N Dec. at 268; see also section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1) (2006); Navarrette-Navarrette v. Landon, 223 F.2d 234, 237 (9th Cir. 1955) (stating that “administrative tribunals may receive evidence which a court would regard as legally insufficient”).9
 
**13 The respondent argues that the DHS’s documentary evidence was inherently unreliable because it was not authenticated and there was no proper chain of custody.10 In the Ninth Circuit, official records and public documents from foreign governments may be authenticated either through the requirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1287.6 (2010) or through any recognized procedure, including the Federal Rules of Evidence. Vatyan v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 1179, 1182-83 (9th Cir. 2007). The method of authentication that the party submitting the evidence utilizes may affect the weight of the evidence, and Immigration Judges “retain broad discretion to accept a document as authentic or not based on the particular factual showing presented.” *459 Id. at 1185. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, authentication “is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims,” and may be accomplished through testimony of a “witness with knowledge.” See Fed. R. Evid. 901(a)-(b)(1).
 
In this case, Butler testified specifically about how the ICTY seized records from the archives of military and police installations, noting his own participation in some investigative search teams and operations. He also discussed the ICTY certification process for court proceedings, including how documents were identified, catalogued, and stored. While he was not involved in seizing or storing specific documents entered into evidence in this case, he recognized the indexing and control numbers that were placed on them in the certification process. He specifically discussed various documents in evidence, including MUP records of the respondent’s service during the war, ICTY trial judgments, the International Arrest Warrant, the video, and photographic images from the video footage.11 In United States v. Vidacak, 553 F.3d 344 (4th Cir. 2009), which involved a criminal prosecution in Federal district court for false statements related to immigration documents arising out of the Bosnian War, the Fourth Circuit upheld the admission of some similar evidence based on testimony by Butler.12 Also, as the Vidacak court discussed, issues regarding authentication and chain of custody generally go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Id. at 350 (citing United States v. Cardenas, 864 F.3d 1528, 1531 (10th Cir. 1989)).
 
The respondent also argues that his counsel should have objected to Butler’s qualifications as an expert witness and alleges that Butler’s testimony should have been deemed inadmissible hearsay. We do not agree. An expert witness is broadly defined as someone who is “qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.” Fed. R. Evid. 702; see also Thomas v. Newton Int’l Enterprises, 42 F.3d 1266, 1269 (9th Cir. 1994). An expert has “scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [that] will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 702; see also Matter of Marcal Neto, 25 I&N Dec. 169, 176 (BIA 2010) (stating that Immigration Judges may rely on experts “regarding matters on which they possess little or no knowledge or substantive expertise”). Butler was clearly qualified to testify as an expert on military operations during the Bosnian War. Butler worked for 7 years with *460 the ICTY as a military analyst, specifically assisted in war crimes prosecutions, is a retired U.S. Army intelligence officer, and previously testified as an expert on the Srebrenica massacre before the ICTY at the Hague, the Bosnian War Crimes Court, and Federal courts in the United States.13 See, e.g., United States v. Vidacak, 553 F.3d at 347-49.
 
**14 Further, since Butler was an expert witness, his testimony would not constitute inadmissible hearsay, even under the Federal Rules. “An expert is permitted to base his opinion on hearsay evidence and need not have personal knowledge of the facts underlying his opinion.” Aguilar-Ramos v. Holder, 594 F.3d 701, 706 n.7 (9th Cir. 2010). Also, an expert opinion may include reasonable inferences that the expert draws from the available facts and data. See Fed. R. Evid. 703. Thus, Butler’s testimony was not inadmissible, and it was proper for him to testify as to his inferences from the facts in evidence.14 Also, his testimony was clearly adequate to support the admission of the DHS’s evidence in Immigration Court.15
 
Moreover, to the extent that any of the DHS’s testimonial or documentary evidence, such as the transcript of Jevic’s testimony at the ICTY, could have *461 constituted inadmissible hearsay in Federal court, this fact alone would not make the evidence inadmissible in immigration proceedings. Hearsay is admissible in immigration proceedings if it is reliable and probative. See, e.g., Kim v. Holder, 560 F.3d 833, 836 (8th Cir. 2009); Matter of Grijalva, 19 I&N Dec. 713, 722 (BIA 1988); see also Duad v. United States, 556 F.3d 592, 596 (7th Cir. 2009) (noting that any rule prohibiting hearsay evidence in immigration proceedings would be very detrimental to many asylum seekers). However, the hearsay nature may affect the weight of the evidence. See, e.g., Gu v. Gonzales, 454 F.3d 1014, 1021 (9th Cir. 2006); Chen v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 212, 218 (3d Cir. 2005); Matter of Kwan, 14 I&N Dec. 175, 177 (BIA 1972).
 
The Immigration Judge found the evidence presented by the DHS to be relevant and probative, and she properly considered it in making her factual findings. We do not agree that this is a case which involves clear and obvious ineffective assistance resulting from prior counsel’s failure to object to that evidence. Accordingly, we find no merit to the respondent’s arguments in this regard.
  
D. Interpretation Issues
 
The respondent next generally challenges the competency of the interpreter and properly notes that “a competent translation is fundamental to a full and fair hearing.” Perez-Lastor v. INS, 208 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Matter of Tomas, 19 I&N Dec. 464, 465 (BIA 1987). In such a challenge, the respondent must show both that the interpreter did not perform competently and that his hearing was prejudiced by that failure. Hartooni v. INS, 21 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir. 1994). The respondent has not met either requirement here.
 
**15 On appeal, the respondent quotes some passages of imperfect English that he assumes are based on inaccurate translations and a few examples of confusion in the transcript, such as where the interpreter asked the witness to repeat some of his answers and to shorten them to allow her to interpret them verbatim. However, the respondent has not cited specific examples of material testimony that was not translated or was translated incorrectly. In general, interpretations are more challenging when a witness is testifying by televideo, as was the case here. An interpreter asking for clarification or making a correction to an interpretation does not necessarily show that the interpretation was inadequate and may instead indicate an effort to be as accurate as possible.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown how “a better translation would have made any difference in the hearing’s outcome.” Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1139, 1144 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent has not identified where the Immigration Judge relied on incomplete or incorrectly translated testimony *462 in reaching her decision, and he has not shown that the outcome would have been any different, particularly given the Immigration Judge’s finding that the DHS’s evidence met the Government’s burden in this case.
  
E. Termination of Removal Proceedings
 
The respondent also seeks termination of the proceedings, arguing that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to address the issues in this case and that even if she did, the proceedings should be barred, because the respondent had been granted lawful permanent resident status more than 5 years prior to the commencement of these proceedings in March 2008.
 
The respondent’s contention that many of the underlying issues in this case involve international law and war crimes, over which the Immigration Court does not have jurisdiction or competency, is wholly without merit. Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, these are civil immigration proceedings whose purpose is to determine his eligibility to remain in this country, not to punish him for criminal or other conduct in his home country. See generally INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (noting that the purpose of deportation or removal proceedings is not to punish past transgressions and that “[p]ast conduct is relevant only insofar as it may shed light on the respondent’s right to remain” in the United States).
 
As discussed above, it is the respondent who chose to apply for and obtain refugee status in the United States and who was not truthful in the representations he made in that regard. The gravamen of these proceedings concerns whether he is entitled to maintain the privilege of the lawful permanent resident status that he later received in the United States. The Immigration Court clearly has the legal authority to adjudicate these matters. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.10(b), 1240.1(a)(1) (2010).
 
**16 We also do not agree that these proceedings are barred by a statute of limitations to revoke a grant of lawful permanent resident status. To revoke a grant of adjustment of status, the DHS can commence either rescission proceedings under section 246(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1256(a) (2006), or removal proceedings under section 240. See Biggs v. INS, 55 F.3d 1398, 1401 (9th Cir. 1995). Rescission proceedings must be instituted within 5 years of the alien’s adjustment of status. See section 246(a) of the Act. However, the Act places no such time restriction on removal proceedings, which can be instituted at any time. See Biggs v. INS, 55 F.3d at 1401 & n.3.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the DHS had authority to initiate these removal proceedings, and a 5-year statute of limitations is not applicable. See Matter of Belenzo, 17 I&N Dec. 374 (BIA 1981). The respondent urges us to change our interpretation in light of Garcia v. Attorney General of the United States, 553 F.3d 724 (3d Cir. 2009), which held that a 5-year statute of limitations for seeking to rescind a grant of adjustment of status under *463 section 246(a) of the Act also applies to removal proceedings. See also Bamidele v. INS, 99 F.3d 557 (3d Cir. 1996). However, this authority is not consistent with the law of the Ninth Circuit, where the case at hand arises. See Garcia v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 553 F.3d at 728 n.4; see also Monet v. INS, 791 F.2d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1986); Oloteo v. INS, 643 F.2d 679, 681-83 (9th Cir. 1981). We generally follow a circuit court’s precedent in adjudicating a case arising in that circuit. Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989).
 
Moreover, we continue to view our longstanding approach to this issue as consistent with the overall statutory scheme and congressional intent. See Matter of C-T-L-, 25 I&N Dec. 341 (BIA 2010) (applying Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 866 (1984)). Removal proceedings are different from rescission proceedings and have greater procedural safeguards for the alien. Stolaj v. Holder, 577 F.3d 651, 656 (6th Cir. 2009). Furthermore, Congress amended section 246(a) of the Act to clarify that it is not necessary to rescind an alien’s permanent resident status before commencing removal proceedings. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 378(a), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-649; Kim v. Holder, 560 F.3d 833, 836-38 (8th Cir. 2009).
 
**17 We are aware of no circuit that has adopted the Third’s Circuit’s view regarding a 5-year statute of limitations on the commencement of removal proceedings. See Garcia v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 553 F.3d at 729-31 (Fuentes, J., dissenting); see also, e.g., Stolaj v. Holder, 577 F.3d at 655-56; Asika v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2004). Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that removal proceedings were properly instituted against the respondent.
  
F. Other Relief from Removal
 
Finally, the respondent requests that the record be remanded to allow him to seek asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46. 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988) (“Convention Against Torture”), on account of his fear of criminal prosecution for war crimes based on his service during the war. Inasmuch as the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act, he is statutorily ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture. Sections 208(b)(2)(A)(i), 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B) (2006); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(c), 1208.16(d)(2) (2010).
 
*464 However, the respondent is statutorily eligible to seek deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, and the Immigration Judge did not consider this issue in the first instance. We will therefore remand the record to the Immigration Judge for the sole purpose of providing the respondent the opportunity to establish his eligibility for such protection. See 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), 1208.16(c)(4). In remanding the record, we render no judgment on the merits of the respondent’s claim for protection. See Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. at 266. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained in part and dismissed in part, and the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained in part and dismissed in part.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

In response to the question regarding his employment on the refugee application Biographic Information sheet (Form G-325C), which he signed in September 1998, the respondent indicated that from May 1992 to the present, he was “unemployed (part time jobs).” Moreover, on his refugee application, the Form I-590 (Registration for Classification as Refugee), which he signed in October 1999, the respondent indicated that his military service was only as a private in a Yugoslavian guard unit from 1970 to 1971. Later, when completing his application for permanent residence, the respondent answered “none” to the question about military service on the Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Resident or Adjust Status), although the Immigration Judge did not address any issue of misrepresentations on that application.

3

To the extent the respondent implies that his failure to disclose his service as a police officer should be excused based on the advice he claimed to have received from the IOM officer who assisted him in completing his application, we do not agree. “‘The element of willfulness is satisfied by a finding that the misrepresentation was deliberate and voluntary.’ The INS does not need to show intent to deceive; rather, knowledge of the falsity of the representation will suffice.” Mwongera v. INS, 187 F.3d at 330 (quoting Witter v. INS, 113 F.3d 549, 554 (5th Cir 1997)); see also Espinoza-Espinoza v. INS, 554 F.2d 921, 925 (9th Cir. 1977). The respondent does not dispute that his failure to disclose the information was intentional. We therefore conclude that the willfulness element has been met.

Section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act was also amended by section 5501(b) of the IRTPA, 118 Stat. at 3740.

According to 28 U.S.C. § 1350(3)(a) (2006), the term “extrajudicial killing” means “a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.”

The respondent testified that when he saw Bosnian Muslims surrender on the road, “they would take off their weapons and put them together, and on the other side, [would put their] documents” before they were taken away in buses. Butler testified in a different context that, in general, the separation of Bosnian Muslims from their identity documents was common and was an indication that they would be executed.

When he testified in the respondent’s case, Jevic said that his testimony before the ICTY was accurate.

We do not intend to suggest that this exception to the Lozada requirements should be applied outside of this circuit.

The Federal Rules of Evidence, while not binding, may provide helpful guidance in immigration proceedings because the fact that specific evidence would be admissible under the Federal Rules “lends strong support to the conclusion that admission of the evidence comports with due process.” Felzcerek v. INS, 75 F.3d 112, 116 (2d Cir. 1996); see also, e.g., Malkandi v. Holder, 576 F.3d 906, 916 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that while strict rules of evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings, the report in question would have been admissible under the Federal Rules); Matter of DeVera, 16 I&N Dec. at 270-71 (finding that a document was properly given full weight where its reliability was ensured because it fell within an express hearsay exception under the Federal Rules of Evidence).

10

The respondent also argues that he is not fluent in English, so the DHS’s documentary evidence was inadmissible because it had not been translated into his native language. However, no such requirement exists in immigration proceedings. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.33 (2010) (providing that any foreign language document must be translated into English to be admissible in Immigration Court). In any event, the respondent used a court-provided interpreter at the hearing.

11

One of the DHS exhibits contained a certificate of authenticity from the ICTY and a written declaration signed by the custodian of the records, which would have established the admissibility of this document without testimony.

12

While Butler did not separately reference every piece of evidence the DHS submitted, the respondent’s attorney later withdrew his objections to any of the DHS’s evidence, making further explanation of specific documents unnecessary.

13

An Immigration Judge who finds an expert witness qualified to testify may give different weight to the testimony, depending on the extent of the expert’s qualifications or based on other issues regarding the relevance, reliability, and overall probative value of the testimony as to the specific facts in issue in the case. For example, the fact that Butler was employed by the DHS and had worked for the prosecutor at the ICTY could have affected the weight that the Immigration Judge chose to give to his testimony, but it would not have made the testimony inadmissible. See Tun v. Gonzales, 485 F.3d 1014, 1027 (8th Cir. 2007) (stating that involvement in an advocacy organization may affect the weight of an expert’s testimony but is not an adequate basis to exclude it); see also Akinfolarin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that the reasons that an expert’s affidavit was found to lack reliability, which were held to be sufficient to exclude the evidence, could have alternatively been applied to lessen the weight the evidence was given after admitting it). See generally Fed.R.Evid. 702 (discussing relevance of the expert testimony, qualifications of the expert witness, and reliability of the expert opinion).

14

The Fourth Circuit has held that the foreign government documents that Butler testified about in the Federal court case were not inadmissible hearsay because they fell within the hearsay exception of Rule 803(8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which concerns records and reports of public agencies. United States v. Vidacak, 553 F.3d at 351.

15

The respondent also argues that Gardner, who testified regarding the respondent’s omission on his refugee application, should not have been permitted to testify because he did not process the respondent’s application and had no knowledge of the respondent’s case, other than reviewing his refugee application at the hearing. However, as a United States Government official with significant experience in refugee processing, Gardner was qualified to testify as an expert and to give an opinion as to whether certain facts, if known, would have influenced the Government’s decision whether to grant the application. See United States v. Matsumaru, 244 F.3d at 1101-02.

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **
 
U.S. Department of Justice
Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: HIMANSHU PATEL
File: AXXX XX3 862 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Suresh H. Dalal, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Section 216(c)(4) waiver; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of India, appeals the April 14, 2009, denial of his application for a waiver under section 216(c)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4). The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent became a conditional permanent resident of this country on September 11, 1998, by virtue of his June 20, 1997, marriage to a United States citizen (I.J. at 3). The respondent and his ex-wife divorced on March 30, 2001, leading him to file an application for a section 216(c)(4) waiver with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) (I.J. at 3-4; Exh. 2). On June 30, 2003, the District Director terminated his status, concluding that he married his ex-wife for the purpose of procuring entry into the United States (I.J. at 1-2; Exh. 3). The respondent subsequently renewed his application before the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent’s testimony, the testimony of his two supporting witnesses, and his documentary evidence did not establish that he entered into his marriage in good faith (I.J. at 3-10). See 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(e)(2).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that his former attorney provided him ineffective assistance of counsel and requests a remand for consideration of evidence that the attorney allegedly failed to submit. Specifically, the respondent asserts that he retained David K. Wenger, an attorney based in Detroit, MI, to seek reconsideration of USCIS’s denial of his section 216(c)(4) waiver application, and later to procure reopening after the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order on October 19, 2006. He claims that Mr. Wenger lost the following documents that were included with his USCIS request for reconsideration: (1) affidavits of his ex-wife; (2) affidavits of his ex-wife’s father; (3) an affidavit of his ex-wife’s uncle; (4) an affidavit from another of his ex-wife’s uncles; (5) an affidavit of his father; (6) an affidavit of his ex-wife stating that she married the respondent in good faith; (7) an affidavit of the respondent himself; (8) copies of letters sent to the respondent by his ex-wife; and (9) copies of 1998 and 2000 joint tax returns. Moreover, once reopening was granted, Mr. Wenger engaged the services of Robert Frank, an attorney located in Newark, NJ, at the last minute. Mr. Frank was not in possession of the abovementioned evidence while representing the respondent during the final hearing.
 
*2 In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that a motion to reopen (or in this case a motion to remand) based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639; see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 133 (3d Cir. 2001). Here, the respondent has fully complied with these requirements.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. In this regard, the respondent has submitted a copy of a July 6, 2007, letter addressed to him, in which Mr. Wenger admits that he misplaced the respondent’s Form I-751 (USCIS section 216(c)(4) waiver application) file. The record also contains multiple letters from Mr. Wenger to the respondent, in which former counsel calls attention to the pretrial deadline for submitting documentary evidence. The respondent further includes copies of emails that he sent to Mr. Wenger on March 6, 2008, July 2, 2008, and February 19, 2009, asking him to make sure the documentation submitted to USCIS would be available at his Immigration Court hearing. Finally, he provides copies of various pieces of evidence that were not filed in a timely fashion.
 
In denying a section 216(c)(4) waiver, the Immigration Judge emphasized the absence of documentary evidence of a bona fide marriage (I.J. at 8-10). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent has shown prejudice from Mr. Wenger’s failure to produce the pieces of evidence noted above. We will remand the record for the parties to submit additional evidence and argument regarding the bona fides of the respondent’s marriage to his ex-wife. The Immigration Judge should then enter a new decision regarding the respondent’s application for a waiver under section 216(c)(4) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The denial of a section 216(c)(4) waiver is vacated and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
