IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margarita I. Cimadevilla
Assistant Chief Counssel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Barbados, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 16, 2009. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). If the Board determines that an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, it may review de novo whether the facts are sufficient to meet an applicable legal standard. See Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 497 (BIA 2008). We have conducted de novo review of the issues presented here.
 
As found by the Immigration Judge, the respondent was admitted to the United States as an immigrant December 2, 1984. On April 1, 2009, the respondent was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to sell or deliver in violation of section 893.13(1)(a)(2) of the Florida Statutes Annotated.¿FN1º
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is subject to removal as charged.¿FN2º The respondent’s crime, possession of marijuana for sale or delivery, is a controlled substance violation and qualifies as an aggravated felony offense because it is comparable to the federal crime of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. See Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 49, 53-57 (2006) (a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), if the offense would be punishable as a felony under the CSA, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.); 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (making distribution of marijuana unlawful); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) (a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) is a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years).
 
*2 The respondent’s aggravated felony conviction renders her ineligible for any discretionary relief, and she expressed no fear of returning to Barbados. Therefore, it does not appear that there is any relief from removal available to the respondent. The respondent has waived all applications for relief in any event (Tr. at 14).
 
We note that the respondent appears to make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. However, she has failed to comply with the procedural requirements for such claims set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has also failed to demonstrate that she has been prejudiced by any action or inaction of former counsel.¿FN3º See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). To the extent that the respondent maintains that she did not commit the criminal offense which serves as the basis for removal, we note that the Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and will not go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding guilt or innocence. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Footnotes

1

Although the criminal court withheld adjudication of guilt after the respondent entered a plea of “guilty,” the judgment qualifies as a conviction for immigration purposes. See Resendiz-Alcaraz v. United States Att’y Gen., 383 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir. 2004). The evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal would not change this determination, and therefore provides no basis for reopening proceedings. See Matter of Coehlo, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).

2

The respondent claims on appeal that she is a United States citizen and, by implication, not subject to removal. However, the respondent informed the Immigration Court that her father became a naturalized citizen after she became 18 years old (Tr. at 16). Therefore, the respondent could not have derived citizenship through her father’s naturalization. See former section 321(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a).

3

The respondent’s appeal appears to reflect a mistaken belief that the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Court is also her counsel on appeal. However, no attorney has entered an appearance before the Board on the respondent’s behalf.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pamela Lindmark, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance by his prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion and it is therefore deemed unopposed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion complies with the procedural steps for asserting a proper ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). Further, the respondent has satisfactorily established that he was precluded from presenting an application for relief under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), because his prior counsel failed to timely file the application. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (requiring a showing of prejudice in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). We therefore find that he has suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance from his counsel. Accordingly, the motion is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose G. Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jose A. Rivera-Ortiz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen and native of the Dominican Republic, appeals the May 2, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
A hearing was held before the Immigration Judge on March 10, 2008, to consider the respondent’s Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751). According to the parties and the Immigration Judge, this hearing concluded early when the respondent, through her then counsel, requested voluntary departure. By an order dated March 10, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s Form I-751 but granted her 60 days voluntary departure.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent argues that she had ineffective assistance of counsel at the March 2008 hearing. Specifically, she claims that her former counsel did not allow her to fully present her case, and requested voluntary departure before consulting her or obtaining her consent (Motion to Reopen at 1). However, in making this allegation, the respondent has failed to meet any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). That is, she has failed, even on appeal, to submit an affidavit detailing the agreement she had with her former counsel, assert that the former counsel has been informed of the allegations leveled against him and been given an opportunity to respond, or confirm that a bar complaint has been filed against the former counsel, or alternatively, explain why such a complaint has not been filed. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; Punzalan v. Holder, 575 F.3d 107, 109 n.1(1st Cir. 2009).
 
*2 Further, in the absence of egregious circumstances, an alien is bound by the “reasonable tactical actions” of his or her counsel. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995). Based on the very limited detail contained in the respondent’s allegations, we are unable to conclude that her former counsel’s actions were egregious. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (holding that there is a strong presumption that a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity is a reasonable tactical decision).
 
In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel H. Malvin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on May 21, 2009, when we sustained the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) appeal from an Immigration Judge’s December 23, 2008, decision granting the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). On November 30, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that his removal proceedings should be reopened because his former attorney failed to adequately represent him on appeal before the Board. Although his prior counsel filed an appellate brief, the respondent argues that he should have replied to the DHS’s subsequent brief in order to challenge the allegations made therein.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the instant case, the respondent’s motion would have been due on or before August 19, 2009. However, the respondent did not file his motion to reopen until November 30, 2009.
 
For an alien raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the untimeliness of the motion may possibly be excused under the doctrine of equitable tolling if the alien establishes that he exercised due diligence. See Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1095-97 (9th Cir. 2007). However, we find that the respondent has not exercised due diligence in this case. The respondent was aware of the representation provided by his prior counsel before the Board, but waited more than 6 months to file his motion. These facts do not support a finding that the respondent has acted with due diligence. Consequently, we find that the respondent’s motion is not subject to equitable tolling and is denied as untimely.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on July 14, 2009. By a decision of that date, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed on January 12, 2009, which sought reopening based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but reissued the Board decision of April 27, 2007, in order to allow the respondent the opportunity to exercise an appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion seeking reconsideration of the July 14, 2009, decision. By the motion, the respondent avers, inter alia, that the Board failed to address the application for adjustment of status that accompanied the motion to reopen.
 
The respondent’s January 12, 2009, motion was accompanied by an application for adjustment of status based upon the respondent’s August 11, 2008, marriage to a United States citizen. The motion also referenced the possibility of adjustment through the respondent’s adult United States citizen child. Upon further consideration of the documentation of record, the motion for reconsideration will be granted to allow the respondent to apply for adjustment of status.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

File: AXXX XX7 334 - Fishkill, NY
January 28, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
C. Cullen Sheppard
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In a decision dated September 29, 2009, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable; determined that he did not apply for, and did not demonstrate eligibility for, any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Jamaica. The respondent appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed. The request for oral argument is denied.
 
The respondent was found removable on the four charged grounds, as in the United States in violation of law under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B); as convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, in conjunction with both sections 101(a)(43)(F) and 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(F) and 1101(a)(43)(G); and as convicted of a controlled substance violation under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. As substantiated by conviction documents (Ex. 3), he has New York convictions upon guilty pleas on November 24, 2008, for assault in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, cocaine. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 5 years, 5 years, and 1 year for these crimes, respectively. The record reflects that he arrived in the United States in 2002.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he fears returning to Jamaica because he could be killed by the same unidentified individuals who murdered his sister, brother-in-law, and uncle (Br. at 1 et seq.).
 
We observe that the respondent’s assault and robbery convictions are for both aggravated felonies and particularly serious crimes. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 1158(b)(2)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(4) and 1208.16(d)(2) and (3) (2009). As an alien who has been convicted of at least one offense that is a particularly serious crime as well as an aggravated felony, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding under the Act and is eligible only for deferral of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). In addition, we note that the respondent’s convictions for the assault and robbery offenses are for crimes that are per se particularly serious, since he has been sentenced to imprisonment of at least 5 years for each of those offenses. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act; see also section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B).
 
*2 With respect to CAT, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent abandoned such application for failure to timely submit it by the deadline of September 25, 2009, following his final removal hearing on August 12, 2009 (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 11). Concerning the respondent’s present claim of torture, we find that he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for deferral of removal under the CAT at this time, based on his cursory and unsubstantiated allegations regarding his fear of returning to Jamaica.
 
Next on appeal, the respondent asserts that he will face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon his removal (Br. at 4-5). To the extent that he seeks to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), he is statutorily ineligible for that relief because he cannot establish the necessary 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States dating from his 2002 arrival and because he has been convicted of offenses under section 237(a)(2) of the Act. See section 240A(b)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act. His period of continuous physical presence was deemed to end in October 2006, when he committed the robbery crime. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act; Ex. 3. We therefore need not and do not reach consideration of whether he can meet the other section 240A(b) requirements, including whether he can demonstrate that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his spouse, parent, or child who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, as required under section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. We observe that extreme hardship to an alien himself is no longer considered under section 240A(b) of the Act, although it was relevant to whether a respondent could establish eligibility for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a), which provision the respondent has referenced (Br. at 4).
 
To the extent that the respondent wishes to apply for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Act, we note that he cannot do so in these removal proceedings, following the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-627 (“IIRIRA”). If IIRIRA had never been enacted and the respondent were in deportation proceedings, he might have submitted an application for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a)(1) of the Act. Former section 244(a)(1) required only 7 years of continuous physical presence, included the lower standard of extreme hardship, and permitted extreme hardship to the alien himself to be considered. However, we reiterate that suspension of deportation is a form of relief that is not available to the respondent in the current removal proceedings. The respondent appropriately was placed in removal proceedings because the proceedings for him were commenced with the service of the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) on February 18, 2009, which date is nearly 12 years subsequent to April 1, 1997, the general effective date of IIRIRA. To the extent that the respondent is challenging the timing of the institution of his removal proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to second-guess the decision of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to initiate removal proceedings by serving the NTA on February 18, 2009. The determination to place an alien in proceedings is a matter of prosecutorial discretion entirely within the authority of the DHS. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); see also Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 48 (BIA 1982).
 
*3 The respondent also has referenced section 240A(b)(2) of the Act (Br. at 3), which pertains to “special rule” cancellation for a battered spouse or child. However, he has not presented any probative evidence to demonstrate that he is prima facie eligible for relief under such provision.
 
We do not find that a remand is warranted for consideration of any claim for CAT deferral, any claim for cancellation of removal, or for any other reason in this case.
 
In a supplementary appellate submission, the respondent contends that his legal representative failed to assist him with filing a CAT application in Immigration Court. To the extent that the respondent asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his removal proceedings, he has failed to offer any evidence that substantially complies with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he further has failed to demonstrate that he suffered the requisite prejudice from counsel’s alleged inaction, such that a remand for consideration of his claim would be warranted. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges that his removal proceedings were unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in handling his hearings. We also find that he has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would affect the outcome of his case and would amount to a due process violation. See Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1014 (1994). To the extent that the respondent alleges that certain provisions of the immigration laws are unconstitutional, we observe that this Board cannot rule on the constitutionality of laws enacted by Congress. See Matter of Fuentes-Campos, 21 I&N Dec. 905 (BIA 1997).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent maybe seeking humanitarian relief to enable him to stay in the United States, we recognize that this Board and the Immigration Judges have limited jurisdiction and can grant only those forms of relief from removal that are expressly authorized by Congress. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). We have no power to grant equitable remedies or to confer general humanitarian relief on aliens, even though a particular case may pose sympathetic circumstances. If the respondent wishes to obtain relief on humanitarian grounds, he must pursue such relief with the DHS.
 
*4 Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Manuel Rivera, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leslie Smith Turner
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the July 17, 2008, decision of an Immigration Judge denying her motion to reconsider. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record indicates that the respondent was granted voluntary departure on March 6, 2000, at the conclusion of removal proceedings, with an alternate order of removal to El Salvador. In March 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge concluded that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit, and the motion was denied as untimely filed. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The denial of that motion to reconsider is the subject of this appeal.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec.493 (BIA 2008).
 
Based on our standard of review, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reconsider. The respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based, not on new evidence or information that was recently discovered, but on facts that were well established at the conclusion of her proceedings on March 6, 2000. The respondent has not shown due diligence in filing the motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien). Furthermore, the respondent did not meet the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An affidavit was not submitted with the motion to reopen, and was only submitted with the motion to reconsider. Prior counsel was apparently not notified, and no explanation for the failure to file a bar complaint was included. Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated in his decision that respondent has not shown how counsel’s apparent lack of preparation caused the respondent to lie at the hearing. Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Emmanuel Ahia, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, appeals from the November 3, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on October 14, 2008, and reopen proceedings. The respondent has filed an appeal brief; the Department of Homeland Security has not. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
Subsequent to the entry of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent retained new counsel. On appeal, the respondent asserts for the first time claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against two of her prior attorneys of record, Jennifer Klapper, Esquire, and Gary T. Jodha, Esquire.¿FN1º
 
Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by the standards found in our precedent decision Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). The United States Court of Appeal for the Third Circuit (under whose jurisdiction the instant case arises) has cautioned against a strict interpretation of the Lozada requirements, noting that the case “serve¿sº as a threshold and a screening mechanism to help the agency assess the substantial number of ineffective assistance claims it receives.” Rranci v. Att’y Gen., 540 F.3d 165, 173 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Fadiga v. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 142, 155 (3d Cir. 2007).
 
We find that attorney Jodha’s failure to inform the respondent of the date of her hearing (and to make adequate efforts to ascertain such date) constituted ineffective assistance. We additionally find that the respondent has satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Although the respondent herself did not notify Mr. Jodha of the allegations (as required by the second prong of Lozada), we find such requirement to have been satisfied. In a correspondence dated October 21, the Immigration Judge requested Mr. Jodha to inform her as to whether he had in fact substituted as the respondent’s counsel by October 14, 2008, and was “already in possession of the client file” by that date. The Immigration Judge continued that if so, “Mr. Jodha evidently owed Respondent the duty to determine the date, place, and time of the next scheduled hearing because because he had obtained her file and Respondent had already advised former counsel to stop working on Respondent’s case.”
 
*2 Attorney Jodha responded in writing on October 31, 2008. As attorney of record, Mr. Jodha also received the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2008, decision, in which she determined that there was “a lack of evidence that Mr. Jodha…made reasonable effort to determine the status of this case” (I.J. at 4). Upon review of the entire record, we find no clear error in such determination. As the present allegations of ineffective assistance by Mr. Jodha are identical to the issues already raised in the Immigration Judge’s October 14, 2008, correspondence and her November 3, 2008, decision, we find that prior counsel received adequate notice and the opportunity to respond. See Rranci v. Att’y Gen., supra.
 
As we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that she and her firm “were both diligent to the Respondent” (I.J. at 4), we find no ineffective assistance by Ms. Klapper.
 
Based on the finding of ineffective assistance by Mr. Jodha, we will rescind the in absentia order of removal. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The order of removal is rescinded, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative order in this case was issued by the Board on December 15, 2003, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s May 3, 2002, decision finding the respondent, a native and citizen of India, removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act and denying him relief from removal on discretionary grounds. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review in 2005. Respondent’s motion at 5. Nearly six years after the final administrative order, on November 30, 2009, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen renewing his request to pursue adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent does not dispute the untimeliness of the motion, but argues that the deadline should either be equitably tolled or alternatively that we reopen sua sponte. We will deny the motion.
 
There is no issue regarding the respondent’s inadmissibility as charged pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Rather, the respondent argues that the two counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal were ineffective in failing to establish his eligibility for section 245(i) relief, which he argues was denied based on the Immigration Judge’s erroneous finding that he is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i).
 
However, contrary to the respondent’s arguments, the Immigration Judge simply noted the basis for the former Immigration and Naturalization Service’s denial of his application and did not make an independent finding that any of the section 212(a)(9) statutory bars to admission apply. Rather, Immigration Judge found that the equities presented in this case were outweighed not only by the respondent’s repeated immigration violations, but also the disingenuous nature of his representations regarding his residency and immigration history (including his use of a different name which resulted in the assignment of a different alien number after his illegal reentry) and his lack of candor and forthrightness with the court. The Immigration Judge therefore found that the respondent was not deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion and denied, on discretionary grounds, even the minimal relief of voluntary departure. We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s assessment of the respondent’s discretionary factors would change if these proceedings were reopened for further consideration of the respondent’s adjustment of status application. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (a party who files a motion to remand or a motion to reopen bears a “heavy burden” of proving that “if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all of the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case”). We likewise find that the respondent has not demonstrated that he is worthy of a favorable exercise of discretion. Rather than providing new favorable equities, the late motion compounds the respondent’s prior immigration violations by showing a continued disregard for the final removal order. The Sixth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review in 2005. See I.N.S. v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988) (holding that the Board “may leap ahead, as it were, over two threshold concerns (prima facie case and new evidence/reasonable explanation), and simply determine that even if they were met, movant would not be entitled to discretionary grant of relief”).
 
*2 Finally, we add that the failure to argue that a section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) bar did not apply, and that the former Immigration and Naturalization Service had thus incorrectly calculated the period of the respondent’s illegal presence by measuring the length of his illegal presence after his last departure, does not constitute “egregious” ineffectiveness given the undeveloped state of the law regarding the section 212(a)(9)(B) bars at the relevant times. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (“Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, absent egregious circumstances.”). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). We point out that our decision in Matter of Rodarte-Roman, 23 I&N Dec. 905 (BIA 2006), which clarified that the requisite period of illegal presence must occur prior to the departure, was not issued until well after our dismissal of the respondent’s appeal in 2003. We therefore find that untimely reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance is not warranted here. We also decline to exercise our discretion to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the rules governing motions are intended to bring finality to proceedings and the Board’s sua sponte authority is not meant to be used as a cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might cause hardship).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John Nguyen, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a male native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 22, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on March 26, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent reiterates that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing because his former counsel did not inform him of the specific date and time of his hearing. Upon de novo review, we find that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge reopened proceedings on two prior occasions after the respondent failed to appear. Following the Immigration Judge’s decision reopening the respondent’s case a second time, a hearing notice dated July 31, 2007, was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record, Deok J. Kim, Esquire. See Exh. 15. We find that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorney of record. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent concedes in his brief that his attorney appeared at his hearing without the respondent, indicating that the hearing notice was received by Mr. Kim. The fact that his attorney was allowed to withdraw on the day of the respondent’s last hearing is irrelevant to the issue of proper notice. To the extent that the respondent argues exceptional circumstances because his attorney did not tell him the date and time of his hearing, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy any of the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We are also not persuaded by the respondent’s argument on appeal that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear which indicates that he received oral notice in his native Spanish of the consequences of failing to appear for his removal hearing, he is therefore statutorily ineligible for such relief See section 240(b)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7). See also Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (explaining that an in absentia deportation order need not always be rescinded before it can be reopened).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rhonda F. Gelfman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christina M. Martyak
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 3, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On September 1, 2009, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent contends that his former counsel, Ariol Eugene, provided ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge and has refused to provide him with a copy of his file. The respondent was represented by different counsel before the Board.
 
The respondent requests that the Board grant his motion to reopen, motion for extension of time to comply with his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and motion for a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security objects to the granting of the motion.
 
The respondent has not submitted any supplemental evidence since the filing of the original motion. The original motion does not demonstrate that the respondent complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), with respect to Mr. Eugene. Further, although the respondent generally alleges that he was denied his right to counsel and due process based on ineffective assistance, he has not identified any particular instances of ineffective assistance of counsel or demonstrated prejudice. Accordingly, the motions are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gregory Fehlings
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appeals the September 16, 2009, Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen following the October 16, 2000, issuance of an in absentia order of removal in her case. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act; Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999). The respondent’s motion to reopen included a declaration asserting that the respondent had “received no … documents to warn ¿herº of any immigration violations.” The Immigration Judge denied the motion based upon his findings that the respondent (1) had been personally served with the Notice to Appear (NTA) (Exh. 1), which included a warning regarding any failure to appear and the respondent’s statutory change-of-address obligation, and (2) had made no claims in her declaration as to her correct address at the time of her missed hearing and any efforts she had made to comply with her statutory address obligations.
 
We recently held in Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674 (BIA 2008), that
¿iºn determining whether a respondent has rebutted the weaker presumption of delivery applicable ¿where a notice of hearing is sent to the respondent by regular mail, as opposed to certified mailº, an Immigration Judge may consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the respondent’s affidavit; (2) affidavits from family members or other individuals who are knowledgeable about the facts relevant to whether notice was received; (3) the respondent’s actions upon learning of the in absentia order, and whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation; (4) any prior affirmative application for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (5) any prior application for relief filed with the Immigration Court or any prima facie evidence in the record or the respondent’s motion of statutory eligibility for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (6) the respondent’s previous attendance at Immigration Court hearings, if applicable; and (7) any other circumstances or evidence indicating possible nonreceipt of notice. We emphasize that these are just examples of the types of evidence that can support a motion to reopen. Immigration Judges are neither required to deny reopening if exactly such evidence is not provided nor obliged to grant a motion, even if every type of evidence is submitted. Each case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.
 
 
*2 The Immigration Judge’s findings that the respondent was personally served with the NTA,¿FN1º had been sent her notice of hearing (Exh. 2) at the same address listed on the NTA, and made no representations as to her correct address at the time of the hearing notice’s issuance are not clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The record contains no evidence that the respondent had attended an earlier immigration hearing, had an available form of relief from removal,¿FN2º or had informed the immigration court of any change of address. Applying a de novo standard of review, we conclude that, given these facts, the respondent’s declaration’s inaccurate and unspecific claim that she received no documents with regard to her removal proceedings is insufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery of the mailed notice of her October 16, 2000, hearing.
 
On appeal the respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by asserting that prior counsel sub-contracted with another attorney to file her motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge; that the filing attorney failed to point out in the motion that an immigrant visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent was pending; that the filing attorney “failed to argue to the Court that the disgruntled ex-husband controlled the dwelling where the notice was sent and could have received the notice by way of the woman he was then living with thus depriving the Respondent of notice;” that the filing attorney failed to submit applications for relief with the motion to reopen; that the filing attorney failed to investigate the fact that the respondent had applied for United States citizenship; that the filing attorney failed to provide the Immigration Judge with “a proper reason” for the respondent’s prior failure to appear, specifically that the respondent had lost her immigration documents when she was forced to leave her husband’s home; and that the filing attorney failed to file an appeal or to alert the respondent of the need to file an appeal.
 
Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. The respondent has not complied with the first two of these requirements.
 
*3 Even if the respondent had met all of these requirements, however, we would nevertheless find that her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. First, in the absence of an affidavit by the respondent as to her agreement with her first attorney, she cannot establish that she had an agreement with him, much less that he failed to comply with the agreement by hiring another attorney to prepare the motion. Second, the respondent has not shown that an immigrant visa petition was pending on her behalf at the time of her missed 2000 hearing or that she was eligible to apply for naturalization, and therefore filing counsel cannot be found incompetent for not raising such claims. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005). Third, even if the respondent had shown that she was eligible to apply for some form of relief at the time that the motion to reopen was filed, the failure to submit applications for relief would result in no prejudice to the respondent, see Mohammed v. Gonzales, supra, at 793-94, unless the respondent could first demonstrate that she had not received notice of her missed hearing, as would be required to rescind the in absentia order of removal under section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. Fourth, the respondent’s claim that she failed to appear at her 2000 hearing because she did not receive notice due to having left her home, where her husband remained with a girlfriend, does not explain why she failed to file a change of address form, as instructed in her NTA. Finally, an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen was in fact filed, and therefore the respondent suffered no prejudice by prior counsel’s alleged failure to file or to alert her of the need to file. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, supra.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In his December 7, 2009, brief, counsel repeatedly asserts that the respondent was not served with the NTA. However, the Certificate of Service box on the NTA (Exh. 1) contains a signature by the respondent acknowledging personal receipt. The NTA included a warning regarding any failure to appear and the respondent’s statutory change-of-address obligation. Counsel asserts on appeal that the respondent was not advised in Spanish of the consequences of a failure to appear, but (1) he has not cited any statute or regulation requiring such translation; and (2) the respondent has not claimed that any such lack of translation was the reason for her failure to appear.

The respondent’s and counsel’s assertions that the respondent was eligible for various forms of relief from removal are not evidence.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China, appeals from the January 5, 2009, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia order entered on May 21, 2008, and reopen proceedings. Both parties have filed appeal briefs. The record will be remanded.
 
We review factual findings of the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We may review questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other non-fact issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 497 (BIA 2008).
 
On November 21, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge that was prepared by his prior counsel, Liu Yu. The motion alleged ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Yu’s own office, but argued that it was not necessary for him to comply with all of the requirements for establishing such grounds under our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º The Immigration Judge rejected such argument, and denied the motion for failure to fully comply with the requirements of Lozada (I.J. at 4-5).
 
The respondent retained new counsel on appeal, who filed a second motion to reopen with this Board on March 3, 2009, and an appeal brief on March 25, 2009.¿FN2º The second motion was accompanied by additional evidence intended to fully comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. The Department of Homeland Security responded with a brief arguing that such motion is numerically barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3).
 
Pursuant to our de novo review, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. However, we will deem the second motion to reopen (which was filed during the pendency of the respondent’s appeal) as a motion to remand. In light of the unusual circumstances presented here, we deem it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence in the first instance and determine whether rescission is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for issuance of a new order not inconsistent with the foregoing decision.

In arguing that it was not necessary to comply with the requirement under Matter of Lozada, supra, of filing a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority, prior counsel claimed that the purpose of such requirement “is to prevent aliens or their counsel of ineffective assistance counsel from the collusive of the reopen proceedings. There is no such collusive ¿sicº.” Motion to Reopen at 2.

In his appeal brief, the respondent relied on the precedent decision of the Attorney General in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), which was published 2 days subsequent to the entry of the Immigration Judge’s order in this case. We note that the Compean decision was vacated in a decision of the Attorney General dated June 3, 2009. Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 26, 2008, decision finding she did not have jurisdiction to review his motion to reopen. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen directly with the Board. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s case was last before the Board on September 21, 2005. Therefore, the respondent was required to file his motion to reopen with the Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Consequently, the Immigration Judge properly found that she did not have jurisdiction over the merits of the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is both untimely and numerically barred, as outlined in the regulations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). To be timely, the respondent’s motion would have been due on or before September 21, 2005. See id (imposing, in general, a 90-day deadline for motions to reopen). However, this motion to reopen was filed on February 19, 2008. Additionally, this is the respondent’s fifth request for reopening, and we have previously denied motions to reopen in the instant case filed by him through orders issued by the Board on October 11, 2005, April 23, 2007, July 24, 2007, and September 19, 2007. As a result, the respondent has exceeded the single motion to reopen limit imposed by regulation. See id.
 
In his motion, the respondent maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who initially represented him before the Immigration Court and the Board and an attorney who subsequently represented him before the Board in filing a motion to reopen based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his first attorney. In particular, he maintains that the first attorney erred in seeking a continuance on his behalf rather than asserting his eligibility for adjustment of status and in failing to completely advise him of his rights and responsibilities pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure. The respondent argues that the second attorney failed to timely file a motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance.
 
*2 Although the respondent has met the procedural requirement for ineffective assistance outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we find that he has not established that he was prejudiced by his prior counsels’ actions. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993) (requiring the respondent to demonstrate “substantial prejudice” in order to establish a due process violation). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra. This requires a showing that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
As we noted in our July 24, 2007, decision, the respondent failed to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his ineffective assistance claim against his first attorney. Moreover, although he cites this attorney’s decision to seek voluntary departure on his behalf as legal error, the respondent’s dissatisfaction with his former counsel’s strategy in pursuing relief is not a ground for reopening based on ineffective assistance. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998). Finally, the respondent fails to show prejudice as a result of his first attorney’s allegedly ineffective representation, as he was not eligible for relief when the administratively final order was entered.
 
The respondent alleges that his second attorney failed to act with due haste or diligence in pursuing his ineffective assistance claim against his prior counsel, but he has failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice. He asserts that he is eligible to adjust status as an alien grandfathered under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Specifically, he asserts that this eligibility arises from a labor certification filed on behalf of Nighat Sultana on April 30, 2001, and that Ms. Sultana is his mother. However, the respondent has not provided documentary evidence of his qualifying relationship with Ms. Sultana. As a result, the respondent has failed to provide prima facie evidence that he is a grandfathered alien, and thus, he has failed to demonstrate prejudice as a result of his second attorney’s alleged ineffective performance.
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On June 15, 2009, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, filed her fourth motion to reopen since we issued a final administrative order in this case on December 30, 2004.
 
Because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent’s cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), was denied on September 19, 2003, for lack of the requisite 10-year period of continuous physical presence. The respondent now claims that Mario Lemus, who was posing as a lawyer, told her to change all the dates that she had been in the United States. See Motion at 2. We find equitable tolling is not warranted here since the respondent has failed to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her case. She has known for years that she was misadvised by Mr. Lemus. She failed to explain her failure to raise this allegation earlier. The respondent claims that she informed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of Mr. Lemus’ actions. See Respondent’s Motion at 3. Yet, she provides no documentation establishing that she did so.
 
The respondent also asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent asserts that her children, one of whom is a 22-year-old United States citizen, will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if they are forced to accompany her to Mexico. See Respondent’s Motion at 4-8. The respondent has not offered any documentation in support of her motion. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992) (motion to reopen may be denied based upon the failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought). Nor has she established her prima facie eligibility for any form of relief from removal.¿FN1º The respondent has failed to present exceptional circumstances which would support sua sponte reopening under the standards set forth in Matter of J-J-, supra. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion is denied as time and number barred.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jon D. Staples
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)º-Crime involving moral turpitude

Sec. 212(a)(9)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)º- Previously ordered removed at arrival
 
  
APPLICATION: Relief
 
The respondent has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s September 1, 2009, decision, finding him removable, as charged, based on his admissions (Tr. at 3), and record of convictions, and statutorily ineligible for relief from removal. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2009); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon our de novo review of the issues presented here, we have concluded that the respondent presents no arguments on appeal that would cause us to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision.¿FN1º Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions in this case (Tr. at 3). See section 240(c)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(2)(A). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal, including a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). See also section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Furthermore, to the extent the respondent seeks to challenge his previous order of removal dated January 20, 2005, which was executed on March 14, 2005, now alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel, neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board has jurisdiction to consider the issue. The respondent has not shown that he ever raised the issue of ineffective assistance of former counsel in the former proceedings prior to his removal, or complied with the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting out the requirements that would support a motion to reopen based on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent has not demonstrated that his removal from the United States in 2005, was not made pursuant to a lawful order of deportation. With limited exceptions not applicable here, the departure of an alien from the United States pursuant to a lawful order of deportation has the effect of depriving either the Immigration Judge or this Board of jurisdiction over the prior proceedings. See Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008) (holding that the Board lacks authority to reopen removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings if the alien has departed the United States after those administrative proceedings have been completed); Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281, 288 (BIA 1998); Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864, 865 (BIA 1994); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d) and 1003.23(b)(1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Saadia Siddique, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Debra Robinson
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on June 5, 2009, when we found that the respondent had filed, and then withdrawn, a motion to reopen his proceedings. Previously, in a decision dated June 11, 2008, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 29, 2007, denial of his motion to reopen his in absentia proceedings. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen on May 20, 2009. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he received from the attorneys who represented him before the Immigration Court and this Board. Specifically, the respondent argues, first, that his prior attorney, Mr. Yang, Esquire, failed to inform the respondent that he was required to appear in court, and that this ineffective advice resulted in his in absentia order, his inability to request relief in the form of adjustment of status, and the loss of his opportunity to request voluntary departure. The respondent also argues that his second attorney, Mr. Cianciolo prejudiced Mr. Multani by inadequately representing him in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, and by failing, in the motion to reopen, to include an argument regarding Mr. Yang’s ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º The respondent further argues that Mr. Cianciolo compounded his ineffective assistance by filing an appeal from the denial of this motion, which was dismissed by the Board on June 11, 2008.
 
In support of his motion, the respondent has filed an affidavit outlining his allegations, as well as letters to his previous attorneys, letters to the Iowa Supreme Court making known his grievances, and a response from Mr. Yang, Esquire. While the respondent has substantially complied with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we agree with the DHS’ argument that the respondent has not indicated that he filed this motion with due diligence. See Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858 (8th Cir. 2006). The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in June of 2008, and the respondent attests, in his affidavit, that “he did not trust (Ms. Cianciolo) at that point” so he did not proceed with any further legal contract with her. Therefore, the respondent has lost confidence in Ms. Cianciolo at some point prior to mid-2008, and yet the respondent did not pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim until a year later, in May of 2009. We also note that the Immigration Judge recognized, in his denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in 2007, that “it (was) somewhat unusual that the respondent did not apparently contact his attorney (Mr. Yang) following the November 8, 2005 hearing to determine the date of his next hearing rather than waiting nearly two years to file a motion to reopen alleging ‘exceptional circumstances beyond his control’ (for purposes of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii)). The respondent does not explain the reason for either of these delays, except to say that he assumed that because his “labor certification was pending, (the hearing) was still ongoing.”
 
*2 Accordingly, we do not find that the respondent has filed this motion with due diligence, and we, thus, find no merit to the respondent’s motion, and no reason to except the motion from the timeliness requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s September 1, 2009, decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, concluding, inter alia, that the respondent’s February 5, 2009, conviction for the felony offense of second-degree assault in violation of section 120.05 of the NEW YORK PENAL LAW was final for immigration purposes. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The sole issue on appeal is whether a conviction is final for immigration purposes where a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal pursuant to Section 460.30 of the NEW YORK CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW has been submitted to Supreme Court of the State of New York.¿FN1º As noted above, the respondent, in February 2009, was convicted of the felony offense of second-degree assault in violation of section 120.05 of the NEW YORK PENAL LAW. On or about August 28, 2009, he filed a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal pursuant to Section 460.30 of the NEW YORK CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW. The respondent’s motion was pending before the Supreme Court of the State of New York at the time of his removal hearing (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 10), and apparently remains pending.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard, and the Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i) and (ii). Upon our de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s conviction is considered final for immigration purposes. This Board has recently held that a conviction is final for immigration purposes where a defendant files a motion for permission to file a late appeal pursuant to Section 460.30 of the NEW YORK CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW. See Matter of Cardenas-Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795 (BIA 2009). Accordingly, the respondent’s conviction for assault in the second degree remains final for immigration purposes. Thus, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
*2 The following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that no specific allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel have been made on appeal, although the respondent has indicated that in proceedings before the Immigration Judge he was abandoned by his attorney. Moreover, the record shows that, after the Immigration Judge granted the attorney’s motion to withdraw, the respondent, when asked by the Immigration Judge if he wanted time to look for a new attorney, expressed his desire to represent himself (Tr. at 10).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lymari Casta, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge A. Ramos
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 26, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent maintains that his counsel informed him that he did not need to appear for his hearing, inasmuch as his hearing had been rescheduled to a different date and time. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find that the respondent has demonstrated that exceptional circumstances prevented the respondent from attending his hearing. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). As the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) recognizes on appeal, the respondent has complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and his motion to reopen was filed within 180 days of the entry of the in absentia order of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent’s counsel committed ineffective assistance, which prevented the respondent from attending his scheduled hearing before the Immigration Judge on May 13, 2008, at 10:30 a.m. The record reflects that the respondent’s counsel made numerous requests for continuances before the Immigration Judge based upon conflicts of schedule and due to the respondent’s pending visa petition (Form 1-130). On the day of the respondent’s scheduled May 13, 2008, hearing, the respondent’s counsel faxed a request for a further continuance to the Immigration Court approximately 2 hours prior to the respondent’s 10:30 a.m. hearing. According to the respondent’s affidavit, he was already traveling to the hearing when he received a telephone call from his counsel’s office informing him that he did not have to appear in Immigration Court that morning, because his hearing had been rescheduled. See R’s brief at Exh. C. However, the Immigration Judge did not grant respondent’s counsel’s motion for a further continuance and ordered the respondent removed in absentia when he failed to appear for his hearing.
 
*2 Inasmuch as the record reflects that the respondent was misinformed by his counsel that he did not need to appear for his May 13, 2008, hearing, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with a hearing regarding the respondent’s removability from the United States and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Abisag Ayala, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rubab Z. Razvi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 29, 2009, decision to deny his untimely motion to reopen. On January 7, 2009, the final administrative order in the respondent’s removal proceeding was entered by the Immigration Judge. On April 16, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. On April 29, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied his motion because the respondent failed to timely file and failed to adequately support his application for cancellation of removal with proper documentation.
 
“¿Aº party may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings (whether before the Board of the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent did not file his motion to reopen within 90 days of the final administrative decision, nor did he file it on or before September 30, 1996. As such, we agree with the Immigration Judge that his motion to reopen the final administrative order is time-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the time limitations for motions to reopen during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing his motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002). The respondent has argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We note that the respondent failed to meet any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and did not show that he had been prejudiced in his prior proceedings. The steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, include, inter alia, that the motion reflect 1) the agreement with counsel; (2) that prior counsel has been notified and afforded an opportunity to respond; and 3) whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Despite the respondent statement that he has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, the record does not support his position. The respondent has not explained the agreement he had with counsel, given counsel notice of the ineffective assistance and an opportunity to respond, nor has the respondent filed any complaint with the appropriate authorities or explained why he failed to do so. See Respondent’s Attachments to Brief on Appeal. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
*2 Moreover, an alien must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought before a motion to reopen will be granted. See, e.g., INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not submit the required documentation to support his prior motion to reopen. Furthermore, the respondent has not filed such documentation on appeal. In the absence of such, the Board cannot consider the respondent’s request for reopening to apply for cancellation of removal as he had not demonstrated statutory eligibility for this relief. Matter of K-L-, 20 I&N Dec. 654, 659 (BIA 1993). Therefore, the respondent has also not demonstrated prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (must show the outcome might have been affected had the negligent representation not occurred).
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on July 22, 2009. The appeal was accordingly due on or before August 21, 2009. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on November 19, 2009. We accordingly find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal the respondent has filed a Motion to File Late Appeal. Respondent states that his former counsel neglected to file his appeal on his behalf. However, he provides no evidence in support of this claim and does not comply with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the motion to accept the late filed appeal is denied. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15. The record before us indicates that the respondent may have waived appeal. In view of our disposition of this case, we need not determine whether the respondent made a knowing and intelligent waiver in this case.
 
We note that because we are dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) & (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) & C of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) & (B) and (c)(7)(A) & C; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

December 11, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
S. Bernard Schwarz, Esquire
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
On February 18, 2005, with the respondent represented by Victor A. Schiano, the Board affirmed a decision of an Immigration Judge finding the respondent, who is from Ecuador, undeserving of relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The Board found, after considering the respondent’s “extensive criminal history that ranged from 1985 through 1992 that resulted in sentences to extensive periods of confinement”, that his equities did not outweigh the negative factors in the respondent’s case. The Board declined to reconsider this decision, on June 27, 2005, with the respondent represented by Donald F. Madeo. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Board’s February 18, 2005, decision in an unpublished order dated April 26, 2007. Rodriguez-Brito v. Gonzales, 223 Fed.Appx. 55, 2007 WL 1233594 (2d Cir. April 26, 2007)(unpublished). The respondent was represented by H. Raymond Fasano, who is associated with Madeo.
 
On September 25, 2007, represented by David W. Guy, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, claiming that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel from Dina Fleissig, an attorney associated with Schiano, who appeared with the respondent at the removal hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen on October 4, 2007. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on April 21, 2009. The Board found, citing Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974), that the respondent was required to file his motion with the Board and the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the motion, inasmuch as the Board issued the final administrative decision on the merits in this case on February 18, 2005.
 
The respondent, now represented by S. Bernard Schwarz, filed an untimely motion to reopen with the Board, on May 14, 2009. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Schiano, Fleissig, and Guy.
 
The respondent provides an inadequate reason for the lateness of the motion. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2008) (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence in pursuing his claim”, citing Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2006)); Wang v. Board of Immigration Appeals, 508 F.3d 710 (2d Cir. 2007)(diligence must be shown by respondent wishing to pursue an untimely motion). The respondent brings claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against Schiano and Fleissig, who represented him before the Immigration Judge at the removal hearing, and on appeal to the Board on February 18, 2005. The respondent also complains that attorney Guy provided ineffective assistance of counsel, by improperly filing the motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on September 25, 2007.
 
*2 The motion neglects to mention, however, that at least between March 21, 2005 (when a motion to reconsider was filed with the Board) and July 19, 2007 (when the Second Circuit denied a petition for rehearing), the respondent was represented by the law firm of Madeo & Fasano, and its attorneys, H. Raymond Fasano and Donald F. Madeo. The pending motion fails to explain why any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could not have been presented by these attorneys during this time period of over 2 years. No claim is made that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from these attorneys.
 
Thus, the respondent fails to show diligence that would justify tolling the motions deadline for such a long period of time. Reopening under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a) is reserved for exceptional situations, which have not been demonstrated here. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The motion to reopen will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Greg Radics
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude (sustained)
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation (sustained)
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document (not sustained)
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 25, 2008, decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1996), abandoned. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
At the October 12, 2005, master calendar hearing, the Immigration Judge reset the hearing for October 30, 2006, so that the respondent could submit his application for relief (Tr. at 4-8). On October 18, 2006, the respondent’s counsel filed a Motion to Withdraw Representation as Attorney, which was granted by the Immigration Judge. For reasons not set forth in the record, the hearing was again reset for July 25, 2008. At the July 25, 2008, hearing, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance and deemed his application for relief abandoned because it had not been filed. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 25, 2008, decision. On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a continuance. Specifically, the respondent argues that his prior counsel failed to inform him of his obligation to file his application for relief.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is considered to have abandoned his claim because he failed to timely file his application for relief from removal (I.J. at 3-4). An Immigration Judge has broad discretion to conduct removal proceedings and to set time limits and extensions for filing applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). In this case, the respondent’s counsel was advised by the Immigration Judge that the application for relief was required to be filed at the next hearing (Tr. at 6). Moreover, as shown above, proceedings in this matter had been delayed to allow the respondent ample time to prepare for his merits hearing. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982) (holding that an Immigration Judge has a duty to determine removability in an expeditious manner and to avoid dilatory tactics designed to delay removal proceedings). To the extent that the respondent alleges that his former counsel engaged in ineffective assistance, we note that the respondent has not attempted to comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed. Reg. 76,927, 937-38 (Dec. 18, 2008) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1)).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 73 Fed. Reg. At 76938 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i)).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria M. Odom, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley Fortson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(C), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C)º - Convicted of firearms or destructive device violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a 37-year-old native and citizen of Mexico, appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 19, 2007, decision denying his motion to reopen to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent’s attorney’s motion to withdraw was granted on February 26, 2007. On March 20, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable, as charged, and that he had abandoned any applications for relief. Through a new attorney, he filed a motion to reopen on June 13, 2007, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal was remanded by the Board on May 22, 2008, to the Immigration Court so that the record file could be located. The record was located and returned to the Board on August 19, 2009. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States on or about December 1, 1990, as a lawful permanent resident. He married a citizen of Mexico on February 24, 2002, in Mexico. They have five United States citizen children ages 19, 16, 11, 10 and 6 years old. He was convicted in Cobb County, Georgia, on or about June 3, 1997, on a plea of guilty of carrying a concealed weapon. He was fined and given a 12 month suspended sentence. The Notice to Appear was issued on April 11, 2005, at the border after he had made a trip to Mexico. His request for a change of venue from San Antonio, Texas, to Atlanta, Georgia, was granted on March 8, 2006. The respondent contended in his motion to reopen that his original counsel was ineffective by not pursuing his application under 240A(a) of the Act, and that the record should be reopened and remanded. The Immigration Judge found no ineffective assistance of counsel had been proven, and that the motion should be denied.
 
The respondent has not complied substantially with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He submitted a copy of the agreement for representation, which was limited to the initial appearance, and he has informed prior counsel that he intended to make a claim of ineffective assistance to the Board. Former counsel has responded. However, the respondent did not file any complaint with the relevant authorities. He explains in his brief that the situation, in his new counsel’s opinion, does not warrant a bar complaint. If the respondent does not believe a bar complaint is warranted, he also cannot claim that the actions of his former counsel rise to the level of ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
*2 Moreover, ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding is a denial of due process only “¿iºf the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from presenting his case.” Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). See also Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent must show that the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered his hearing unfair. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998). The respondent stated in his affidavit that he was unable to pay former counsel the amount counsel wanted to continue his representation and file the application. He implies that the amount demanded was excessive, but he does not believe it merits the attention of the state bar. He also states that counsel apparently did not inform the Immigration Court of his new address, because the judge’s order was sent to his old address in North Carolina. Counsel’s motion to withdraw informs the court of the respondent’s new address in Georgia. He does not state that the use of his former address by the Immigration Court caused him any prejudice. We note that the respondent admits his former attorney advised him to attend his hearing scheduled for March 23, 2007, and to request additional time to find a new attorney. He did not appear at that time, even though he could not yet have received the Immigration Judge’s order of removal. We find that there has been no showing that the respondent was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s performance. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005). In these circumstances, we find the respondent’s due process rights have not been violated.
 
The respondent complains that the Immigration Judge did not consider him for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), but he has not made a prima facia case of eligibility. Primarily, he has not filed an affidavit indicating that he is able and willing to post bond and to leave the United States, if so ordered. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(3); 1240.26(c)(iv).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: BO WANG
File: AXXX XX3 577 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas J. Mayer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lily C. Hsu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of the People’s Republic of China. She was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on December 6, 2007, after failing to appear for a hearing. She filed a motion to reopen on February 25, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied it on April 21, 2008, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that an “exceptional circumstance” prevented her from appearing at the hearing. She indicates that the Immigration Judge misconstrued her motion as contending that she sought reopening based on a failure of notice. The record contains the respondent’s statement. Therein, she admits that she received the Notice to Appear that informed her that her hearing was scheduled for February 7, 2008. She further indicates that she hired a Mr. Dong from New Arrival Immigration Services. According to the respondent, Mr. Dong failed to inform her that the Immigration Court had changed her hearing from February 7, 2008, to December 6, 2007. The respondent further states that Mr. Dong later informed her of the order of removal that was entered in absentia, and he advised the respondent to find a medical doctor who would falsely attest that the respondent failed to attend her hearing on account of illness. The respondent further argues that Mr. Dong’s overall representation was unprofessional, and he is not authorized to practice law. She asks the Board to reopen these proceedings because she was the victim of a negligent representative.
 
An alien’s failure to appear for a hearing caused by ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute an “exceptional circumstance” warranting reopening of a proceedings. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003). The Ninth Circuit also has found ineffective assistance of counsel to exist if it is established that an alien suffered prejudice from the negligent advice of a non-attorney purporting to be a licensed attorney. See Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
In the instant case, the respondent does not indicate that Mr. Dong or any representative from New Arrival Immigration Services purported to be an attorney. The business card for New Arrival Immigration Services also does not state that the organization employs licensed attorneys to represent its clients. The respondent has therefore not established that she had detrimentally relied on the negligent advice of a person who had falsely purported to be an attorney. In addition, the respondent has not established that her failure to appear for her hearing was caused by the negligence of Mr. Dong or a representative of New Arrival Immigration Services. The respondent argues that she should have been informed of her rescheduled hearing by either Mr. Dong or New Arrival Immigration Services. However, the hearing notice was mailed to her by the Immigration Court at the address contained on the Notice to Appear. She also has not alleged in either the motion or on appeal that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing. It was therefore incumbent on her to appear even if she had not received an instruction from her representative to appear for a hearing on December 6, 2007.
 
*2 The respondent has not established that her failure to appear for her hearing was caused by the advice or lack thereof of her representative. We therefore do not find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings based on “exceptional circumstances” having prevented the respondent from appearing for her hearing.
 
We note that the respondent has not argued on appeal with particularity that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish that the hearing notice provided herein was inadequate. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) (discussing the factors for rebutting the presumption of delivery of regularly sent mail). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dominique J. Honea
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Convicted of a controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATIONS: Removability; reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 11, 2009. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Based upon a Verification of Removal (Exh. 7), the Immigration Judge made a factual finding that the respondent departed the United States on May 22, 2004, after being ordered removed (I.J. at 4), and this factual finding is not clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). Applying a de novo standard of review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has failed to meet his burden of proving his lawful re-entry to the United States. See Lopez-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir. 2008) (advising that once DHS establishes identity and alienage, the burden shifts to the respondent to prove time, place, and manner of entry).
 
Based upon evidence of the respondent’s 2003 conviction for possession or use of drug paraphernalia (Exh. 4-B), we further affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. See Matter of Martinez-Espinoza, 25 I&N Dec. 118 (BIA 2009).
 
The respondent focuses his arguments on appeal on his request for reopening based upon a claim that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance by filing a deficient motion to reopen his prior removal proceeding following the March 9, 2002, issuance of an in absentia order of removal. The Immigration Judge denied that motion on April 2, 2002, and the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of that decision on July 2, 2003.
 
*2 The respondent’s request for reopening fails. First, the respondent’s 2004 removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s 2002 in absentia order of removal acted to strip us and the Immigration Judge of authority to reopen prior removal proceedings, whether on the respondent’s motion or sua sponte. See Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008) (declining to follow Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007)). Second, the respondent has not attempted to comply with the procedure set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oma N. Nkele, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jane H. Thomson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s March 24, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind his January 3, 2006, in absentia order of removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard, and review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The record shows that the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on January 3, 2006. On March 13, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, finding that the respondent has failed to establish that he lacked proper notice of his January 3, 2006, hearing, and to meet the requirements of a motion to reopen. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to satisfy his burden of establishing any basis for granting his motion to reopen.
 
We note that the respondent first argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion because the Notice to Appear (NTA) was deficient, and because the Immigration Court in San Antonio, Texas, did not have jurisdiction to issue an in absentia order of removal in his case since he reported an address in Florida. These arguments are unavailing.
 
The record shows that the NTA was issued by a Supervisory Border Patrol Agent, who is specifically designated by the regulations as one authorized to issue an NTA. 8 C.F.R. § 239.1(a)(10); see Ali v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 544, 546-47 (5th Cir.2006). The record also shows that the NTA was filed with the San Antonio, Texas, Immigration Court. Thus, jurisdiction is vested, and venue properly lies, with the San Antonio Immigration Court. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.20(a), 1003.14(a), 1239.1(a). Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(g) does not include any language obligating the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to move for a change of venue on his behalf because he provided a Florida address upon being released on his own recognizance. This regulation simply requires the DHS to advise the Immigration Court of the respondent’s custody status, and the respondent’s fixed address at which the respondent may be served with notices or other documents pertinent to his proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(g). Moreover, the respondent was released on his own recognizance, and thus, the instructions on the Form I-830, which indicates that a motion to change venue may be filed by the DHS if the respondent is “transferred in custody to another location,” is inapplicable to him. See Respondent’s Appeal Brief, Tab 10. Accordingly, we conclude that the NTA was not deficient, and the San Antonio Immigration Court properly had jurisdiction over his case.
 
*2 An in absentia order may be rescinded if the respondent demonstrates that he or she did not receive the hearing notice in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(a)(1), (2). Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. A written notice of the hearing is not required, however, if the respondent, after being informed of his address obligation, failed to provide the address at which he or she can be contacted regarding the removal proceedings. See sections 239(a)(2)(B) of the Act.
 
The record shows that on November 24, 2004, the NTA was served in person to the respondent, and provided the respondent’s address as “210 Pelhamm Road Apt. 120, Fort Walton, FL 32547.” The NTA, under the heading “¿fºailure to appear,” notified the respondent of his obligation to provide a full mailing address at which he may be reached, and to inform the Immigration Court of any changes in his address or telephone number by using a Form EOIR-33. Not having received a Form EOIR-33, the respondent’s January 3, 2006, hearing notice was properly sent by mail to the address provided on the NTA. The record, however, indicates that this hearing notice was returned to the Immigration Court.
 
The respondent, in his affidavit in support of his motion to reopen, did not dispute that he was personally served his NTA, but instead alleges, in general terms, that he had problems communicating with the border patrol agent who gave him the NTA.¿FN3º The respondent, however, did not claim on his affidavit that he was not told or was unaware of his obligation to provide an address at which he could be reached, as he was specifically advised on the NTA, or that his hearing notice was not mailed to the address provided on the NTA. The respondent’s affidavit is spare, and does not even include any statement attesting to the full and correct address he was residing at the time the hearing notice was sent.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent did not receive “actual notice” of his January 3, 2006, hearing, as the record shows that the hearing notice was in fact returned to the Immigration Court, stamped, “rtn to sender/attempted not known.” The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2009), has held that a failure to receive actual notice of a removal hearing does not always warrant rescission of an in absentia removal order, particularly when the failure to receive actual notice was due to the aliens’ neglect of their obligation to keep the Immigration Court apprised of their current address. In the instant case, the respondent provided no evidence establishing that the address he provided, which was used on the NTA was, in fact, his true and correct mailing address where he could receive mail, and that he had not moved from that address. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, supra, at 361. On the record before the Immigration Judge, we conclude that the respondent has not met his burden of proving that his proceedings should be reopened, and his in absentia order of removal rescinded, based on lack of notice.¿FN4º
 
*3 The respondent’s assertions relating to “exceptional circumstances” are difficult to understand, and we are not persuaded that such circumstances exist that would warrant reopening his removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 17-19, 23). There was no evidence submitted showing that ineffective assistance of counsel, or other exceptional circumstances, caused his failure to appear for his January 3, 2006, hearing, and that the 180-day deadline for filing a motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order should be equitably tolled. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). There is likewise no evidence provided showing that exceptional circumstances beyond the respondent’s control prevented him from timely filing a motion to reopen to apply for new relief from removal within 90 days of the date of entry of the final administrative order of removal, nor has he submitted the requisite applications and established his prima facie eligibility for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (3); Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (setting forth requirements for filing a motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of removal proceedings); see also generally Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 356-57 (BIA 1998).
 
The respondent’s argument that he is entitled to sua sponte reopening of his proceedings because he was denied due process is unavailing. As previously discussed, the record does not demonstrate that the respondent did not receive the statutorily required notice of his January 3, 2006, hearing. There is no indication that the Immigration Judge failed to consider the evidence he submitted with his motion to reopen. Contrary to the respondent’s assertion, the Immigration Judge was not required to wait for the DHS’s response before adjudicating the motion, and the Immigration Judge’s decision to rule on the motion before receiving the DHS’s response does not establish that the Immigration Judge was biased or that he lack neutrality. The respondent, moreover, has not shown that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s actions. A lack of a response from the DHS does not compel the Immigration Judge to grant the respondent’s motion, nor is it equivalent to a “jointly filed motion” which would have allowed consideration of his otherwise untimely motion to reopen. We invoke our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings sparingly, and only for truly exceptional situations. The respondent has not demonstrated that the application of such an extraordinary remedy is warranted in this case. Matter G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*4 In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Footnotes

1

The documents in support of the respondent’s visa petition list the wrong alien registration number for the respondent.

2

The respondent has alleged on appeal that his true name is “Olvin Daniel Elvir-Sanchez.”

3

The respondent claims, in particular, that the border patrol agent told him to spell his name “Olbin,” rather than the true spelling of his name “Olvin.” At the outset, we note that the respondent’s allegation that he was compelled to misspell his own name because of a border patrol officer’s insistence that the letter “v” is pronounced like a “b” in Spanish, is undermined by the fact that the NTA listed his family name as “Elvir.” Finally, we are not persuaded that the respondent has shown that the alleged erroneous substitution of one letter in his name has any material significance to determining the propriety of the service and issuance of the NTA, the hearing notice, and to the outcome of his motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal.

4

The respondent on appeal has submitted additional evidence. However, our appellate review is limited to the evidence of record before the Immigration Judge. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). The respondent has not shown that this evidence could not have been presented previously. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Moreover, statements by counsel in a motion, Notice of Appeal, or appellate brief, are not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew L. Friedman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kori LaPoint
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated February 21, 2008. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on May 8, 2007, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5) (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the record of proceeding will be remanded for further proceedings. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600 (BIA 1978) (“¿Rºemand is effective for the stated purpose and for consideration of any and all matters which the ¿ immigration judgeº deems appropriate in the exercise of his administrative discretion or which are brought to his attention in compliance with the appropriate regulations.”). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2009); Matter of Lodge, 19 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 1987) (“Oral argument is heard at the discretion of the Board and will not be granted unless the party appealing has specified the reasons for the appeal in some meaningful fashion.”).
 
The facts as presented for the Immigration Judge’s consideration in the respondent’s motion to reopen and the Department of Homeland Security’s opposition (“DHS”) and as relevant to this appeal are as follows: The DHS personally served the respondent with the Notice to Appear on August 18, 2006, while the respondent was in DHS custody in San Diego, California (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1 (May 8, 2007)). The Notice to Appear was filed in San Diego Immigration Court on September 1, 2006 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1 (May 8, 2007)). The respondent was released from the DHS’s custody in San Diego following the posting of a $15,000 surety bond on September 27, 2006 (Exh. 3 (May 8, 2007)). At that time the respondent reported his address following release to the DHS as being in Corona, New York (Exh. 3 (May 8, 2007)).
 
The initial master calendar hearing in these proceedings was originally scheduled for October 3, 2006 (Exh. 2 (May 8, 2007)). However, on October 4, 2006, the respondent’s master calendar hearing was rescheduled for February 6, 2007 (Exh. 4 (May 8, 2007)). On January 9, 2007, the date of the respondent’s first master calendar hearing was rescheduled once again for May 8, 2007 (Exhs. 9 and 10 (May 8, 2007)). The respondent failed to appear on May 8, 2007, for the scheduled master calendar hearing and, accordingly, was ordered removed in absentia on that date (I.J. at 1). The respondent stated in the affidavit submitted in support of the motion to reopen that he received a copy of the in absentia order from the Immigration Court on May 10, 2007 (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº).
 
*2 Meanwhile, the respondent retained private counsel to file a motion to change the venue for these removal proceedings from San Diego, California to New York, New York (I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿ respondent’s affidavitº; Exhs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14 (May 8, 2007)). In all, the private counsel filed four motions for change of venue on the respondent’s behalf, each of which (1) was properly rejected by the Immigration Court staff for failure to comply with the San Diego Immigration Court’s Local Operating Procedures (Exhs. 5, 6, 7 and 8 (May 8, 2007)), (2) was denied by the Immigration Judge for failure to comply with the San Diego Immigration Court’s Local Operating Procedures (Exh. 12 (May 8, 2007)), or, in the case of the final untimely motion for change of venue filed on April 30, 2007 (Exh. 13 (May 8, 2007)), (3) had prompted the Immigration Judge to provide advanced, written notice to the respondent’s privately retained counsel (but not to the respondent personally) that “¿yºou are given to understand that it may be that the motion will not be granted,” and that the respondent “should therefore be prepared to appear in person on hearing day and be ready to proceed (I.J. at 3; Exh. 14 (May 8, 2007)).”
 
Subsequent to the entry of the May 8, 2007, in absentia removal order, the respondent received a correspondence from the DHS, Notice to Deliver Alien (Form 1-340), dated January 4, 2008, directing him to appear for removal in San Diego, California on February 5, 2008 (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1,2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº and Exh. J ¿Notice to Deliver Alien º). The DHS’s correspondence induced the respondent to retain present counsel of record who filed the underlying motion to reopen on the respondent’s behalf on February 1, 2008 (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿ respondent’s affidavitº). On February 7, 2008, the DHS filed a memorandum in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the respondent replied on February 15, 2008 (I.J. at 3).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is predicated on a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008)). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In our view, the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the actions of the respondent’s former counsel in repeatedly filing procedurally deficient motions for change of venue and, most of all, in advising the respondent without any evident justification in fact or law not to appear for the May 8, 2007, master calendar hearing constituted ineffective assistance and, therefore, “exceptional circumstances” (theoretically) warranting rescission of the in absentia removal order (I.J. at 3). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) of the Act (defining “exceptional circumstances”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996) (“¿Wºe note that one must look to the “totality of circumstances” to resolve this issue of exceptional circumstances.”); see also Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003); Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008) (“We now join our sister circuits in concluding that, under BIA precedent applicable to the pre-1996 version of the INA as well as its current iteration, a lawyer’s inaccurate advice to his client concerning an immigration hearing date can constitute ‘exceptional circumstances’ excusing the alien’s failure to appear at a deportation hearing ¿º and meriting the reopening of an in absentia deportation order ¿º.” (citing Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 801-02 (5th Cir. 2007); Lo v. Ashcroft, supra; Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54, 59 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005)); Matter of Grijalva, supra (“An order of deportation issued following a hearing conducted in absentia may be rescinded under section 242B(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(Supp. V 1993), where an alien properly establishes that his failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel which amounts to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of section 242B(f)(2) of the Act.”).
 
*3 The Immigration Judge nevertheless denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on the grounds that it was untimely and, in considering the applicability of equitable tolling to the respondent’s motion to reopen, determined that the doctrine does not apply in this case because the respondent failed to submit “conclusive proof” that the respondent retained the first private attorney subsequent to the entry of the in absentia order of removal on May 8, 2007, for the purpose of preparing and filing a motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal (I.J. at 4; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº).
 
The respondent does not dispute that the motion to reopen filed on February 1, 2008, is untimely. Thus, the sole issue is whether the doctrine of equitable tolling should be invoked in order to toll the 180-day filing deadline for motions to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia removal order based on “exceptional circumstances” arising from the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003). Although this is a close case, we conclude that it should.
 
In concluding that the doctrine of equitable tolling should not be invoked, the Immigration Judge credited a letter from the respondent’s former counsel submitted by the DHS in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen on February 7, 2008 (I.J. at 4). While the respondent claimed to have paid the former attorney a separate fee of $300.00 to file the motion to reopen shortly after he received the in absentia order in the mail, the former attorney denied this assertion in the letter dated February 6, 2008 (I.J. at 4). Specifically, the letter from the former attorney acknowledged that the respondent arrived at his law office on May 15, 2007, after, according to the respondent’s affidavit, the respondent had received the in absentia removal order on May 10, 2007, in the mail, but the respondent’s former attorney claimed that a payment of $200.00 that he had extracted from the respondent during the May 15, 2007, office visit was applied toward the remaining balance of the $1,200.00 fee that he had charged the respondent to file the (ineffective) motion(s) to change venue in the San Diego Immigration Court (I.J. at 4).
 
For his part, the respondent claims that the former attorney assured him that the entry of the in absentia order was an “error” when he visited his office after receiving the in absentia order in the mail (Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº). The respondent further claims that the former attorney failed to apprise him of the four procedurally defective motions to change venue that he had filed on the respondent’s behalf and that he only became aware of these defective motions after he retained present counsel of record and was able to obtain a copy of his file from the former attorney on January 29, 2008 (Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1,2008) at Exh. A ¿ respondent’s affidavitº). The respondent’s former attorney failed to acknowledge, much less address, these serious allegations of on-going ineffective assistance of counsel extending beyond the entry of the in absentia removal order in the letter submitted by the DHS on February 7, 2008 (I.J. at 3; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B).
 
*4 We conclude that the respondent has provided sufficient evidence in support of the motion to reopen the record of proceeding to warrant reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order dated May 8, 2007. And we disagree with the weight the Immigration Judge accorded the letter from the respondent’s former attorney dated February 6, 2008, proffered by the DHS in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, which is the only evidence in the record of proceeding invoked by the Immigration Judge in support of the conclusion that the equitable tolling doctrine does not apply under these facts (I.J. at 4). See Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
First, the assertion made by the respondent’s former attorney that he was not aware of the entry of the in absentia order dated May 8, 2007, until June 25, 2007, is highly dubious (I.J. at 3; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B). The fourth and final motion for change of venue the former attorney filed on the respondent’s behalf on April 30, 2007, reflects that he was aware of the hearing scheduled for May 8, 2007 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 13 (May 8, 2007)). Furthermore, the Immigration Judge wrote to the respondent’s former attorney on May 1, 2007, in response to that motion that “¿yºou are given to understand that it may be that the motion will not be granted,” and that the respondent “should therefore be prepared to appear in person on hearing day and be ready to proceed (I.J. at 3; Exh. 14 (May 8, 2007)).” Accordingly, we can see no reasonable explanation in the record of proceeding for the former attorney’s claimed ignorance of the entry of the in absentia removal order on May 8, 2007 (I.J. at 3; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B).
 
Second, the letter from the former attorney is silent on the most serious allegation of professional misconduct levied against him in this case, that is, that he instructed the respondent not to appear at the May 8, 2007, master calendar hearing after receiving the Immigration Judge’s May 1, 2008, correspondence directing the respondent to appear (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº); Exh. 14 (May 8, 2007)). Third, it is noteworthy that the respondent’s former attorney freely admits to accepting $200.00 from the respondent on May 15, 2007, for the provision of services that he never effectively provided after filing four procedurally defective motions for change of venue (I.J. at 4; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B).
 
We conclude that the respondent’s actions before and after the entry of the in absentia removal order exhibited a reasonable level of diligence under the circumstances; he promptly retained counsel after his release from the DHS’s custody; the action for which he retained counsel, obtaining a change of venue, was the correct initial step in fulfilling his appearance obligations in these proceedings and, after this necessary initial step failed to be carried out by the respondent’s former attorney, there is no convincing explanation that we can see on this record for the former attorney’s professed ignorance of the entry of the in absentia removal order on May 8, 2007, or the former attorney’s failure to take any step(s) to apprise and assist his client, the respondent, after the in absentia order’s entry. We therefore conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen should be granted. Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
*5 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal dated May 8, 2007, is granted. The record of proceeding is remanded for further proceedings.
 
Board Member Filppu respectfully concurs in the result. The Immigration Judge wrongly demanded “conclusive proof” that the respondent contracted with prior counsel for the filing of a motion to rescind the in absentia order. Given the totality of the evidence, the respondent met the “high standard” set by Congress for a showing of exceptional circumstances. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33, 34 (BIA 1998); section 240(c)(4)(A) and (B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents have appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 17, 2008, denying their motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondents removed in absentia for their failure to appear for the hearing on August 9, 1994. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500, 501 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal the respondents contend that the government did not demonstrate proper notice or deportability by “clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence,” as required by former section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b.
 
As the respondents’ deportation proceedings are governed by former section 242B of the Act, we apply the case of Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995) (Board held that a hearing notice which is sent by certified mail to the alien’s last known address is sufficient to establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien received written notice of the deportation hearing within the meaning of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act). The record reflects that on May 27, 1994, the Houston Immigration Court sent a separate notice of hearing by certified mail to each of the respondents at their last known address of 1550 Blalock, Apt. #161, Houston, TX 77080. Therefore, it is clear that the respondents received notice pursuant to Matter of Grijalva, supra. We held further that there “is no requirement that the certified mail return receipt be signed by the alien or a responsible person at his address to effect service.” Id. at 34. In this case, in the record of proceedings there is a signed return receipt card for each notice of hearing sent to the respondents. A notice of hearing dated May 27, 1994, was sent to respondent, Julia Ana Resendez-Gonzalez (AXXX XXX XXX), at her last known address. The receipt for certified mail is attached to the copy of the hearing notice in the record and indicates the postmark date of “05/27/94.” The corresponding return receipt card signed by “Julia A. Gonzalez” indicates the date of delivery as “5/31/94.” The record of proceedings contains the same documentation for the other two respondents. The return receipt card for the hearing notice sent to respondent Judith Ariana Gonzales-Resendez (AXXX XXX XXX) is signed by “Julia A. Gonzalez” and indicates the date of delivery as “5/31/94,” and the return receipt card for the hearing notice sent to respondent Julia Ana Gonzales-Resendez (AXXX XXX XXX) is signed by Jorge Gonzalez and indicates the date of delivery as “6/1/94.” Similarly, the article numbers on the receipts for certified mail match the article numbers on the signed return receipt cards, which are attached to the corresponding notices of hearing in the record of proceedings. The record clearly reflects that the return receipt cards specifically pertain to the notices of hearing, as they were all sent by the Office of the Immigration Judge in Houston, Texas, and they are all postmarked May 27, 1994, the same date as the hearing notices.¿FN1º
 
*2 The respondents argue that the notices of hearing were sent directly to the respondents, and that their former attorney, Juan Reyes, Esquire, was not provided with copies of the notices of hearing. However, the record does not contain a Notice of Entry or Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28), which would indicate that the respondents were represented by an attorney or representative before the Immigration Court. Therefore, the Houston Immigration Court was only required to send notices of hearing to the respondents. The lead respondent and her spouse, Jorge Gonzales, state in their affidavits that they did not understand the certified letters so they sent them to Mr. Reyes. They further indicate that in 1998, their attorney informed them that they had an order of deportation against them. We note that the respondents have not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for their failure to appear at the hearing. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In light of the documentary evidence in the record that the notices of hearing were sent by certified mail through the U.S. Postal Service to the respondents’ last known address and there is proof of delivery of the notices of hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondents received proper notice of the hearing and they have failed to overcome the strong presumption of effective service.
 
The respondents also assert that the government did not establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the respondents were deportable because they had been issued border crossing cards and were crossing the United States/Mexico border legally during 1994. They contend that the existence of the border crossing cards at the time of the allegedly illegal entry demonstrates that the government could not have met their burden of proof. However, the Orders to Show Cause reflect that the respondents were charged with entering the United States without inspection in 1986. In the in absentia orders dated August 9, 1994, the Immigration Judge found that during the hearing, “service of the Order to Show Cause upon the respondent was confirmed, and deportability on the identified charge(s) established by ‘clear, convincing, and unequivocal’ evidence which has been received to the record of proceedings.” An Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the case made by the alien or any other person during any investigation or examination. Such evidence may be admitted as long as it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair so as not to violate due process standards. Form I-213 is a record which is routinely prepared by the Department of Homeland (DHS) officers as a summary of information obtained at the time of the initial processing of an individual suspected of being an alien unlawfully present in the United States. Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308 (9th Cir. 1995). Courts have recognized the inherent trustworthiness attributable to “public records or reports” such as Form I-213. Id.; see also Matter of Gomez-Gomez, 23 I&N Dec. 522 (BIA 2002). Form I-213 is frequently offered into evidence at deportation and removal hearings, and we have noted its admissibility. Id. In his decision denying the respondents’ motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge found it unnecessary to address the respondents’ contention that they entered the United States with border crossing cards, noting that this argument was not presented to the trial court and the presiding Immigration Judge was unaware of the existence of border crossing cards.
 
*3 The respondents have submitted additional evidence on appeal. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). The record supports the finding that the respondents had notice of their hearing. Accordingly, the respondents’ appeal is dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.

All the return receipt cards for the notices of hearing have the pre-printed ‘Office of the Immigration Judge’ in Houston, Texas, as the return address. In contrast, the Orders to Show Cause were sent by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the government’s return address would appear on the return receipt cards for the Orders to Show Cause.

IN RE: JOSE ISRAEL ABDIAS ROMERO BONILLA
File: AXXX XX3 919 - Portland, OR
December 2, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaesa W. McLin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah C. Schreck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 2, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”). On July 2, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent contends in his motion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him at his hearing and on appeal to the Board. He states that his attorney did not properly prepare him for the hearing and did not ask questions that would have established his presence in the United States as of February 13, 2001, which was required for the respondent to be granted TPS.
 
With certain exceptions, motions to reopen must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Under the controlling law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a respondent seeking to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the procedural requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent must also show that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence and must demonstrate that actual prejudice was suffered due to the attorney’s performance. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 794-95 (9th Cir. 2005). Equitable tolling is available to a respondent who is prevented from filing the motion within the required time period due to deception, fraud, or error if the respondent exercises due diligence in discovering such circumstances. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
First, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. Because the final order of removal in this case was issued on April 2, 2009, the motion to reopen was required to be filed no later than July 1, 2009. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act. The motion, which was filed on July 2, 2009, was 1 day late. Additionally, the respondent does not allege that equitable tolling should apply and does not claim that there was any deception, fraud, or error that prevented him from filing the motion in a timely fashion.
 
Furthermore, even assuming that the motion were timely filed and assuming that the respondent substantially complied with the technical requirements set out in Lozada, the respondent has failed to show how he was prejudiced by his attorney’s performance. As the DHS correctly argues, the respondent was denied TPS because he provided inconsistent testimony and documentary evidence as to his date and manner of entry. While he claimed in his TPS application to have entered in January 2001, he conceded that his mother’s application for TPS indicated his entry was not until April 2001 or later (Tr. at 26). Also, he claimed at different times to have entered the United States in Phoenix, Arizona and Houston, Texas, neither of which is near the border. The affidavits of family and friends, which were written many years after the respondent’s claimed date of entry, were determined to be insufficient to establish his presence in the United States as of the required date, given the other evidence.
 
*2 The respondent has failed to explain in his motion what additional evidence was available at the time of the hearing that could have established his eligibility for TPS. In fact, the respondent has still not established his eligibility for TPS. Accordingly, the respondent has not shown any prejudice from his former attorney’s representation.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has filed a timely motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) to reconsider our March 27, 2009, final decision dismissing the appeal taken from the Immigration Judge’s decision. The Immigration Judge denied a continuance to pursue adjustment of status based upon the second petition (Form I-130) filed by the respondent’s United States citizen wife, and ordered the respondent removed. In our final decision, we agreed, inter alia, that the Immigration Judge did not err in concluding the respondent failed to establish eligibility for adjustment of status in light of the revocation of an earlier petition because of marriage fraud pursuant to section 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§ 1154(c). We also denied a motion to reopen filed while the appeal was pending. That motion requested a remand to apply for cancellation of removal. As the instant motion proffers purportedly new evidence, it will also be treated as a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The instant motion argues that, during proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent was the victim of the ineffective assistance of counsel who failed to advise the respondent that he was eligible to apply for cancellation of removal. In support, the motion proffers a complaint against Attorney Mark McBroom, the counsel who represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge.
 
However, the complaint against the attorney is on a Form EOIR-44 and should have been filed with the Office of General Counsel, Executive Office of Immigration Review, rather than with this Board. The complaint does not include specific allegations of ineffective assistance. Also, no complaint has been filed with the appropriate state bar authority and no letter has been sent to the Attorney providing an opportunity to respondent to the allegations.
 
The motion does not comply with the procedural requirements to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that would warrant a tolling of the time limit on motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). Furthermore, the motion is number barred. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
*2 Also, there is no explanation as to why the ineffective assistance of prior counsel argument was not made while the appeal was pending, when the respondent was represented by a different attorney. The motion does not cite to any errors of law or fact in our prior decision that would warrant reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Prince Uche Nwakanma, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen after our September 29, 2009, decision dismissing his appeal. He wishes to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and urges that his prior attorney was ineffective for failing to file such an application at his hearing below. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
The respondent has failed to support his motion to reopen with an application for the relief he seeks, or to otherwise demonstrate that he is prima facie eligible for a section 212(h) waiver. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (motions to reopen must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief “and all supporting documentation”); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988). Moreover, the record reflects that the respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1994 and that he was thereafter convicted of an aggravated felony, for which he was found removable. As such, he is barred from receiving a 212(h) waiver. Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610 (BIA 1996). Thus, it would not appear that any failure to submit a waiver application below could be considered ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL and MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William E. Graves, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gwendylan Tregerman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand, termination
 
The respondent filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s August 26, 2009, finding the respondent removable, as charged, based on his record of conviction (Exh. 2), and denied the respondent’s request to terminate proceedings. While the respondent’s appeal was pending before the Board, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and remand this matter to the Immigration Court for further proceedings based on new, material, and previously unavailable evidence. The respondent’s request is premised on the claim that the conviction which forms the basis for the grounds of removal, has been vacated. Specifically, the respondent has presented evidence that on October 5, 2009, the First Justice of the Brockton District Court, Brockton, Massachusetts, granted the respondent’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Order a New Trial¿FN1º on the basis of ineffective assistance of former counsel at his criminal trial. We observe the respondent’s motion was properly served on the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and whereas the DHS has expressed no opposition to remanding the record for further proceedings, it has also indicated that on remand it proposes to lodge additional charges against the respondent.
 
The Board in Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), reversed on other grounds, Pickering v. Gonzales, 465 F.3d 263 (6th Cir.2006), held that if a court vacates a conviction based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings, there is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. However, an alien remains convicted of a removable offense when the predicate conviction is vacated simply for rehabilitative purposes or to aid the alien in avoiding adverse immigration consequences and not because of any procedural or substantive defect in the original conviction. Id. at 624; see also Saleh v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 17, 25 (2d Cir. 2007) (joining and citing to the decisions of the various circuits in support of the Board’s decision in Pickering that if a court vacates an alien’s criminal conviction solely on the basis of immigration hardships or rehabilitation, rather than on the basis of a substantive or procedural defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the conviction is not eliminated for immigration purposes and will continue to serve as a valid factual predicate for a charge of removability despite its vacatur); see also Matter of Chavez-Martinez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007) (alien’s conviction cannot be vacated solely for immigration purposes).
 
*2 In the matter before us, however, it is clear the criminal court judge’s ruling granting the respondent’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Order a New Trial, was based on his finding that the plea entered by the respondent at his criminal trial was not “knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made,” where it was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the court’s action was premised upon what it perceived to be a constitutional infirmity in the underlying proceedings, rather than some form of post-conviction relief. See Rumierz v. Gonzales, 456 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2006) (a vacated conviction is no longer a “conviction” within the meaning of the immigration laws only “if a court with jurisdiction vacates ¿the º conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.”); Herrera-Inirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299 (1st Cir. 2000).
 
The question here is whether there is now an conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude, or any conviction, rendering the respondent not only removable but also precluding his eligibility for relief, or whether the proceedings should be terminated. Consequently, in view of the foregoing and the lack of opposition by the DHS, the respondent’s motion will be granted, the record will be remanded to Immigration Court for further proceedings, in order to enable the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence offered by the respondent relating to his removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), as well as considering any new additional charges that may be lodged by DHS,¿FN2º and to determine whether the respondent can now establish his eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the proceedings should be terminated.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reconsider, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
On August 5, 2003, an Immigration Judge issued a final removal order against the respondent, who is from Jamaica. The Immigration Judge granted voluntary departure, found that no other relief from removal was requested, and noted that appeal to the Board was waived. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied on February 26, 2009.
 
The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on September 2, 2009. The Board found no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely and numerically barred, as it was not submitted within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2003, decision and was the respondent’s second motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The Board also noted that it does not have the authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or other general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1).
 
The Board also found that, to the extent that the respondent argued that her failure to depart the United States under her voluntary departure order was a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, we agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen failed to comply with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board recognized that the respondent had submitted additional evidence on appeal regarding her claim of ineffective assistance; however, the Board found, we do not consider evidence first offered on appeal, and the respondent failed to establish that the information contained in the documents she sought to offer on appeal could not have been produced before the Immigration Judge.
 
The Board declined to reconsider its September 2, 2009, decision on September 22, 2009. The Board found no error in its refusal to grant the respondent a second extension to file a brief on appeal. The Board also treated the respondent’s filing as an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen, as the respondent submitted evidence with her motion. Moreover, the Board found, the respondent did not present an exceptional situation which would warrant sua sponte reopening.
 
The respondent on October 8, 2009, filed a “Motion To Re-Consider Sua Sponte”. To the extent that the respondent seeks reconsideration of the Board’s September 22, 2009, decision, the regulations state that a party “may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). To the extent that the respondent presents a motion to reopen, the motion is untimely, and numerically barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). As the Board stated in its most recent decision, we could only reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a). This action is taken only in “exceptional situations”, Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), which have not been presented here. The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The pending motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 8, 2008. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to suppress but denied her motion to terminate. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to terminate. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent and her sisters were stopped by a deputy sheriff for traffic violations. They claim that the traffic stop was racially-motivated. An immigration officer was called to the scene and the respondent and her sisters were apprehended. During these events, the respondent, her sisters, and their mother, who arrived after her daughters’ apprehension, made admissions of alienage. The respondent, her three sisters, and their mother were all placed in proceedings.
 
At a master calendar hearing held on August 28, 2006, the respondent appeared with counsel, pled to the Notice to Appear, and conceded removability. Subsequently, pursuant to a motion filed by the respondent, her case was consolidated with proceedings for her mother and sisters.¿FN1º The respondent’s new counsel filed a motion to suppress. However, the new counsel did not request that the respondent’s concession be withdrawn or raise any issues in that regard before the Immigration Judge. New counsel did not explain why the concession should not be binding on the respondent, except for claiming that the concession was made in bond proceedings and was tainted evidence.
 
The Immigration Judge granted the motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the traffic stop.¿FN2º However, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate based on her independent admissions of alienage, through counsel, at a master calendar hearing in removal proceedings.
 
We review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
On appeal, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge erred by failing to suppress the concession of removability made by her prior counsel at an August 28, 2006, hearing (Tr. at 3).¿FN3º The respondent contends that the concession cannot be considered because it was tainted evidence and was made during a bond hearing. We disagree. The respondent conceded removability before her new counsel filed the motion to suppress the Form I-213. Furthermore, the concession was obtained during a master calendar hearing in removal proceedings, not a bond proceeding as argued by the respondent on appeal. See Tr. at 1 (stating that the respondent was in removal proceedings); Tr. at 5 (the respondent’s prior attorney requesting that the master calendar hearing be continued); Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings dated August 16, 2006 (indicating that a master calendar hearing in removal proceedings was scheduled for August 28, 2006). Independently obtained evidence such as statements made by the respondent at a hearing may be relied upon in removal proceedings. Matter of Cervantes-Tortes, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 Lastly, to the extent that the respondent claims that she would not have been placed in proceedings but for the unlawful seizure, she has no legitimate expectation of avoiding deportation proceedings and remaining in illegal status indefinitely. See, e.g., Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973-74 (9th Cir. 2004). Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable as charged. Therefore, we affirm his denial of the respondent’s motion to terminate.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oscar L. Amorow, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kellie Santos-DeJesus
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 29, 2009, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2007, decision. The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider on May 28, 2009. The respondent has submitted documentation with her motion, and, cast as a motion to reopen, her motion is timely. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The Board considered the respondent’s prior motion to remand pursuant to Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compean has now been vacated. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). With respect to reconsideration, the motion is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent has not identified a material error of fact or law as of the time that our decision was rendered. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Although Matter of Compean has been vacated, we find that under the pre-Compean standards, the respondent still has not demonstrated prejudice with respect to the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of her request for a waiver under section 212(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(I), or our agreement thereof (I.J. at 5; Bd. Dec. at 2). Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not carried the “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if her motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The respondent has submitted, inter alia, evidence that she has filed a Form I-601, Form I-485, and has an approved Form I-130. She has also submitted evidence that she has communicated with her prior attorney regarding her current ineffective assistance of counsel claim. However, as we found above, the respondent has failed to establish prejudice arising from her former attorney’s actions (Bd. Dec. at 2). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has provided no evidence to disturb the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s departure from the United States would not result in extreme hardship to her husband, for purposes of a section 212(i) waiver of inadmissibility (I.J. at 5; Bd. Dec. at 2). We arrived at this conclusion in our prior decision, and the respondent has provided no evidence of hardship with her current motion.
 
*2 Accordingly, we do not find a remand warranted based on the respondent’s arguments. Id; see also Afwani v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 788 (4th Cir. 2008). Therefore, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sharon B. Gray, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 19, 2008, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on May 23, 2008. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Specifically, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not demonstrate that the in absentia order of removal qualifies for rescission under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (stating that the Board reviews questions of law de novo); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (recognizing that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (stating that whenever an alien is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to attorney of record). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (mandating that the Board “will accept the determination of factual issues by an immigration judge … unless the determination is clearly erroneous”).
 
It is undisputed that notice of the respondent’s May 23, 2008, hearing that was scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. was properly served on the respondent’s former counsel of record (Exh. 3). However, the respondent on appeal claims she that appeared at 1:30 p.m., instead of 9:00 a.m., due to the erroneous advice of her former attorney (Resp. Br. at 5-6).
 
Although the respondent contends that she did, in fact, appear, albeit at 1:30 p.m., instead of 9:00 a.m., the respondent on appeal provides no details of the circumstances surrounding her late arrival, i.e., whether she spoke with Immigration Court personnel, whether the Immigration Judge was still on the bench, or what, if any efforts were made to contact the Immigration Judge. Cf. Matter of Alarcon-Chavez v. Gonzales, 403 F.3d 343 (5th Cir. 2005) (holding that an alien who arrives only 20 minutes late for his Immigration Court hearing, endeavors unsuccessfully to have the Immigration Judge conduct the hearing, and promptly files a motion to reopen has not failed to appear). Therefore, on this record, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that her late appearance should be excused.
 
*2 Second, we reject the respondent’s apparent ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent provided no evidence other than her own affidavit to support her claim that she received erroneous advice from her former counsel. Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent failed to show she did not receive notice of her hearing, which was properly served on the respondent’s former attorney of record. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving, denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”). We also do not find that the respondent’s assertion that her former attorney failed to properly inform her of her scheduled hearing is alone sufficient to demonstrate patent error. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nor, as the Immigration Judge noted, has the respondent either explicitly alleged ineffective assistance of counsel or sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
On this record, and in view of the 2008 final removal order, we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, for the reasons explained by the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Lopez-Wilson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Paul R. Stultz
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of April 9, 2008, in which his motion to remand was denied. The record will be remanded.
 
On January 4, 2008, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal to El Salvador, of which he is a native and citizen, but granted a period of voluntary departure until May 5, 2008. On February 21, 2008, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen, claiming that his former counsel never advised him of the opportunity to apply for asylum and withholding of removal.
 
In his decision denying the motion, the Immigration Judge cited the time and numerical restrictions on motions to reopen set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and he concluded that the respondent did not fall within the exception to those limitations contained in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).
 
The initial period of voluntary departure was granted pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b), and among the prerequisites for such a grant is that the respondent waive appeal of all issues. The respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision but instead filed the motion with the Immigration Judge. However, the motion was technically barred neither on numerical or timeliness grounds. The motion, filed well within the 90-day period permitted for motions to reopen, was based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and the Immigration Judge did not address it merits.
 
Consequently, we will remand this case for the Immigration Judge to revisit the motion to address its merits and enter a new decision. The following order will consequently be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Julia M. Toro, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dimple R. Shah
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 13, 2008, decision denying his request for a postponement to obtain a witness subpoena and denying his request for voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent first contends that the Immigration Judge erred in finding him statutorily ineligible for “pre-conclusion” voluntary departure under section 240B(a)(1) of the Act because the statute does not specifically require travel documentation.¿FN1º See Respondent’s Notice of Appeal. However, as noted by the Immigration Judge, in order to obtain “pre-conclusion” voluntary departure, an alien must be willing to waive appeal of all issues (I.J. at 8). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i) (2009). Here, the respondent indicated that he was appealing the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a postponement to seek a witness subpoena (I.J. at 8). As a result, the respondent was not eligible for “pre-conclusion” voluntary departure (I.J. at 8-9). Therefore, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision in this regard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d) (de novo review).
 
Next, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not allowing a postponement to obtain a subpoena for the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) officer that conducted his and his wife’s interview in regard to his application for adjustment of status. See Respondent’s Notice of Appeal. The respondent asserts that the DHS officer that conducted the interview forced his wife to sign a document attesting to the alleged marriage fraud under duress. See id. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request due to his failure to follow Local Operating Procedures Rules 2 and 5 in regard to the filing of both a written motion and a witness list prior to the hearing (I.J. at 2-3). The Immigration Judge also concluded that the respondent failed to establish good cause for an adjournment to obtain a subpoena where he and his counsel were aware of the relevant DHS documentation as early as May 2007 and failed to seek the subpoena prior to the date of the hearing (I.J. at 2-3).
 
*2 Rule 5 of the Local Operating Procedures of the Baltimore Immigration Court, promulgated pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.40, provided as follows:¿FN2º
Except in cases of unforeseen rebuttal witnesses, if any party intends to present one or more witnesses, other than the respondent(s), the party intending to call such witness must file a witness list not less than ten (10) days before the merit hearing, identifying
 
(1) the subject matter of the testimony of each proposed witness, and
 
(2) the language of such witness and whether an interpreter will be needed.
 
The respondent did not file a witness list. Absent exceptional circumstances, an Immigration Judge acts within the scope of her discretion by excluding the testimony of witnesses who were not included in a pre-hearing witness list. See Positive Black Talk, Inc. v. Cash Money Records, Inc., 394 F.3d 357, 378 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Singer v. City of Waco, 324 F.3d 813, 822 (5th Cir. 2003)). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s contention that he was calling the DHS officer as a rebuttal witness was insufficient inasmuch as he was aware of the witness and the disputed documentation as early as May 2007 (I.J. at 2-3).
 
The respondent has not established, or even argued, that the omission of a witness list was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore the decision not to file the list is binding on the respondent. See generally Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, decisions of counsel are binding on alien clients). Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that the failure of the DHS officer to testify caused him substantial prejudice, as required to prove a due process violation. Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981). Specifically, the relevance of the testimony of the DHS officer to the respondent’s proceedings is unclear as it did not affect either his removability or his application for voluntary departure.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Robert Lieber, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert K. Bingham
Special Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative order in this case was entered on August 19, 2002. On September 26, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied because it was filed six years after the final administrative order. It is therefore untimely. With certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent has failed to establish a basis to equitably toll the 90-day deadline. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-135 (2d Cir. 2000)(aliens relying on equitable tolling must establish that their constitutional right to due process was violated by counsel’s conduct and that they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled). See also Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-32 (2d Cir. 2008) (an alien is required to exercise due diligence both before and after he has or should have discovered ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
We first point out that the record does not show that either Sheri Paige or Mario DeMarco, the counsel against whom he substantively makes his allegations of ineffective assistance, represented him in these proceedings. It was Mark C. Salvucci, who was associated with Mr. DeDarco’s law offices, who appeared on the respondent’s behalf in the proceedings before the Immigration Judge and before the Board on appeal. Mr. DeMarco did not file a notice that he was representing the respondent nor did he appear at the hearing or submit any filings on his behalf.¿FN1º Further, although Mr. Salvucci is mentioned in passing in the letter to bar counsel (Exh. C), disciplinary complaint forms and specific allegations of ineffectiveness are argued in the motion only with respect to Ms. Paige and Mr. DeMarco (Exh. D). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The respondent has not demonstrated that he acted diligently in pursuing a claim of ineffective assistance against a counsel who represented him in these proceedings. See Iavorski v. United States INS, supra; Rashid v. Mukasey, supra.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; stay of removal
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 13, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s June 1, 2009, decision finding the respondent removable as charged and denying him various forms of relief from removal. On October 21, 2009, the respondent filed the instant timely motion for reconsideration of our October 13, 2009, decision and for a stay of removal pending our disposition of the motion. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent has failed to identify any material error of fact or law that would justify reversal of our prior decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s assertions that reconsideration is warranted are lacking in merit. First, the fact that the DHS did not charge the respondent with removability as an aggravated felon based on his 2005 larceny conviction has no bearing on whether that conviction constitutes an aggravated felony that renders the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3). And we find no factual or legal error in our determination that the respondent’s larceny conviction is an aggravated felony that pretermits his application for cancellation of removal. Hence, we see no basis to reconsider our affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s denial of cancellation of removal.
 
The respondent also contends that the Immigration Judge failed to engage in fact-finding to determine whether his 2000 conviction for possession of narcotics renders him ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). (Motion to Reconsider at 2-3, 6). However, that argument could and should have been raised on direct appeal and, as such, does not warrant reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that a motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied). In any event, as we pointed out in our October 13, 2009, decision, the respondent did not even seek section 212(h) relief at his original hearing, notwithstanding his contention to the contrary (Motion to Reconsider at 7). To the extent that the respondent now claims for the first time that his former counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue a section 212(h) waiver, that allegation does not implicate an error of fact or law in our prior decision that would warrant reconsideration.¿FN1º
 
*2 We also deny reconsideration based on the respondent’s vague, newly raised claim that his 2000 narcotics conviction is not a controlled substance offense for immigration purposes and, as such, should not affect his eligibility for section 212(h) relief (Motion to Reconsider at 6). That argument could and should have been raised on direct appeal and, thus, provides no basis for reconsideration of our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58.
 
We also see no basis to reconsider our prior decision pursuant to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Romero v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 930 (9th Cir. 2007). That case is non-binding in the Second Circuit, in which this case arises. In any event, the respondent has not clearly articulated why that case would warrant reconsideration of our prior decision (Motion to Reconsider at 4), and we see no reason why it would. To the extent that the respondent is now, for the first time, seeking to challenge the DHS’s decision to charge him under section 212 of the Act rather than section 237 of the Act in his removal proceedings, that argument could and should have been raised earlier in the proceedings and, as such, does not justify reconsideration of our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58.
 
Finally, while we acknowledge that we never expressly addressed the respondent’s request for review of his appeal by three Board members in our October 13, 2009, decision, any error in that regard is harmless and does not warrant reconsideration of our prior decision. This case does not fall within any of the regulatory categories warranting review by a three-member panel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (e)(6). Our October 13, 2009, adjudication of this matter by a single Board Member was, therefore, appropriate.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We further note that, to the extent that the respondent is seeking reopening of his proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel, he has failed to offer any evidence that substantially complies with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988), or demonstrate that he suffered the requisite prejudice from counsel’s alleged inaction, such that reopening of these proceedings would be warranted. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009); see also Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2007) (providing that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show substantial compliance with Lozada’s requirements and that he was prejudiced by the performance of counsel).

IN RE: GHASSAN BADIH MANSOUR, BENEFICIARY OF VISA PETITION FILED BY GLORIA JEAN ANDERSON, PETITIONER
File: AXXX XX0 004 - San Bernardino, CA
October 30, 2009
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Neda Zaman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lucinda A. Love
Associate Regional Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
*1 The petitioner, a United States citizen, appeals from the decision of the Field Office Director (“Director”) dated April 2, 2009, denying the visa petition which was filed on behalf of her husband, the beneficiary. The record will be remanded.
 
The Director found that the evidence submitted by the petitioner was insufficient to establish by “clear and convincing evidence” that the petitioner has a bona fide marriage with the beneficiary.¿FN1º This standard of proof is applicable because the beneficiary married after the commencement of removal proceedings against him on December 18, 2002.¿FN2º Consequently, the requirements of sections 204(g) and 245(e)(3) and 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii) apply.
 
In addition to evidence of the legal termination of their prior marriages, the record contains evidence of a joint life for the petitioner and the beneficiary, such as their monthly rental agreement for “316 W.40th Street, San Bernardino, CA 92407;” the petitioner’s voter’s registration card, showing a joint residence; a joint Bank of America check; evidence of joint insurance through Farmer’s Insurance; and a notice of delinquent motor vehicle renewal sent to their “316 W.40th Street” residence. Despite this evidence which was submitted in response to the July 30, 2008 and September 5, 2008, requests for further evidence, the Notice of Intent to Deny (“NOID”) only mentioned the lease agreement and the proof of car insurance. The Director’s final decision likewise only referenced the Bank of America joint account and the joint automobile registration. Neither the NOID nor the final decision in this case mentioned the same evidence or all of the record evidence in arriving at the conclusion that there was not “clear and convincing” proof of the marital bona fides.
 
In order to ensure a correct outcome to the instant visa petition, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Director to verify the completeness of the record and reevaluate her legal and factual findings by taking into account all of the record evidence. On remand, both parties may submit additional evidence, including that evidence which has been submitted for the first time on appeal. See Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Obaigbena, 19 I&N Dec. 533 (BIA 1988) (this Board will not generally accept or consider evidence offered for the first time on appeal).
 
*2 In light of our remand, we decline to address the petitioner’s claim that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from her prior attorney of record, Mr. Gregory Olive. We will note, however, that her only evidence in support of a due process claim consists of a letter from the California State Bar Association which states that they have no record of attorney Olive on their membership list. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir. 2000) (Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial). See also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).¿FN3º
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Field Office Director for further consideration of the visa petition consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The denial is based solely on a failure to meet the burden of proof, not on a finding that the marriage is a “sham” marriage. See Matter of Tawfik, 20 I&N Dec. 166 (BIA 1990) (evidence of a fraudulent marriage “must be substantial and probative”).

2

According to the record, the beneficiary has been married three times since his arrival in the United States. His first marriage to “Amal Al-Khoury Tourma” ended on February 26, 2002. His second marriage to “Kellijo C. Norton” ended on April 18, 2007. He married the petitioner on February 12, 2008. It appears that this is the first visa petition filed on behalf of the beneficiary.

On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision setting forth standards for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, but this decision was recently vacated by the current Attorney General.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose W. Vega, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret R. Kugel
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on September 15, 2008 in a final administrative order. Over a year later, on September 24, 2009, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen. See C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that former counsel failed to notify him of the Board’s September 15, 2008, decision, and requests that the Board reopen, or reissue, its earlier decision so that he can preserve his right to appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. However, the respondent has produced no evidence in support of his argument, and the respondent has provided nothing to indicate that he acted with due diligence in claiming that equitable tolling applies to his reopening deadline. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252-53 (3d Cir. 2005). Moreover, the respondent has not met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); we note, specifically, that he has not, inter alia, demonstrated how he has been prejudiced by any alleged untimely Circuit Court appeal. Id. Incidentally, the Board’s September 15, 2008, decision was mailed to the respondent’s attorney’s address of record as provided on his EOIR-27, and the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional circumstance which would persuade us to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The pending motion will be, therefore, denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX3 142 - San Diego, CA
October 30, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eudene Eunique-Valle, Esquire
*1 On August 20, 2009, the respondent, who is from Mexico, submitted a timely “Motion for Reconsideration”, concerning the Board’s July 21, 2009, decision. Section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, as an alien who, at any time, knowingly encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted or aided any other alien to enter or try to enter the United States in violation of law. The Immigration Judge also denied an application for special rule cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2)(A) of the Act. The respondent was represented before the Immigration Judge by Robin Chandler Carr.
 
Current counsel filed a Notice of Appeal with the Board on April 18, 2008, stating only that “¿tºhe Immigration Judge erred in finding respondent deportable because she was merely a passenger in the vehicle and she did not do any affirmative act in furtherance of alien smuggling.” Counsel was given the opportunity to file a brief to the Board, but no brief was filed. The Board properly noted when it dismissed her appeal on July 21, 2009, that the respondent challenged only the Immigration Judge’s finding that she is removable under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act. In finding that the respondent’s removability as an alien smuggler had been established by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence, the Board stated that:
Specifically contradicting the respondent’s contention in the Notice of Appeal that she took no affirmative action in furtherance of the smuggling of two minors from Mexico is the Record of Sworn Statement of the respondent taken at San Ysidro Port of Entry by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement Border Inspector (Exh. 11). The respondent stated that she contacted her daughter in Mexico, and made arrangements to have her granddaughter flown to Tijuana, where the respondent met her at the airport. The respondent stated that she had contacted her sister-in-law to help her smuggle her granddaughter into the United States, and that her sister-in-law agreed to help by providing her own United States citizen daughter’s birth certificate to use at the border. The respondent further indicated that she knew it was illegal to bring individuals into the United States without valid documents. By her own admissions, the respondent was more than just a passenger in the vehicle stopped at the port of entry, but rather was an active participant in arranging, and carrying out the plan to have her granddaughter illegally enter the United States.
 
 
*2 The respondent’s motion claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from Robin Chandler Carr, who represented her before the Immigration Judge. The respondent asserts that Carr did not assist her to file evidence in support of a claim to special rule cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2)(A) of the Act (Respondent’s Mot., at 2-3; Respondent’s Affidavit). The motion claims that the attorney did not submit documentary evidence that the respondent had been subject to battery or extreme cruelty by her lawful permanent resident husband, Id; section 240A(b)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act. The respondent argues in a “Motion To Stay Deportation” that Carr erred by not objecting to the introduction of the sworn statement (removal hearing Exh. 11).
 
As noted, however, on appeal to the Board, while represented by current counsel, the respondent did not challenge the Immigration Judge’s denial of special rule cancellation of removal, and made no claim that she had received ineffective assistance of counsel from prior counsel. 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(1)(a motion to reopen will not be granted unless “the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing”); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006) (indicating that “¿aº motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied”). Moreover, the pending motion is unaccompanied by any evidence that would support a claim to special rule cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2)(A) of the Act. Therefore, there is no reason to reconsider or reopen the respondent’s case concerning such relief.
 
The motion also seeks to have the Board reconsider its decision agreeing with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act (Respondent’s Mot., at 3-4). The Board will not reconsider its July 21, 2009, decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra (a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error, assert that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, or argue a change in law). The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge found that she had been subject to battery by her husband, and the Immigration Judge and Board should have determined that she therefore was under duress when she acted as an alien smuggler (Respondent’s Mot., at 3-4). Contrary to this argument, in determining that the respondent was ineligible for special rule cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2)(A) of the Act, the Immigration Judge did not conclude that the respondent had been subject to battery by her husband, but “… there is significantly conflicting testimony as to whether or not respondent was abused or subject to extreme cruelty by her spouse” (I.J. at 15). In finding that the respondent’s removability as an alien smuggler had been established by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence, the Board fully considered the argument that the respondent took no affirmative act in furtherance of alien smuggling, and properly rejected this argument based on the evidence presented in the case. The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s “Motion for Reconsideration” is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s grant of a stay on October 21, 2009, pending consideration of the motion, is vacated in light of the Board’s order denying the “Motion for Reconsideration”.

IN RE: NOORIA GARDIZY
File: AXXX XX2 322 - San Francisco, CA
October 29, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank P. Sprouls, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Afghanistan. She has resided in the United States since the 1980s and was a lawful permanent resident for many years. On March 17, 2004, the Immigration Judge pretermitted the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal and ordered her removed based on two theft convictions. On January 24, 2005, the Board issued its final administrative decision in this proceeding.
 
On December 2, 2005, the Board denied a motion to reopen, which was based on ineffective assistance of counsel, as well as changed country conditions. On May 20, 2009, the Ninth Circuit denied in part and granted in part the petition for review with respect to the motion, and remanded the record for further proceedings related to the respondent’s arguments involving changed country conditions. Gardizy v. Holder, No. 05-76969, 2009 WL 1396834 (9th Cir. May 20, 2009).¿FN1º
 
On August 27, 2009, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The respondent argues, inter alia, that she still has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her gender. In support of her motion, she has attached additional background information on the treatment of women in Afghanistan.
 
The most recent motion, as well as the motion we must reconsider on remand, are clearly untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, the time and number limitations do not apply to a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)(time and number limits do not apply to motions to reopen “¿tºo apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality … if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing”).
 
The motion will be granted. The respondent has not demonstrated changed country conditions or circumstances since the time of her 2004 hearing before the Immigration Judge with respect to the treatment of women in Afghanistan. However, after residing in the United States for so many years, a large part of the time as a lawful permanent resident, it appears that the respondent has adopted Western styles and attitudes. Further, according to her cancellation of removal application, she was divorced in the United States, and has several United States citizen children. Such changes may result in much worse circumstances for the respondent if she returns to Afghanistan. Further, she may have a claim of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of the fact that she is a woman who has adopted Western customs (a political statement). Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted and the record remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision, including any available relief.

IN RE: ROBERT HERBERT TELLERIA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Stoller, Esquire¿FN1º
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Manuel Ramirez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(C), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)º - Controlled substance trafficker
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) Waiver
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s May 19, 2008, reissued decision denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994). The appeal will be sustained in part and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Bolivia and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, does not dispute that he is removable as charged. Accordingly, the only issue on appeal is whether the respondent merits section 212(c) relief in discretion. We review such discretionary judgments de novo, but the findings of fact underlying such judgments are reviewed for clear error. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(ii) (2008).
 
In a decision issued on August 20, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for section 212(c) relief in the exercise of discretion and ordered him removed to Bolivia. The respondent appealed that decision to this Board, but the appeal was dismissed as untimely in November 2007. The respondent then filed a motion with the Immigration Judge requesting, among other things, that the judge reissue his earlier decision in order to preserve the respondent’s appeal rights, which had been compromised by his attorney’s neglect. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had received ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore he granted the respondent’s motion for the limited purpose of reissuing his August 20, 2007, decision.¿FN2º The respondent now appeals from that reissued decision.
 
In determining whether the respondent merits a favorable exercise of discretion, we must balance the adverse factors evidencing his undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of section 212(c) relief appears in the best interests of this country. Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581, 584 (BIA 1978). As the Immigration Judge determined, significant negative factors militate against a favorable exercise of discretion in this case. The respondent is removable because he sustained a 1990 federal felony conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a) and 846. Furthermore, the respondent has sustained three separate convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol (“DUI”). Two of those convictions occurred in quick succession in 1995. The third such conviction occurred in 2006, shortly after these removal proceedings commenced, but was based on an offense committed in 2005.
 
*2 As the Immigration Judge determined, the respondent has also adduced very substantial equities in support of his claim. The respondent has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since infancy, a period of approximately 40 years. Further, he has been married to a United States citizen for nearly 20 years and has 3 minor children, all of whom are United States citizens. The respondent’s United States citizen parents also reside in his home. In short, the respondent’s whole life is in this country, and his family will experience significant emotional and economic hardship if he is removed. The respondent has been gainfully employed in the computer industry in recent years, and he and his wife own 2 vehicles and are mortgagors on a 5-bedroom house, but the respondent’s wife-who is employed as a registered nurse-would not have sufficient income to afford this property in the absence of the respondent’s financial contributions. These equities are “unusual and outstanding” within the meaning of our precedents.
 
We consider this to be a very close case. The respondent’s equities are very strong, and we cannot lightly disregard the hardship his family will experience in the event of removal. Although the respondent’s drug crime is a serious adverse factor, he claims to have been a minor player in the drug conspiracy and to have been motivated to commit the offense out of economic desperation. (Tr. 16-17). Furthermore, the respondent claims that he was not driving drunk when he was arrested for DUI in 2005, and that he was only convicted of that crime because the arresting officers in Texas “were not very reasonable” and failed to administer a Breathalyzer or urine test and because his criminal defense attorney encouraged him to plead guilty despite his innocence. (Tr. 70-73).
 
The Immigration Judge was not obliged to accept the respondent’s mitigating account of his conduct. The problem we face on appeal, however, is that the Immigration Judge’s credibility assessment is internally contradictory. In his decision of August 20, 2007, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was “entitled to a positive finding of credibility.” (I.J. Dec. at 17). Yet after making that positive credibility finding, the Immigration Judge proceeded to express serious (and understandable) misgivings about the plausibility of many of the respondent’s claims. (I.J. Dec. at 17-18). Furthermore, in denying relief, the Immigration Judge appeared largely to discredit the respondent’s account of his activities in connection with the drug conspiracy and the 2005 DUI offense. (I.J. Dec. at 17-18, 20-21). We cannot reconcile this inconsistency. The respondent’s account is either credible or implausible; it cannot be both.
 
If the respondent is entitled to a positive credibility finding with respect to his accounts of the 1990 drug crime and 2005 DUI offense, then he may well have demonstrated to our satisfaction that he merits relief. However, if those accounts are not credible, then his continued presence in this country would likely not be in the best interests of the United States. We cannot make such credibility determinations on appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv). Accordingly, we will remand this matter to the Immigration Judge for entry of a new decision with respect to the respondent’s credibility. Until such a determination is made, we have no basis for appellate review. Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is sustained in part and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent the foregoing decision.

The Notice of Entry of Appearance (Form EOIR-27) filed in this case is signed by David Stoller, Esquire, and therefore Mr. Stoller is the respondent’s attorney of record. However, the respondent’s appellate brief was filed over the signature of an attorney, apparently from Mr. Stoller’s law firm, who has not filed a Notice of Entry of Appearance in this matter. Because Mr. Stoller is the respondent’s attorney of record, the filing of a brief by a different attorney from his law firm is not permitted. Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual, §§ 2.3(d)-(f) and 3.3(b)(ii). Therefore the brief is subject to rejection. To prevent prejudice to the respondent we will accept the brief in the exercise of discretion, but we expect greater compliance with Board procedures in the future.

2

In an appellate pleading, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) urges us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision to reissue his original decision. However, that issue is distinct from the question presented in the respondent’s appeal, i.e., whether he merits section 212(c) relief in discretion, and therefore the DHS needed to raise it by means of an appeal. The DHS has not filed a notice of appeal, and its appellate pleading was submitted long after expiration of the 30-day appeal period. Thus, the merits of the respondent’s motion to reopen are not properly before us. We express no further opinion with regard to that issue.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a 30-year-old native and citizen of Tonga, appealed the Immigration Judge’s July 2, 2009, decision denying her motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a), based on an approved visa petition filed by her mother, and a waiver of inadmissibility. On April 13, 2009, the Immigration Judge found her removable, as charged, and granted her voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. Her application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(i), and accompanying waivers, was withdrawn and she was granted voluntary departure. The respondent did not appeal. Through a new attorney she filed a motion to reopen on June 10, 2009, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent entered the United States on or about February 18, 1997, as the unmarried child of a United States citizen, her mother. She was, in fact, already married on April 27, 1995. The respondent’s mother filed a new visa petition for the respondent as the married daughter of a United States citizen on or about September 13, 1998. This petition was approved and is now current. The Notice to Appear was issued on August 27, 2007. At the hearing it was revealed that the respondent had a child born in Tonga on March 18, 1999. The respondent now concedes she is not eligible for adjustment under section 245(i), because she was not in the United States on December 21, 2000. 8 U.S.C. § 245(i)(1)(C). The respondent admitted she had left the United States after her initial fraudulent entry. At the next hearing counsel withdrew the applications and accepted voluntary departure. The respondent contended in her motion to reopen that her counsel was ineffective by not pursuing an application under 245(a) and a waiver under 212(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(i), and that the record should be reopened and remanded. The Immigration Judge found no ineffective assistance of counsel had been proven, that she had not shown eligibility for relief upon reopening, and that the motion should be denied in discretion.
 
*2 The respondent has not complied substantially, or in part, with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She stated in her affidavit that she agreed to the withdrawal of her applications in return for voluntary departure which would allow her to return to the United States. She has not demonstrated she informed prior counsel that she intended to make a claim of ineffective assistance to the Board. The respondent has not shown she filed any complaint with the relevant authorities. Moreover, ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding is a denial of due process only “¿iºf the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from presenting his case.” Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). See also Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent must show that the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered her hearing unfair. Matter of B-B-, 23 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998).
 
It appears that the deficiencies in the record are attributable to the actions of the respondent. She admittedly lied on her applications by omitting any reference to her youngest child. She did not admit she had left the United States. Her overall credibility is in question. We find that there has been no showing that the respondent was prejudiced by her prior attorney’s performance. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 371 F.3d 771 (11th Cir. 2004). The preservation of her ability to voluntarily depart was a tactical decision with potential benefit to the respondent. As she conceded removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as an alien present in violation of the Act ¿now 237(a)(1)(B) of the Actº, and she is not eligible for adjustment of status, the failure to pursue a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), for her admission by fraud is moot. In these circumstances, we find the respondent’s due process rights have not been violated.
 
The respondent has asserted that she wishes a remand for consideration of her adjustment application and a waiver of inadmissibility. We uphold the finding that the respondent’s motion does not set forth a prima facie case of eligibility for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992). The respondent’s last entry was in 2003, but she has not shown that she was inspected or paroled into the United States. See Form I-601 Respondent’s Trial Brief, Exh. 9. Further, she was in unlawful immigration status on the date of filing her adjustment application and failed to maintain continuously a lawful status since entry. See 245(c)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1245(c)(2). Therefore, she is not eligible for adjustment of status.
 
*3 It was not necessary for the Immigration Judge to address the request to withdraw voluntary departure because the respondent never perfected her request for voluntary departure by filing the bond set by the Immigration Judge and she filed a post-hearing motion to reopen. Therefore, her voluntary departure grant lapsed and the order of removal became effective. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3) and (4).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Caridad Pastor Cardinale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tara L. Harris
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated August 20, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ motion to reopen their removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondents, natives and citizens of Gambia, filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) was personally served on the respondents and their counsel on March 12, 2008 (Exh. 3). The NOH contained notice of a July 9, 2008, Master hearing and a June 29, 2009, Individual hearing. The respondents failed to appear at their July 9, 2008, hearing, and were ordered removed in absentia on that date.
 
On July 21, 2008, the respondents, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, in which they contend that they did not receive notice of their “June 29, 2008,” hearing.¿FN1º Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, page 2. Attached to the motion were the respondents’ NOH and the Immigration Judge’s July 9, 2008, in absentia order. On August 20, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondents and their counsel had been personally served with the NOH, and they had not explained their failure to attend their hearing. The Immigration Judge also noted that no affidavit accompanied the motion. The respondents timely appealed that decision.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he or she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he or she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own.
 
While on appeal, the respondents have retained new counsel and have filed a “motion to reopen” based upon ineffective assistance of former counsel. This is essentially a motion to remand. Specifically, the respondents allege that former counsel advised them not to appear at their July 9, 2008, hearing because he would be filing their applications by mail. This claim is supported by an affidavit from the lead respondent. Her affidavit also restates her desire to apply for asylum and withholding of removal from Gambia. The Department of Homeland Security states in its brief on appeal that not all the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) have been satisfied, and no prejudice from any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel has been shown. However, we find that there has been Lozada compliance in this case, and that prejudice has been shown, as the respondents’ non-appearance at their hearing deprived them of the opportunity to present their persecution claim.
 
*2 Given all these circumstances, we find that exceptional circumstances existed excusing the respondents’ failure to appear for the July 9, 2008, hearing. We will therefore sustain the respondents’ appeal, reopen the proceedings, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondents to apply for relief from removal. See generally Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407 (6th Cir. 2003) (alien’s attorney’s failure to notify alien of asylum hearing, and subsequent fraud in advising alien that case was still pending, resulting in alien being ordered removed in absentia, was type of exceptional circumstances that could warrant recision of order of removal if alien filed motion to reopen within 180 days of date of order of removal); Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717 (6th Cir. 2003) (ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding will rise to the level of a due-process violation under the Fifth Amendment if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case).
 
Consequently, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN RE: KSENIA VLADIMIROVNA RANGEL, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY COREY FRANK RANGEL, PETITIONER
File: AXXX XX4 582 - Jacksonville, FL

IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda Hopkins
Associate Regional Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
*1 In a decision dated December 4, 2008, the Field Office Director (“Director”) denied the visa petition filed by the United States citizen petitioner for the beneficiary as his wife. The petitioner appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed. The request for oral argument is denied.
 
In a notice of intent to deny (“NOID”) dated October 17, 2008, the Director informed the petitioner of discrepancies that arose in the parties’ responses to questions at interviews conducted by the. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) on January 5, 2007. By means of the NOID, the petitioner was given the opportunity to provide additional evidence to rebut the inconsistencies. The NOID allotted the petitioner 30 days within which to submit rebuttal evidence. In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefit sought. See Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. See Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989). Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that the marriage was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws. See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975).
 
We find correct the Director’s determination in the December 2008 decision that the petitioner failed to respond to the October 2008 NOID and, consequently, failed to explain the cited interview discrepancies and failed to submit probative documentary evidence of a shared life so as to overcome the doubts raised by the discrepancies.
 
On appeal, the petitioner argues that he did not receive the NOID. However, the NOID reflects that it was sent to the petitioner at his last correct address as listed on the visa petition, 705 Water Oak Drive, Panama City Beach, Florida 32408. Although the petitioner contends that he changed his address, the record does not contain a change of address form or other proof as required to substantiate that he notified the DHS regarding the new address.¿FN1º Moreover, the NOID indicates that a copy was sent to the attorney who represented the petitioner before the DHS. Further, the petitioner acknowledges on appeal that the parties were provided actual notice regarding the NOID by the attorney through an October 2008 telephone call. To the extent the petitioner is claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We agree with the Director that a denial of the petition is justified under these circumstances, as the record does not demonstrate that the petitioner met his burden of establishing a bona fide marital relationship.
 
*2 The petitioner may, of course, file a new visa petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought, that of his spouse, under the immigration laws.
 
Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.¿FN2º
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX0 048 - Los Angeles, CA
October 20, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mike Razi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lee Crystal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 20, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 26, 2006. The Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The Immigration Judge also determined that even if the respondent were eligible for adjustment of status, the respondent should be denied that relief as a matter of discretion, given such factors as the respondent’s extensive criminal history and his history of violating this country’s immigration laws.
 
On February 3, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in which he claims he received deficient performance of counsel from his attorney during proceedings before the Board. Specifically, he complains that his attorney failed to send his appeal brief to the correct address and so it was not considered by the Board on appeal. He states that he learned about the attorney’s error during proceedings on his petition for review before the court of appeals. During those proceedings, the Government argued that the respondent failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in that he failed to file an appeal brief raising certain issues to the Board.
 
In addition to other evidence, the respondent has attached to his motion a copy of the appeal brief that was intended to be filed with the Board but that was sent to the wrong address. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen. The DHS argues that the respondent has not met the requirements for deficient performance of counsel claims as set out in Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
At the outset, we note that the Attorney General has recently vacated the decision in Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (providing that the Board and the Immigration Judges shall continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Given the totality of the circumstances as presented in the record, we will reopen proceedings sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (a), vacate our decision of February 20, 2008, and again consider the respondent’s appeal in light of the arguments advanced in his appeal brief. Upon consideration of the appeal brief, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal for the following reasons.
 
*2 We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See Matter of SH-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. See Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
First, we conclude that there is no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s factual findings. Next, considering the issue of discretion de novo, we conclude that even assuming the respondent were eligible for a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act and for adjustment of status, he should be denied adjustment as a matter of discretion. As the Immigration Judge correctly found, the record establishes that the respondent has a long criminal history and a history of violating immigration law that includes two prior deportations and subsequent unlawful re-entries (Tr. at 39, 46-50; Exh. 3; I.J. at 2-3).¿FN1 º Although the respondent has fathered three children, he did not benefit at his hearing from any testimony from his children or the mother of his children in which they explained the respondent’s role in their lives (I.J. at 4). Additionally, while the respondent complains that the Immigration Judge failed to take into account the fact that the respondent has lived in the United States since he was 12 years old, it is a matter of record that the respondent failed to actually establish his age of entry during his hearing, and there was varying evidence presented on this issue (Tr. at 43-45, 54-55, 58-59, 65, 73; I.J. at 3-4).
 
Even considering the respondent’s time in the United States, his three United States citizen children, his lack of criminal convictions since 1999, and his recent work history, the respondent has simply not presented factors that outweigh his criminal history and history of immigration violations. The grant of adjustment of status is a matter of discretion and administrative grace, and the respondent has the burden to show that discretion should be exercised on his behalf. See Matter of Leung, 16 I&N Dec. 12 (BIA 1976); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970). The respondent has failed to meet this burden. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: Proceedings are reopened pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision of February 20, 2008, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge did not consider whether the respondent was inadmissible and therefore ineligible for adjustment of status under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, based on his unlawful presence for 1 year or more within 10 years of seeking admission.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Holya
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s March 19, 2008, decision, denying her motion to reopen, except to grant voluntary departure.¿FN1º The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear at the hearing on April 17, 2007. The record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reopen, and in opening for the sole purpose of granting voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge issued a decision briefly concluding that the respondent had not established prima facie eligibility for any relief from removal and had not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to lodge an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge did not specifically address whether the motion was filed in a timely manner, how the respondent had failed to comply with Matter of Lozada and why the respondent’s contentions regarding her assertion that she was eligible for adjustment of status or cancellation of removal were incorrect. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (the Immigration Judge’s decision must fully explain the reasons for denial of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings). See also Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec, 462 (BIA 2002) (holding that because the Board’s fact finding ability on appeal is limited, it is important for Immigration Judges to include in clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law). In addition, the respondent did not seek reopening to apply for voluntary departure. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s grant order reopening to this relief was in error. Accordingly, the order granting voluntary departure is vacated. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and to enter a new decision. We express no opinion on the merits of the motion to reopen.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laine S. Posel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Renae M. Hansell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2008, decision denying his motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has requested that the Immigration Judge’s decision be affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard, and review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On July 11, 2008, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to the Ivory Coast, and his applications for relief from removal deemed abandoned when he failed to appear for his hearing. On August 8, 2008, the respondent, through attorney Shamsideen (Sam) O. Laguda (“Laguda”), filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, claiming that his prior counsel, attorney Michael Wallace (“Wallace”), misinformed him that the date of his hearing was July 17, 2008, rather than July 11, 2008. On August 20, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied this motion to reopen. On September 29, 2008, the respondent, again through attorney Laguda, filed a motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s August 20, 2008, decision. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider on October 20, 2008, and it is from this decision that the respondent, who has retained new counsel, has appealed.
 
On appeal, the respondent has not claimed, nor can we conclude, that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reconsider for the various reasons provided in the October 20, 2008, decision: that the motion to reconsider was untimely filed; the motion did not specify errors of law and fact in the prior decision denying the motion to reopen; and, in the alternative, the respondent did not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration and reopening of his proceedings or his prima facie eligibility for relief from removal. Based on the record before him on October 20, 2008, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
Rather than challenging the propriety of the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2008, decision, the respondent on appeal has presented evidence in support of a newly raised claim of ineffective assistance by attorney Laguda, who filed the unsuccessful motions to reopen and reconsider with the Immigration Court. We construe the respondent’s submissions on appeal as a motion to remand and reopen his proceedings based on new evidence. This motion will be denied.
 
*2 Although the respondent has alleged a claim of ineffective assistance against attorney Laguda, the respondent, through current undersigned counsel, has failed to comply with the filing requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), against attorney Wallace, who the respondent claimed misinformed him of his hearing date, caused his failure to appear, and caused his applications for relief from removal to be deemed abandoned. There is no evidence that the respondent filed a complaint against attorney Wallace with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and he has not explained why one was not filed. There is no verifiable evidence that attorney Wallace was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against him and was given an opportunity to respond.¿FN2º As found by the Immigration Judge in his previous decisions, the respondent has not established that ineffective assistance of counsel caused his failure to appear for his July 11, 2008, hearing, such that would constitute exceptional circumstances justifying the reopening of the proceedings and rescission of the in absentia removal order. On appeal, the respondent, who is now represented by new counsel, has still failed to establish a claim that ineffective assistance of counsel caused his failure to appear for his July 11, 2008, hearing. Accordingly, notwithstanding the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance against Laguda with respect to the motions filed, he has not established on appeal that he was prejudiced by attorney Laguda’s conduct. The respondent has not established that reopening of his proceedings is warranted. The following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand and reopen is denied.

We note that, on appeal, the respondent submitted a copy of a letter purportedly from attorney Wallace that the respondent claimed was filed with the Immigration Court on July 18, 2008. The record, however, does not show that this letter was filed with the Immigration Court. Not only is the letter’s origin unclear, but the letter is likewise unnotarized, unsworn, and unsigned by attorney Wallace.

On August 5, 2008, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen, arguing that his proceeding should be reopened due to ineffective assistance by his former attorney. On March 9, 2009, the Board denied the respondent’s motion pursuant to Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compean has now been vacated. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). On March 27, 2009, the Seventh Circuit dismissed the respondent’s petition for review from our May 27, 2008, decision, Joseph v. Holder, No. 08-2570, 2009 WL 792751 (7 th Cir. 2009).
 
On March 25, 2009, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our March 9, 2009, decision. In addition, the respondent has attached a number of exhibits to the motion so we will also consider his motion as a motion to reopen, but only to the extent the evidence raises new issues, as opposed to supplementing deficiencies in his original motion to reopen, which we denied on March 9, 2009. Mungongo v. Gonzales, 479 F.3d 531, 535 (7th Cir. 2007) (since argument not presented to the Board as a basis for reopening the alien’s removal proceedings at the time of her motion to reopen, Board’s failure to consider such information could not constitute a defect in the process by which it decided to deny the alien’s motion to reopen).
 
With respect to reconsideration, the motion is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent has not identified a material error of fact or law as of the time that our decision was rendered. Mungongo v. Gonzales, supra: Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Further, although Matter of Compean has been vacated, we find that under the pre-Compean standards, the respondent still has not demonstrated prejudice with respect to the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of the respondent’s request for a waiver under section 212(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), or our affirmance of that denial. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 577 F.2d 10 (1 Cir. 1988). See Jezierski v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 886, 891 (7th Cir. 2008)(query is whether proceeding might have different outcome if alien represented by competent counsel). With respect to withholding of removal, the respondent has not provided sufficient evidence or demonstrated how he might be entitled to such relief, and, as such, has not demonstrated prejudice.
 
*2 With respect to the additional evidence attached to the motion, most of it is an attempt to supplement the respondent’s original motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and, as such, is not properly before the Board. Mungongo v. Gonzales, supra. The respondent also asserts (not in his motion), but included as attachments, that his first attorney on appeal before the Board, Mr. Ivan Yacub, provided ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to file a motion to remand during the pendency of the appeal. The motion to reopen is denied as number-barred with respect to the additional evidence involving Mr. Yacub because the respondent has not demonstrated why these facts were not included in his original motion, and there has been no showing that the evidence was previously unavailable. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Mungongo v. Gonzales, supra, 479 F.3d at 535 n. 1. Further, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice because he hired a new attorney, Paschal O. Nwokocha, who filed the motion to reopen and remand during the pendency of the appeal and presented the evidence and arguments that Mr. Yacub was going to present, which motion the Board rejected. Accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice with respect to Mr. Yacub’s actions.
 
For these reasons, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonette Russell, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of Jamaica. On October 7, 2003, the Immigration Judge administratively closed these proceedings pursuant to a request of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On June 14, 2006, the DHS filed a motion to recalendar the proceedings. The Immigration Judge granted the motion and mailed the Notice of Hearing to Michael J. Williams, Esquire. The respondent did not appear for his hearing, and the Immigration Judge ordered his removal from the United States in absentia on September 5, 2006. On November 5, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen arguing that lack of notice and “exceptional circumstances” prevented his appearance at the hearing. The DHS indicated in response that it did not oppose reopening. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on January 28, 2008. On March 18, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reconsider arguing that he was not adequately notified of the hearing. The appeal will be sustained.
 
As stated, the Notice of Hearing in these proceedings was mailed to Michael J. Williams, Esquire. Documentation contained in the record reflects Mr. Williams as having represented the respondent before the DHS. Mr. Williams’ name is also handwritten on a Notice of Hearing dated February 18, 2003, that also contains the crossed name of Deborah M. Ferdinand. However, the record does not contain any evidence of Mr. Williams having filed a Notice of Appearance or having represented the respondent before the Immigration Court. It is thus unclear regarding why Mr. Williams was treated as the respondent’s representative. The fact that Mr. Williams represented the respondent before the DHS does not render him the respondent’s attorney of record in proceedings before the Immigration Court.
 
The Immigration Judge was correct to note that notice is proper if served on an alien’s counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5. However, the record contains no indication that Mr. Williams entered an appearance on behalf of the respondent. We therefore are unable to conclude that the respondent was adequately notified of his hearing, even though the Notice of Hearing may have been served on Mr. Williams. We find under these circumstances that the respondent did not receive proper notification of his September 5, 2006, hearing. We therefore need not address whether the respondent established that he was also the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and these proceedings are reopened and remanded for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandra A. Strempel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bernard Menendez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On March 24, 2009, the respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, filed a motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).
 
The motion was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). A final administrative order was issued in this case on July 20, 2006.¿FN1º
 
The respondent’s motion is premised, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former counsel, Mr. Jose Del Castillo.¿FN2º The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserts that the motion is untimely filed and that the respondent has failed to establish that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his case so as to equitably toll the 90-day motions deadline. See Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2009) (if the doctrine of equitable tolling is available, it applies only to those who exercise due diligence).
 
In reply, the respondent, by and through counsel, asserts that the motion is timely filed because the First Circuit’s decision is the final administrative order. See Respondent’s Reply to DHS’ Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Reopen at 3, filed with the Board on May 28, 2009. The respondent is incorrect. The Board issues the final administrative order, not the federal court. Moreover, the filing of a petition for review in federal court does not extend the 90-day motions deadline. See Matter of Susma, 22 I&N Dec. 947 (BIA 1999).
 
Although the respondent is misguided regarding the timeliness of the instant motion, we find that he acted diligently once he was aware of Mr. Del Castillo’s misconduct.¿FN3º Mr. Del Castillo represented the respondent before the Immigration Court, this Board and the First Circuit. He failed to submit documents to the Immigration Judge that were available and material to the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act. When he filed a motion to remand with this Board supported by these documents, it was properly denied because the documents were previously available. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen shall not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing). Because of Mr. Del Castillo’s misconduct, this material evidence was never considered by the Immigration Judge or the Board. Significantly, the respondent’s instant motion is supported by correspondence indicating that the Department of Labor accepted the respondent’s labor certification as properly filed on April 27, 2001. Had this document been presented to the Immigration Judge, the respondent would have been able to establish his eligibility for 245(i) treatment. The respondent has demonstrated prejudice resulting from Mr. Castillo’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 In light of the respondent’s diligence in pursuing his case once he had new counsel and Mr. Castillo’s obvious prejudicial misconduct, we will reopen these proceedings on our own motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The record will be remanded to afford the respondent the opportunity to apply for adjustment under section 245(i) of the Act.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos A. Cruz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lily C. Hsu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of El Salvador. She was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on May 14, 2007, after failing to appear for a hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on February 7, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied it on March 28, 2008, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that an “exceptional circumstance” prevented her from appearing for her heating. She indicates in her declaration that she was unable to afford to hire an attorney. She indicates that she was referred to a non-attorney supposedly versed in immigration law. According to the respondent, the non-attorney advised her not to appear for her hearing because she was not eligible for relief from removal, and she would be apprehended by immigration authorities if she appeared. The respondent argues that she is the victim of professional negligence. She further requests the Board to equitably toll the period for seeking reopening and reopen and remand these proceedings for a hearing.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recognizes that an alien may be denied due process if he or she receives negligent advice from an individual who falsely purports to be an attorney. See Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). The alien must, however, establish that he suffered prejudice from the conduct of a non-attorney, she was unaware of the fraud, and she remained ignorant of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on her part. See Lopez v. INS, supra.
 
In the instant case, the respondent admits in her declaration that there was no misrepresentation that the non-attorney was licensed to practice law. Under these circumstances, we do not find that the respondent received what may be tantamount to ineffective assistance to counsel. See, e.g., Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that there is a “crucial difference” between ineffective assistance of counsel and ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant); see also Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943, 946 (9th Cir. 1999) (concluding that the erroneous advice of an immigration consultant does not constitute an exceptional circumstance requiring reopening of the proceedings). The respondent avoided her hearing based on a non-attorney’s advice despite being notified to appear and of the consequences for failing to do so. It is inappropriate to equitably toll the 180-day period for filing her motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion as untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Judith Goodman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the respondent’s motion. In our decision dated December 29, 2008, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found her removable and denied her request for a continuance. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen, filed on July 14, 2009, is untimely. However, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel. In Matter ofCompean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
The respondent has met the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and has adequately demonstrated prejudice. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004) (to show prejudice, the alien only needs to show that he has plausible grounds for relief). A visa petition filed by the respondent’s United States citizen spouse on her behalf was approved on April 10, 2008. However, former counsel did not file a motion to remand, even though the respondent’s appeal remained pending before the Board until December 29, 2008. Counsel also failed to timely submit a motion to reopen. Either a motion to remand or a motion to reopen, timely filed, could have presented a plausible basis for granting the motion. Finally, the respondent has shown due diligence in pursuing this matter. See Sun v. Mukasey, 555 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir. 2009) (concluding that the alien was entitled to equitable tolling where she acted with due diligence).
 
Thus, we will equitably toll the time limit, grant reopening, and remand the case to allow the respondent to pursue an adjustment application. Because we will grant the respondent’s motion, her stay request has been rendered moot.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Guadagno, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated July 9, 2008. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on July 29, 1998, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The facts culminating in this appeal are as follows: The respondent, a lawful permanent resident, was personally served with the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) on May 29, 1998, upon applying for readmission after a trip abroad on the basis of his criminal record comprised of two narcotics and one fraud conviction (Exhs. 1, 3). The Notice to Appear in the record of proceeding directed the respondent to appear at the Immigration Court located at 26 Federal Plaza, Room 10000, New York, NY 10278 on July 29, 1998 (Exh. 1). However, the Immigration Court address on the Notice to Appear that was served upon the respondent, although otherwise identical to the Notice to Appear in the record of proceeding, did not indicate the room number at which the respondent was directed to appear (I.J. at 2).¿FN1º The respondent failed to appear as directed and was ordered removed in absentia on July 29, 1998.
 
Nothing was heard again from the respondent until May 13, 2008, when the respondent filed the underlying motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal (I.J. at 1; Respondent’s M.T.R.). In the motion to reopen the respondent presented two contradictory theories of relief. First, the respondent argued (and renews his argument on appeal) that his failure to appear was due to deficient notice resulting from the incomplete Immigration Court address indicated on the Notice to Appear that was served upon him on May 29, 1998 (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s M.T.R. at 4-6; Respondent’s Br. at 7). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (2009). Second, the respondent argued (and renews his argument on appeal) that his failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” created by the ineffective assistance of the counsel (or individual falsely representing himself as legal counsel) he retained to represent him in these proceedings (I.J. at 1-2; Respondent’s M.T.R. at 6-9; Respondent’s Br. at 6-7). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) of the Act (defining “exceptional circumstances”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996) (“¿Wºe note that one must look to the “totality of circumstances” to resolve this issue of exceptional circumstances.”). However, the Immigration Judge rejected each theory and denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, and this appeal ensued.
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge on both accounts. First, the respondent’s deficient notice theory based on the incomplete Immigration Court address on the Notice to Appear is baseless because the respondent, by his own admission in the affidavit he submitted in support of the motion to reopen, never went to the New York Immigration Court or otherwise attempted to appear at the July 29, 1998 hearing (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. D, page 2). Thus, even assuming that the minor discrepancy between the address on the Notice to Appear in the record of proceeding and the address on the Notice to Appear served upon the respondent were sufficiently significant to cause a delay in finding the actual hearing room, that would not amount to a failure of notice, but at most would provide an excuse for a late arrival. The respondent cannot demonstrate any harm resulting from the discrepancy, however, because he never attempted to appear for the July 29, 1998, hearing as directed.
 
Second, while the respondent’s allegation that his failure to appear at the July 29, 1998, hearing was due to the fact that the former counsel misinformed him that the hearing had been continued would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, we find no clear error in the refusal of the Immigration Judge to fully credit those allegations, for the reasons provided in the July 9, 2008, written decision (I.J. at 1-2). See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008) (“We now join our sister circuits in concluding that, under BIA precedent applicable to the pre-1996 version of the INA as well as its current iteration, a lawyer’s inaccurate advice to his client concerning an immigration hearing date can constitute ‘exceptional circumstances’ excusing the alien’s failure to appear at a deportation hearing ¿º and meriting the reopening of an in absentia deportation order ¿º.” (citing Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 801-02 (5th Cir. 2007); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937-38 (9th Cir. 2003); Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54, 59 n.4 (2d Cir. 2005)); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact in this regard are clearly erroneous because the Immigration Judge “fail¿edº to consider” the respondent’s affidavit (Respondent’s Br. at 5). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(1); see also United States v. National Ass’n of Real Estate Bds., 339 U.S. 485, 495 (1950) (stating that a factual finding is not “clearly erroneous” merely because there are two permissible views of the evidence); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (stating that the Board must defer to the factual determinations of an Immigration Judge in the absence of clear error). However, we would point out that the Immigration Judge specifically compared the documentary evidence presented (as well as not presented) in support of the motion to reopen with the statements in the respondent’s affidavit and reasonably concluded that the documentary evidence raised significant questions and did not adequately corroborate the respondent’s affidavit (I.J. at 1-2; Respondent’s Br. at 5).
 
*3 Finally, even were we inclined to agree with the respondent that the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and, again, we are not, the respondent’s motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances would still be untimely, and the respondent’s failure to take any action in the interest of his case from the entry of the in absentia order on July 29, 1998, until he retained new counsel and filed the underlying motion to reopen on May 13, 2008, would preclude application of the equitable tolling doctrine developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Iavorsky v. INS, supra, because the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Accordingly, the following order will be entered:

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriel S. Perez, Esquire¿FN1º
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 12, 2009. The Board affirmed a decision of an Immigration Judge, who found that the respondent, who has been convicted of knowingly and willfully aiding and abetting the illegal entry of aliens, had abandoned the right to file an application for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(a). In a timely motion to reopen filed on May 5, 2009, the respondent blames former counsel Jose S. Tellez for his cancellation application being deemed abandoned.
 
The motion is unaccompanied by a detailed affidavit from the respondent that would support his claims against Tellez. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)(among other requirements not satisfied by the respondent, ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by detailed affidavit).¿FN2º Moreover, at the February 4, 2008, removal hearing, the Immigration Judge remarked that, despite Tellez saying that the failure to submit the application was “partly my fault”, Tr. at 14, the respondent himself was also to blame for the application being deemed waived, in that he had been advised about the requirements for submitting an application for relief (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 16, 19). The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Guadagno, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On December 18, 2008, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for a waiver of inadmissability under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen the proceedings. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will grant the motion.
 
Based on the respondent’s testimony and evidence at his removal hearing, the Immigration Judge found that he could not determine whether the respondent maintained a lawful domicile in the United States as a permanent resident for at least 7 consecutive years preceding the filing of the application, and he concluded that the respondent failed to demonstrate statutory eligibility for a section 212(c) waiver. The Board found no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding of fact, and we accordingly affirmed his decision.
 
In his motion, the respondent claims that his former attorney’s mishandling of his case resulted in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the section 212(c) waiver. Specifically, he asserts that his former attorney failed to properly prepare him for the removal hearing, and he failed to solicit available evidence from the respondent in support of his application for the waiver. See Motion to Reopen at 14. In support of his claim that he is returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of 7 consecutive years, the respondent has now submitted a copy of his passport bearing exit and entry stamps, as well as sworn statements from friends and relatives. He has also submitted an affidavit describing his relationship with his former attorney (Tab A), a copy of a complaint filed against his former attorney with the New York State Bar Association (Exhibit K), and a copy of a letter to his former attorney informing him of the allegations against him (Tab I).
 
We find that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54, 59 (2nd Cir. 2005). Upon consideration of the motion and supporting evidence, we will grant the respondent’s timely unopposed motion to reopen, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary Silbiger, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 17, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was previously ordered removed from the United States on August 4, 2004. The respondent departed the United States, subsequently re-entered illegally, and was ordered removed from the United States again on March 14, 2005. The respondent illegally returned to the United States, was arrested by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and filed a motion to reopen on February 3, 2009, with the Immigration Court alleging that (1) the Immigration Judge erroneously informed the respondent that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), due his drug possession conviction and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and this timely appeal followed.
 
Upon our de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). We first address the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge wrongfully informed the respondent at his August 4, 2004, hearing that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal due to his conviction for possession of cocaine, which constituted an aggravated felony. The respondent cites to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47 (2006) and the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 905 (9th Cir. August 24, 2004) as support for his contention that his conviction for possession of cocaine did not constitute an aggravated felony “drug trafficking crime.” However, neither of these cases had been decided at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision on August 4, 2004. Rather, at the time of the Immigration Judge’s August 4, 2004, decision, the Ninth Circuit had yet to issue a precedent decision deciding whether a state felony drug offense is an aggravated felony for immigration purposes if the offense is not punishable as a felony under federal drug laws. See Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 910. Absent a Ninth Circuit decision on the issue, the Board would have applied the Ninth Circuit’s rule used in the sentencing enhancement context to determine whether the respondent’s conviction was for an aggravated felony. See id. at 911-912; Matter of Yanez-Garcia, 23 I & N Dec. 390 (BIA 2002). As the Immigration Judge indicated in his decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Ninth Circuit’s decision in U.S. v. Rios-Beltran, 361 F3d. 1204, 1207 (9th Cir. 2004), wherein the court defined an aggravated felony as encompassing any drug offense that is: (1) punishable under Controlled Substances Act, and (2) a felony under either federal or state law, would have controlled. Under the definition employed in U.S. v. Rios-Beltra, supra, the respondent’s conviction for possession of cocaine constituted an aggravated felony that would have rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal. Hence, we find that the Immigration Judge did not err in stating to the respondent that he was likely ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act at his hearing on August 4, 2004 (Tr. at 19-21).
 
*2 We next address the respondent’s argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, due to counsel’s failure to appear for the respondent’s hearing and counsel’s failure to advise the respondent of his eligibility to apply for cancellation of removal. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his attorney’s failure to appear. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice). The respondent specifically alleges prejudice based upon his counsel’s failure to advise him of his eligibility for cancellation of removal; however, as discussed infra, the respondent was not eligible for cancellation of removal or any other form of relief at the time of his August 4, 2004, hearing, due to his conviction for an aggravated felony.
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge did not provide the respondent with a full and fair hearing that comported with due process requirements. At his initial hearing, the respondent’s counsel waived the reading of the respondent’s rights in removal proceedings (Tr. at 2). At the respondent’s subsequent hearing, when the respondent’s counsel failed to appear, the Immigration Judge offered to postpone the respondent’s hearing until a later date when his attorney could be present (Tr. at 8); however, the respondent indicated that he was “going to dismiss” his attorney anyway and that he wished to proceed with his hearing unrepresented, despite the Immigration Judge’s further offer to give the respondent more time to decide how to proceed with his immigration case (Tr. at 8-11). In the absence of representation, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge carefully explained the relief that was available to the respondent and his concerns with regard to the respondent’s eligibility for these forms of relief (Tr. at 13-22). Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the Immigration Judge violated the respondent’s due process rights.
 
Additionally, with regard to the respondent’s argument that his waiver of the right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision was not knowing and intelligent, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge clearly asked the respondent if he understood his right to appeal (Tr. at 22). The respondent indicated that he understood his right to appeal and that he accepted the Immigration Judge’s decision as final (Tr. at 22). The Immigration Judge even further clarified the consequences of waiving appeal for the respondent by telling him that he could not later change his mind and file an appeal (Tr. at 22). Despite this further warning, the respondent indicated that he still wanted to accept the Immigration Judge’s decision (Tr. at 22). As such, we find that the respondent’s waiver of his right to appeal to the Board was knowing and voluntary.
 
*3 Lastly, we find that the respondent’s motion does not establish an “exceptional” situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JOSE IGNACIO HEREDIA
File: A097 917 015 - Los Fresnos, TX
September 14, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has filed a motion to reconsider our prior decision. He also moves to reopen for the conduct of a new hearing and for consideration of his newly-prepared affidavit. The motion will be denied.
 
Insofar as the respondent seeks reconsideration of our July 10, 2009, decision dismissing his appeal, we find no error of fact or law in that decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
In moving to reopen, the respondent seeks consideration of his new personal affidavit in which he contends that (1) his guilty plea underpinning his September 2008 state court conviction for trafficking in cocaine was not knowingly and intelligently made because he was not informed of its immigration consequences; (2) he misinterpreted the information provided by the Immigration Judge, and had little to no knowledge of immigration law or the consequences he faced by accepting the allegations that were made; and (3) that the Immigration Judge erred in allowing him to “plead guilty” to the alleged charges without an attorney being present. See Motion to Reopen (“Motion”) at 7; see also Motion at 4-5. In the motion itself, he claims that his right to counsel at his immigration hearing was violated. See Motion at 3.
 
It is well settled that an alien cannot collaterally attack the legitimacy of a criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See e.g., Zinnanti v. INS, 651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir. 1981) (holding that “whatever the merits of ¿an alien’sº ineffective assistance of counsel claim may be, ¿heº cannot collaterally attack the legitimacy of his otherwise valid state criminal conviction in the deportation proceedings”); Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529 (BIA 1992), and the cases cited therein. Although the respondent may want, or may have already initiated proceedings, to collaterally attack his conviction, such circumstances do not affect his present removability. See generally Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750, 751-52 (BIA 1993). On this record, the respondent’s conviction is final for purpose of the immigration laws, and he is removable as an alien convicted of a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance. See I.J. at 3; Group Exh. 2 (record of conviction).
 
As to the respondent’s due process-based claims concerning his proceedings in Immigration Court, there is no indication that his privilege of being represented by an attorney at no expense to the Government was violated, or that his hearing was not conducted in a fundamentally fair manner. At his February 11, 2009, hearing the Immigration Judge asked if he had an attorney to represent him, and he replied that he did not and needed time to look for representation. A continuance was granted for this purpose (Tr. at 2). At the next hearing the respondent appeared without counsel. The Immigration Judge specifically asked him if he was requesting more time to get an attorney, to which he replied “No” (Tr. at 6). Despite the respondent’s current allegations, there has been no showing that his counsel privilege or due process rights were violated in his removal proceedings.
 
*2 We also note that although the respondent’s alienage was established by his own admissions at the hearing which remain undisputed, his removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), was independently established by his certified record of conviction (Tr. at 6-8). See I.J. at 2-3; Group Exh. 2. Contrary to his declaration representations, he did not accept the allegations leveled against him by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and he did not “plead guilty” to the charges filed against him in Immigration Court. See I.J. at 2; Exh. 1 (Notice to Appear reflecting (by separate handwritten insertions by the Immigration Judge) the respondent’s having denied both factual allegation #4 and his removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act).
 
The respondent also asserts that his removal will result in extreme hardship to his wife and children. See Motion at 2, 4-5. However, he has not identified any form of relief for which he is eligible. See I.J. at 4-6 (discussing the respondent’s ineligibility for various forms of relief). Moreover, we do not have the authority to grant an otherwise removable alien permission to remain in the United States solely for humanitarian reasons. Only the DHS has that authority. See generally Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982) (noting that deferred action status, giving a person permission to remain in the United States indefinitely, is matter of prosecutorial discretion); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 241.6(a) and 1241.6(a) (regarding administrative stays of removal).
 
Further consideration of the new evidence submitted with this motion would not change the result reached in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110 (1988).
 
Based on the foregoing considerations, the motion is denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerald Karikari, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eileen McCrohan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has filed a motion to reconsider and reopen the Board’s February 6, 2009, decision denying her motion to reopen. The motion to reconsider and reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied because she has failed to identify any error of fact or law in our February 6, 2009, decision. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C) (a motion to reconsider shall specify the errors of fact and law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority). She simply restates her claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel and that she is eligible for adjustment of status. We considered the respondent’s arguments before rendering a decision in this case. We decline to revisit them.
 
Since the respondent filed her motion to reopen a new standard applies to aliens raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (the Board and Immigration Judges should apply pre-Compean standards), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). Under both Compean and pre-Compean standards, the alien must show that she exercised due diligence so as to warrant the equitable tolling of the 90-day motions deadline. As we previously determined, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000) (finding that aliens relying on equitable tolling must establish, inter alia, that they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled).
 
The instant motion constitutes a motion to reopen insofar as it is supported by documentation. See section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(B) (a motion to reopen shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other material evidence). The motion to reopen will be denied as time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Act, and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Even if we considered the proffered documentation (some of which was previously submitted), it would not alter our prior determination that the respondent failed to establish that she is the beneficiary of an approved or pending employment-based immigrant visa petition (Form I-140). Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen will be denied.
  
ORDER: The motion to reconsider and reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carol G. Bridge
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 26, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. On appeal, the respondent requests that the Board find “exceptional circumstances” or another general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon our de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). As an initial matter, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and numerically barred, inasmuch as it was not submitted within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s December 3, 2003, decision and is the respondent’s second motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). We also note that this Board does not have the authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or other general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007).
 
Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent seems to argue that her failure to depart the United States under her voluntary departure order was a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, i.e., her failure to depart was not voluntary, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen failed to comply with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Zmijewska, supra, at 91 (noting that the penalties under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act were not intended to apply to every alien who failed to depart within the voluntary departure period but was meant to limit the penalties to only those aliens whose failure to depart was voluntary). The respondent’s motion to reopen did not contain a personal affidavit setting forth her agreement with former counsel, evidence that former counsel was informed of the allegations against him, or evidence that a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. We recognize that the respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal regarding her claim of ineffective assistance; however, we do not consider evidence first offered on appeal as our review is a review of the record created before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). The proper time to submit evidence is before an Immigration Judge at an evidentiary hearing. We note that where evidence is new or previously unavailable it may support a remand. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1), (4). However, the respondent has failed to establish that the information contained in the documents she seeks to offer on appeal could not have been produced before the Immigration Judge. In light of the foregoing, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Susana Abarca, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 By an untimely motion filed on February 26, 2009, the respondent seeks to reopen proceedings that were last before the Board on September 8, 2004, based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(I) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). However, because the respondent’s motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel we will consider whether the 90-day time limit should be equitably tolled. The respondent’s claim is premised upon the failure of former counsel to file a brief in support of the appeal, which was the basis for the dismissal of the respondent’s appeal by the Board. Although the respondent’s motion is premised upon the ineffective assistance rendered by former counsel, the respondent has not properly asserted that claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25, I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). Therefore, the motion to reopen is, hereby, denied.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorraine L. Griffin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has submitted a motion, which in substance is a motion to reconsider taking issue with the Board’s February 23, 2009, decision concerning the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The pending motion does not cause the Board to reconsider its February 23, 2009, decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006)(a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error, assert that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, or argue a change in law). In that decision, the Board declined to reissue a November 7, 2008, decision, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board also granted the respondent’s motion to withdraw the request for voluntary departure, citing Dada v. Mukasey, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2319 (2008) (recognizing an alien’s unilateral right to withdraw a request for voluntary departure before the voluntary departure period expires). The DHS argues, in the pending motion, that the Board’s February 23, 2009, decision “does not contain an order of removal”, so the Board should amend its decision. However, the Board’s November 7, 2008, final order stated that
In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
Therefore, contrary to the DHS’ motion, the Board has issued an order of removal in this case, effective where, as here, the respondent has elected not to voluntarily depart the United States. The DHS’ motion to reconsider is, therefore, denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case, last before us when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen in an order dated November 30, 2004, is now before us on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Samperio-Lopez v. Holder, 321 Fed. Appx. 646 (9th Cir. 2009) (unpublished). The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, filed a motion to reopen our July 16, 2004, decision affirming without opinion the November 18, 2002, Immigration Judge’s decision. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had abandoned his application for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (1995); 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), when he failed to comply with the fingerprints requirement.
 
In its decision, the Ninth Circuit found that the respondent had substantially complied with the procedural requirements to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and that this Board erred when it determined otherwise. The court also noted that, at the time of our decision, we did not have the benefit of the intervening decision in Cui v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 1289 (9th Circ. 2008), which held that the denial of a continuance for fingerprint processing prior to April 2005 may be an abuse of discretion. It appears that the respondent’s case may come within the holding in Cui. A remand is therefore necessary for further consideration of the issue of the fingerprints in accordance with Cui, and for consideration of the application for a 212(c) waiver if appropriate. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s order of November 30, 2004, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision and the decision of the court.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adam S. Elman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 16, 2008, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 24, 2007, decision denying her motion to reconsider the denial of her prior motion to reopen proceedings, which was based on lack of proper notice, and to rescind the in absentia order entered against her on December 12, 2006. At that time, we found no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s motion to reconsider was untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) (30-day time limit for filing motion to reconsider).
 
On January 16, 2009, the respondent filed another motion to reopen, presenting new evidence to show that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was not served on her at the most recent address that she had provided to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and thus that she was not properly notified of the scheduled removal proceedings. She urges that any time and number limits should be equitably tolled because her prior attorney — who represented her before the DHS, filed the prior motions on her behalf with the Immigration Court, and filed the appeal with the Board — provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel where he did not present all evidence pertaining to the change of address that had been filed with the DHS prior to initiation of the removal proceedings.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has declined to rule on whether equitable tolling is available where an alien claims ineffective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33, 2009 WL 2100615 (1st Cir. Jul. 17, 2009). This Board, however, has generally accepted the concept of equitable tolling, so long as certain criteria are met, including a showing of due diligence and prejudice. Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2008, 2009). Although there are no time limits on a motion to reopen alleging lack of proper notice of removal proceedings, there are number limits. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) and 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) & (c)(7)(A) (providing no time limit on motions to reopen claiming a lack of proper notice, but providing that only one may be filed); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Thus, the question here is whether the respondent has shown that the number limit should be tolled because of the actions of her prior counsel.
 
*2 We find that tolling of the number limit is warranted in this case, where the respondent has shown she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s failure to present dispositive evidence to the Immigration Court in connection with her first motion to reopen alleging lack of proper notice. In the alternative, we would reopen sua sponte under the circumstances of this case. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent’s motion complies with the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in that she has provided her affidavit setting forth the agreement with prior counsel, filed a complaint against prior counsel, and notified prior counsel of her claims against him and provided an opportunity for him to respond. She submits evidence showing that she notified the DHS of an updated address as early as January 2005, well prior to the time the DHS served the NTA in this case on the respondent at her former address of record in July 2005 (Motion, tab C, USCIS notices dated February 2005 through August 2005; Exh. 1). This evidence establishes that the NTA was not properly served on the respondent, as it was not sent to her at the last address she had provided to the DHS. Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). She therefore was prejudiced by her former attorney’s failure to include this evidence in the prior motion to reopen.¿FN1º Consequently, we find it appropriate to grant the motion to reopen, vacate the prior in absentia removal order, and remand for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: These removal proceedings are reopened, and the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of removal dated December 12, 2006, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

In addition, to the extent that service of the NTA on her personally by the DHS in October 2005 might have been considered to overcome the defect in service of the NTA, it still cannot overcome the fact that subsequent notices of hearings, sent by the Immigration Court to the respondent on January 5, 2006, August 9, 2006, and October 31, 2006 (Exh. 1A), were served at her old address that was not the most current address she had provided to the DHS prior to the initiation of the proceedings. Moreover, her prior counsel’s failure to file an appearance with the Immigration Court when he was hired to represent her in November 2005 in the removal proceedings, as well as his failure to advise the Immigration Court of her updated address, compounded the notice problems in this case and also resulted in prejudice to her (Motion, tab M, ¶¶ 8-13).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Haitham E. Ballout, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer L. Castro
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On July 13, 2009, the respondent filed this appeal from the Immigration Judge’s July 7, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on April 16, 2009. In the motion, the respondent moved to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) for “exceptional circumstances,” namely that his prior attorney specifically advised him not to appear at the removal hearing. In the motion, the respondent’s attorney explained that the respondent was in detention, and that the motion would be amended upon the arrival of correspondence from the respondent. The Immigration Judge, however, correctly noted that the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and denied the motion.
 
With his appeal brief, the respondent has submitted documentation in compliance with the Lozada requirements. We note that this material was submitted within 180 days of the initial in absentia order, and thus would have been timely had it been filed initially with the Immigration Judge. Given this record, we will construe the respondent’s appeal to be a timely supplement to his motion to reopen. We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a new adjudication of the motion to reopen, and for the entry of a new order. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura A. Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board issued its final administrative decision on December 5, 2008. On July 10, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen is untimely (filed more that 90 days after our decision on the merits). See Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, essentially seeks reopening based on equitable tolling, contending that his former accredited representative provided ineffective assistance of Counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes reopening, which will be denied.
 
On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision setting forth standards for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, but this decision was recently vacated by the current Attorney General. Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). Pending rulemaking procedures, the Board was directed to “apply the pre-Compean standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of when such motions were filed.” Aliens raising an ineffective assistance claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-133 (2d Cir. 2000). Aliens seeking to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim must establish 1) that counsel’s performance was so ineffective as to have impinged on the fundamental fairness of the proceedings because counsel’s conduct was such that competent counsel would have acted otherwise; and 2) counsel’s performance must have resulted in prejudice to the alien. See Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005), citing U.S.v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 2001).
 
The respondent asserts that he has diligently but unsuccessfully attempted to “communicate with” Reverend Robert Vitaglione, his former accredited representative. However, as the respondent has not provided any copies of any written correspondence he has sent to Reverend Vitaglione or shown that he made Reverend Vitaglione aware that he filed a motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance claim, the respondent’s assertion is insufficient to establish that Reverend Vitaglione has been informed of the nature of the respondent’s complaints and given an opportunity to respond thereto as required. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Consequently, the respondent has not established that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the time limit on reopening based on the ineffective assistance claim. The additional evidence concerning country conditions in Haiti also submitted in support of the motion was available at the time of the hearing in 2008 and does not establish changed country conditions in Haiti warranting reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 168 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

August 20, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Raymond Fasano, Esquire
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
On April 27, 2009, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The Immigration Judge on December 1, 2008, found the respondent subject to removal, and denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. The respondent, who is from the Dominican Republic, filed a timely motion to reopen on July 23, 2009. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The motion presents a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against the respondent’s former attorney, contending that counsel did not assist the respondent to submit an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act.¿FN1º
 
A respondent claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel must show “a reasonable probability of prejudice resulting from ¿hisº former representation.” Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007)(citation omitted); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent fails to show such prejudice. A decision whether to grant cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act is a discretionary determination. Bencosme de Rodriguez v. Ashcroft, 433 F.3d 163, 164 (1st Cir. 2005); Matter of Almanza-Arenas, 24 I&N Dec. 771, 774 (BIA 2009). The Board concluded, in its April 27, 2009, decision, that:
We are unpersuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that voluntary departure is not warranted in the exercise of discretion upon evaluation of the relevant factors, in view of the serious criminal charge of insurance fraud related to arson that was pending against the respondent in New York. The Immigration Judge was within her authority to deem that adverse factor to outweigh the positive factors presented by the respondent, including his 23-year presence in the United States and his ties to 2 United States children and to a United States citizen fiancee who is the children’s mother. See Tr. at 7-13; I.J. at 2-3; Matter of Thomas, 21 I&N Dec. 20 (BIA 1995). We have considered the respondent’s appellate statements, in which he acknowledges that his criminal case remains ongoing and asserts that he plans to marry his fiancee, who then will file a visa petition on his behalf. However, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure as a matter of discretion.
 
 
*2 Given the Board’s agreement that the respondent did not merit voluntary departure as a matter of discretion, there is not a “reasonable probability” that he would have been granted cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion, even had such relief been pursued at the removal hearing. The motion argues that counsel should have requested a continuance pending the disposition of the criminal case (Respondent’s Mot., at 7). In fact, counsel did seek “administrative closure”, but the request was opposed by the DHS and denied by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 12).
 
The respondent now presents an email, apparently from a prosecutor, stating that the respondent pled to criminal trespass after the removal hearing (Respondent’s Mot., Exh. O). There is no evidence to substantiate the email. Moreover, the fact that the respondent may have pled guilty to criminal trespass, rather than a more serious conviction, does not warrant reopening of these proceedings.
 
The motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
David Kaplan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mary H. Burford
Service Center Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
*1 The petitioner has appealed from the Vermont Service Center Director’s March 21, 2007, denial of her self-petition (Form I-360) as a widow of a United States citizen. The denial was based on a finding that the Form I-360 was not filed within 2 years of the death of her United States citizen spouse. The Director further noted that, even if he had jurisdiction over the self-petition, the petition would be denied as there was a discrepancy between the name of the petitioner and her name on the marriage certificate. He further noted that there was a lack of evidence of the termination of all prior marriages of both the petitioner and her United States citizen spouse, who died on September 20, 2004, prior to the adjudication of a visa petition (Form I-130) that he had filed on March 16, 2000, on her behalf.
 
We have reviewed the record, including the decision of the Director and the arguments made on appeal, and we find that the record should be remanded. The petitioner raised the issue of ineffective assistance of her former counsel and argued that the negligence of her former counsel resulted in the untimely filing of the Form I-360. The Director did not acknowledge or address this argument. We do not make any determination on the merits of whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may equitably toll the Director’s jurisdiction in this case, however, we find it appropriate to remand the matter to give the Director an opportunity to address this argument in the first instance. On remand, the Director may consider any additional evidence to determine if there was ineffective assistance of counsel that whether that could toll the two-year filing period for the filing of the Form I-360 in this case.
 
The petitioner should also be prepared to address the discrepancy in her name and any evidence of the termination of all prior marriages of the petitioner and her spouse. There appears to be evidence regarding both these matters in the record that should likewise be considered by the Director in the first instance.
 
If, upon review of any additional evidence submitted, and of the record as a whole, the VSC director determines that the Form I-360 petition should again be denied, he should issue a decision clearly setting forth the reasons for the denial, and should promptly forward the record to the Board in the event the petitioner files an appeal.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the VSC Director for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Frick, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah C. Schreck
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.¿FN1º
 
The respondent’s conditional permanent resident status was terminated in 1998, and he was charged with marriage fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), and being subject to removal under sections 237(a)(1)(A) and (D) of the Act. The respondent was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge on October 15, 1999, and the Board affirmed this decision without opinion on March 12, 2003. The Board denied motions to reopen on November 21, 2003, and February 19, 2009. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Board’s final order of removal in 2004. Zhen v. Ashcroft, 110 Fed.Appx. 795 (9th Cir. Sept. 22, 2004)(unpublished). The respondent, who is from China, filed another motion to reopen on June 18, 2009. The motion was filed many years out of time, and is barred by numerical limitations for motions to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The motion presents a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against 2 former attorneys, contending that they did not assist the respondent to request a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, either before the Immigration Judge, or earlier before the Board.¿FN2º
 
A party claiming that equitable tolling applies to the reopening deadline based on claimed ineffective assistance of counsel must show that he acted with reasonable diligence. Escobar v. Holder, 567 F.3d 466, 480 (9th Cir. 2009); Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669, 673 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent fails to provide an adequate reason to justify tolling the motions deadline for such a long period of time. DHS Opp., at 6. Significantly, the respondent made a decision, after years had gone by since the Board’s final decision, and after being detained in October, 2008, not to hire “competent legal counsel” to advise him, until May, 2009 (Respondent’s Mot., at ¶¶ 26-28).¿FN3º
 
In any event, under Ninth Circuit case law, a respondent claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that counsel failed to perform with “sufficient competence,” Alcala v. Holder, 563 F.3d 1009, 1019 (9th Cir. 2009); Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 771 (9th Cir. 2008), such that proceedings are “so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting ¿hisº case.” Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir. 2009). The respondent “must also show substantial prejudice by demonstrating that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id. (citation omitted).
 
*2 As the DHS argues, the respondent fails to show such prejudice (DHS Opp., at 4, 6). A decision whether to grant a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act is a discretionary determination. San Pedro v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 1156, 1157 (9th Cir. 2005); Matter of Tijam, 22 I&N Dec. 308, 412-13 (BIA 1998). After considering all the evidence, the Immigration Judge concluded that: “… the respondent is not eligible for voluntary departure, because he does not possess good moral character. He does possess bad character, and so that form of relief is denied” (I.J. at 13). Given the Immigration Judge’s conclusion, as the DHS argues, “it is unlikely that the Immigration Judge would have granted a discretionary waiver … even if it had been requested” (DHS Opp., at 4).
 
The respondent also should have met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), but did not. Most significantly, the respondent has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explained why no filing was made. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603-605 (BIA 1996); Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir. 2008); Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587-88 (9th Cir. 2006) (Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that claims are clear and obvious); cf. Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 896 (9th Cir. 2008)(bar complaint not required where attorney already suspended). The respondent’s assertion that counsel may have acted “in good faith” is not an adequate explanation for failing to meet this requirement. DHS Opp., at 3. The motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied, and the request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

The motion argues that the respondent should be released from custody (Respondent’s Mot., at ¶ 81). However, as bond proceedings are separate and apart from removal proceedings, this issue is not appropriately before the Board in the context of this motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d).

Pending rulemaking procedures, the Board was directed to “apply the pre-Compean standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of when such motions were filed.”

The respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge failed to inform him about the possibility of a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act is not a basis for equitable tolling of the motion deadline, as the DHS argues (DHS Opp., at 5). In any event, just as the respondent fails to show reasonable diligence in raising his late-filed and number-barred claim again former counsel, he fails to show diligence in raising this argument.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ADAO DE CASTRO-MAMBUANDA
File: A095 132 480 - Tucson, AZ
August 5, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa R. Pannone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case has a long procedural history that is reflected in the Immigration Judge’s decision. We briefly note that the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on August 14, 2008, after failing to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on March 23, 2009, but it was denied on April 22, 2009. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We will first address whether the respondent received the proper notices in these proceedings. The respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, and the Notice of Hearing was mailed to him at 4255 E. 22nd Street, #457, Tucson, AZ 85710. The respondent states in an affidavit first provided on appeal that the aforementioned address was submitted by him to the Immigration Court on a change of address form. He indicates, however, that he inadvertently provided an incorrect address, and the correct address should have been provided as 4425 E. 22nd Street, #457, Tucson, AZ 85710. The Board appreciates the respondent’s honesty, and it does not dispute that the mistaken submission may have been unintentional. However, the respondent has apparently caused the failure of the Immigration Court to notify him of his hearing at his correct address by having provided an incorrect mailing address. An alien waives his right to receive written notice of a hearing if the alien does not provide a correct mailing address. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(5)(B). We therefore are unable to find that there was a defect in the notice provided to the alien.
 
We will next address whether “exceptional circumstances” caused the respondent’s failure to appear for the hearing. The respondent alleges that his former counsel was negligent in these proceedings, and counsel’s ineffective representation caused the respondent’s absence from the hearing. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances” was untimely and did not meet the procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel. Even if we overlook the untimeliness of the motion and assume that the procedural requirements are now met based on evidence first provided on appeal, we still are unable to reopen these proceedings. The respondent indicates in a letter to the Arizona Bar Association dated June 23, 2009, that his former counsel was his representative until December 13, 2007. He also indicates that former counsel’s representation was derelict prior thereto. However, former counsel did not cause the respondent’s failure to appear on August 14, 2008. Notice of that hearing was sent to the respondent on June 19, 2008, at an address provided by the respondent. His failure to appear may have been avoided had the respondent provided a correct mailing address. We do not find that the respondent proved that his former counsel prevented him from appearing for his hearing. We therefore will not reopen these proceedings based on “exceptional circumstances.”
 
*2 The respondent further argues on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened based on international law. The Board lacks authority to apply international law in deciding whether to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia. See Matter of H-M-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 256 (BIA 1998); Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). We further do not find that an exceptional situation exists herein to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed with the exception of his determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen is number-barred. The numerical limitations only apply to a motion to reopen the instant order of removal. Only one motion to reopen the instant removal order was filed. Motions to reopen prior orders of removal may not be considered in determining whether a number-bar applies in the instant request for reopening.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Walker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has filed a timely motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) to reconsider our decision dated November 12, 2008. In that decision, we denied a motion to reopen.¿FN1º We concluded that the respondent had not established that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance by opting to forego a continuance to wait for the adjudication of an immediate relative petition filed by the respondent’s adult daughter, in favor of going forward with an application for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996). The motion to reopen also argued that the prior counsel was ineffective because she admitted the allegations and conceded removability. Our final decision in this matter was issued on June 18, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of relief in discretion, and also denied a motion to remand filed while the appeal was pending. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
Motions to reconsider must include, in pertinent part, (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision supported by pertinent authority; and (2) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. See Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent, who adjusted to lawful permanent resident status in 1980, had been convicted in 1995 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in violation of Texas State Penal Code section 22.01(a)(2). He departed the United States in January 2006, attempted to reenter as a returning lawful permanent resident alter that year, and was placed in removal proceedings and charged as inadmissible as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act; see Pichardo v. INS, 104 F.3d 756 (5th Cir. 1997); Matter of Medina, 15 I&N Dec. 611 (BIA 1976); Matter of Goodalle, 12 I&N Dec. 106 (BIA 1967). In denying the motion to reopen, we concluded that the prior counsel’s decision to forego a continuance was a strategic decision and the respondent’s subsequent dissatisfaction is not grounds to reopen. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998). Furthermore, the respondent does not dispute the facts.
 
*2 The motion does not identify any legal or factual errors in prior decisions, or arguments overlooked previously. The motion essentially seeks to re-litigate the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which we have already addressed. Also, a motion to reconsider may not be used to make new legal arguments that could have been made previously. Matter of 0-S-G-, supra. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

The motions to reopen filed on July 18, 2008, and September 11, 2008, were considered together as a timely-filed, consolidated motion to reopen. We mistakenly cited to the earlier motion as having been filed on July 16, 2008. This was harmless error.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge De La Mar, Esquire
*1 This case was last before the Board on April 27, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen. The respondent now moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision.
 
In her motion, the respondent contends that she never received a notice of her scheduled court date. She has submitted an affidavit for the first time with her motion, stating that she did not receive notice of her hearing.
 
The Board addressed the issue of notice in our previous decision dated April 27, 2009. We thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record and concluded that the notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s counsel of record at the address he provided on the Form EOIR-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court) and Form EOIR-27 (Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Board of Immigration Appeals). We agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to establish that she lacked notice of her removal hearing. We noted that although counsel stated on appeal that neither he nor the respondent received notice of the respondent’s October 4, 2007, hearing, the respondent failed to submit affidavits or other evidence to establish that she lacked notice of such hearing. As the evidence of record supports the finding that the respondent’s attorney received notice of the hearing, proper notice was provided to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).¿FN1º Consequently, the respondent has failed to present any additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case which was not previously considered by the Board. The respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent’s attorney of record, Mr. De La Mar, Esquire, has never submitted an affidavit stating that he did not receive the notice of hearing. There also is no evidence in the record that the notice of hearing sent to Mr. De La Mar was returned to the Orlando Immigration Court as undeliverable.

File: A098 296 527 - Phoenix, AZ
July 28, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Taihe Wang, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China. He was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 28, 2005, after failing to appear for a hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on April 25, 2008, alleging that he did not receive notice of the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on July 25, 2008, finding that the respondent was adequately notified because the Notice of Hearing was served on the respondent’s former counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent now asserts on appeal that “exceptional circumstances” prevented him from appearing for his hearing. He contends that his former counsel neglected to notify him of the hearing or advise him of his obligation to appear. The respondent argues that these proceedings should be reopened because he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The record contains an affidavit provided by the respondent. Therein, he indicates that he became aware that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia after having hired his present attorney. We note, however, that the respondent’s present attorney also submitted the motion to reopen. No allegation was raised therein of the respondent having been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We further consider that the record contains the affidavit of the respondent’s former counsel’s secretary, Lai Fong Cheong. She states that the respondent contacted her on February 13, 2006, to seek the return of his passport. She further indicates that she informed the respondent that he had been ordered removed from the United States, and he had previously been advised of the consequences of not attending his hearing. Former counsel’s secretary further indicates that she later returned to the respondent his passport and birth certificate. Her account is corroborated by documentation maintained by her reflecting that she had phone conversations with the respondent on February 13, 2006. In addition, the record contains a statement from former counsel wherein he indicates that the respondent was advised of his obligation to appear for his hearing. He further states that the respondent did not provide former counsel with a means of contacting him to notify him of his hearing.
 
The Board has limited authority to render findings of fact when deciding an appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). See also Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). The Board therefore may not determine whether the respondent is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We further do not find it appropriate to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to render a factual finding on whether the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This is in essence a motion to remand. A motion to remand must meet the same requirements as a motion to reopen. A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and must be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The motion will not be granted unless it appears to the Board that the evidence offered in support of the motion is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented previously. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-5 (1988). A party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue previously denied relief bears a heavy burden of proving that if the proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 We find significant that the respondent did not claim that he was a victim of attorney negligence when filing his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. The respondent was then represented by current counsel, and current counsel presumably had explored whether the respondent’s failure to appear for his hearing was caused by an “exceptional circumstance.” That claim was an assertion that should have been raised to the Immigration Judge in the respondent’s motion to reopen, and it should not have first been presented on appeal. We find that the respondent waived his opportunity to argue that an “exceptional circumstance” prevented his appearance from the hearing because it was not first raised in the motion to reopen. We also do not find that the new evidence would likely change the result in the case as respondent’s former counsel has convincingly challenged the respondent’s allegations.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Thompson Guidry
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Nigeria. He was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on April 20, 1999, after failing to appear for a hearing. The respondent filed motions to reopen with the Immigration Judge through former counsel, but they were denied on May 14, 1999, and June 7, 1999. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 16, 2008, denying his third motion to reopen. It was filed by present counsel on December 31, 2007. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that an “exceptional circumstance” prevented him from appearing for his hearing. He asserts that his former counsel failed to properly advise him of his hearing date. He also asserts that his first two motions to reopen were defectively prepared by his former counsel. He further indicates in his affidavit that his former counsel did not inform him that his second motion to reopen was denied on June 7, 1999. The respondent requests that the Board equitably toll the time and number limits on motions to reopen and rescind in absentia removal orders on the basis of claimed exceptional circumstances and reopen these proceedings.
 
A request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date that the order of removal is issued. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Because a request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration even assuming (without deciding) that equitable tolling ever is available; it is not available here. The respondent was aware that he had been ordered removed from the United States in absentia and had a first or second motion to reopen pending before the Immigration Judge. He apparently took little action to ascertain the status of that motion until more than eight years elapsed after it was denied. Even assuming arguendo that the respondent’s former counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, we will not equitably toll the 180-day period for seeking reopening of these proceedings, based on the respondent’s lack of due diligence.
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that an exceptional situation is not present herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We acknowledge the lack of notice issue raised on appeal. However, the argument was not raised before the Immigration Judge. In any event, proper notice to counsel is deemed to be notice provided to an alien. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5. In addition, the motion is untimely to the extent that the respondent seeks reopening to pursue a separate application for adjustment of status under the regular motion to reopen statute and regulations. See also Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Erin Cobb, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mirta J. Woodall
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s April 23, 2009, decision dismissing his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his application for cancellation of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has expressed its opposition to the motion. The motion will be granted, and the record remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent contends that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to consider his eligibility for derivative United States citizenship through his native-born United States citizen mother, and as he did not adequately prepare the respondent’s claim for cancellation of removal. The DHS reports that it has granted the respondent’s request for an administrative stay of removal. It opposes reopening, asserting that the same is “premature” as the respondent’s application for a certificate of citizenship (Form N-600) has not been adjudicated. The DHS essentially avers that unless and until this application is granted, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be proven.
 
The respondent has presented evidence reflecting that he was born in Mexico in 1968. Therefore, he is presumed to be an “alien” within the meaning of section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8U.S.C.§1101 (a)(3), and bears the burden of presenting evidence to demonstrate that he is a United States citizen. Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, 23 I&N Dec. 153, 164 (BIA 2001). The respondent contends that he derived United States citizenship through his mother pursuant to section 309(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1409(c). That provision provides that a child born outside the United States and out of wedlock acquires the “nationality status of the mother, if the mother had the nationality of the United States at the time of ¿the child’sº birth, and if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year.” The respondent has presented evidence showing that his mother is a native-born United States citizen and was unmarried at the time of his birth. She has provided a statement averring that she resided in the United States for the first three or four years of her life, also essentially alleging that she continuously resided in the United States for a period of more than one year prior to the respondent’s birth. As the DHS has reported, the respondent has provided it both with an application for citizenship, and supportive documentation.
 
In light of this evidence, we agree with the respondent that prior counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to consider, much less present before the Immigration Judge, the claim that he has derived United States citizenship from his mother. We observe that the respondent has submitted statements from himself and a sister who hired his former counsel, stating both the complaints with the representation by former counsel, and the representational agreement between counsel and the respondent. A complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and former counsel was provided an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We disagree with the suggestion by the DHS that we cannot find that the respondent was provided with deficient service by former counsel absent a favorable decision on the pending application. Rather, the evidence indicates that the respondent has, at the least, a colorable claim to the requested relief, and counsel clearly failed in presenting the same before the Immigration Court. Accordingly, because it appears that the respondent has complied with the threshold requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra, and since the respondent, as the record now stands, appears prima facie eligible for relief, the motion will be granted. As the DHS indicates, if the respondent’s application for a certificate of citizenship is granted, the instant proceedings will be terminated. Therefore, on remand the Immigration Judge should consider holding proceedings in abeyance pending the adjudication of the respondent’s N-600 application, or other such action as deemed appropriate.¿FN1º
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

In light of our decision, we need not reach the respondent’s arguments regarding former counsel’s handling of his claim for cancellation of removal. However, we note that neither our finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, nor the respondent’s arguments with respect to his cancellation claim, would support termination of the proceedings.

Maureen C. Gaffney
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B))
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 4, 2009 decision ordering him removed from the United States based on his admissions and concession of removability. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
As an initial matter, the summary of the Immigration Judge’s oral decision dated March 4, 2009 indicates that both parties waived appeal, which is also apparent from each counsel’s statements recorded in the transcript of proceedings (Tr. at 7-8). See Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000) (“Asking the parties whether they accept a decision as ‘final’ is a shorthand expression commonly used by Immigration Judges…. Those who understand the meaning of this shorthand expression, such as aliens represented by attorneys or accredited representatives, may effectively waive appeal in response to this simple question.”). Nonetheless, on April 3, 2009, the respondent through different counsel filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). Upon review, we find that the respondent’s former counsel’s stated waiver of appeal was not understood as such by the respondent and was contrary to the respondent’s apparent intention at the time, as indicated by the respondent’s questions on the record immediately following the waiver submitted on his behalf (Tr. at 8) (“Is there anything that can be done to continue fighting this case? … is there any possibility, anything that can be done?”). Thus, under these unusual circumstances in which the respondent immediately stated on the record his desire to “continue fighting this case” in apparent discord with his counsel’s waiver of appeal, and subsequently filed a timely Notice of Appeal, we find it appropriate to review this case by certification (thereby resolving any potential uncertainty regarding our jurisdiction in this matter). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(c), 1003.39. The parties have already been given a fair opportunity to make representations before the Board regarding the case.
 
In his Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), the respondent contends that the evidence presented by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) was insufficient to sustain the sole charge of removability. In addition, the respondent argues that his former counsel failed to object to the evidence presented by DHS. DHS contends that the Immigration Judge reached the correct decision in this matter.
 
*2 Initially, we find that the Immigration Judge properly relied on the respondent’s admission of the allegations in the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) and his concession of removability as charged (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 6-7). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c); see also Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 190-93 (2d Cir. 2009). We also note that the respondent does not allege clear error in the facts alleged and admitted below, and we find none. See 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Moreover, we reject the respondent’s contention that the records of conviction in this case are insufficient to support the sole charge of removability.¿FN1º Although the respondent’s admitted conviction under section 780-113(a)(30) of title 35 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes is not categorically an aggravated felony under the law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, see Evanson v. Attorney General of the United States, 550 F.3d 284 (3d Cir. 2008), it is clear from the respondent’s guilty plea “to the charge preferred” in the criminal information that cocaine was the controlled substance at issue, not marihuana. Thus, even if the respondent’s admission of the allegations and concession of removability were not sufficient to sustain the sole charge, had the records of conviction presented below been admitted into evidence, they would have supplied clear and convincing evidence under the modified categorical approach that the respondent was in fact convicted of an aggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. 841; cf. Evanson, supra, at 292-93.
 
Furthermore, to the extent the respondent contends that his former counsel failed to object to the admission of evidence, we reject the respondent’s implicit argument that his attorney provided ineffective assistance because he has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988), and has failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”); see also Rranci v. Attorney General of the United States, 540 F.3d 165, 172-77 (3d Cir. 2008).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that the conviction records challenged on appeal were not formally admitted into evidence, as the factual allegations and sole removal charge were not contested below (Tr. at 6-7). However, DHS submitted the documents to the Immigration Court “with the intention of offering it into evidence” more than 2 months prior to the respondent’s hearing.

IN RE: PRINCE KENNY AGBAI
File: AXXX XX3 464 - Atlanta, GA
July 7, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a “Motion to Reargue Motion to Reopen,” challenging the Board’s May 19, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen that was previously filed with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
As a motion to reconsider, the motion is timely, but fails to identify any particular error in the Board’s prior decision, and will therefore be denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Rather than assert error, the respondent raises an entirely new claim in the current motion. Specifically, in the prior motion to reopen filed with the Board, he presented additional assertions pertaining to his claim that he did not appear at his scheduled removal hearing because he did not receive notice. The Board had found that the record clearly reflected that his attorney of record was aware of the hearing date when he requested a change of venue, which refuted the respondent’s claim that he had not received the notice of hearing. In the current motion, the respondent now alleges that he was affirmatively advised by his first attorney that he would not need to attend the scheduled hearing because a request for change of venue had been made. Because the respondent no longer appears to challenge the conclusion that he received notice of the hearing, his current motion does not set forth any error of fact or law in our prior decision. Therefore, to the extent the motion requests reconsideration, it will be denied.
 
As pointed out, the motion is more in the nature of a motion to reopen, in that it raises a new claim and presents new evidence to the Board. As such, the motion is time- and number-barred. First, an alien may file only one motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order, regardless of whether the basis for the failure to appear is lack of notice, being in federal or state custody, or exceptional circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In addition, a motion claiming exceptional circumstances for the failure to appear must be filed within 180 days after the date of the Immigration Judge’s final order of removal. Id. The respondent’s current claim is essentially that he was unable to attend his May 12, 2005, hearing due to “exceptional circumstances,” where his attorney specifically told him that he did not need to attend that hearing because counsel had requested a change of venue. He further asserts that it was only after the hearing date had passed that counsel informed him that the motion to change venue had been denied. Thus, this claim must have been raised within 180 days of the May 12, 2005, in absentia order, but the motion raising this claim was not filed until 4 years later on June 1, 2009.
 
*2 With regard to the timeliness issue, we point out that, although some of the United States Courts of Appeals recognize equitable tolling of the time period for the filing of motions to reopen where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has been made, the Eleventh Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the time period for filing motions to reopen is mandatory and jurisdictional. Ali Abdi v. U.S. Attorney General, 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005); Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999). In addition, even if equitable tolling of the time limit could be considered in this case, counsel against whom this allegation has been made has specifically refuted the respondent’s claim. In a March 2009 letter submitted in response to the respondent’s complaint to the local attorney disciplinary committee, counsel states that he orally informed the respondent of the need to attend his scheduled hearing after he learned in April that his request to change venue had not been granted, and that he gave the respondent a letter at that time to present to the Immigration Court when he appeared. Counsel supports his letter with a copy of a letter dated May 10, 2005, addressed to the Immigration Court, explaining his inability to be present with the respondent at the scheduled hearing because of a conflict and renewing the request for a change of venue. His assertions regarding denial of the change of venue request are also supported by the record, where the record reflects that counsel filed two motions to change venue: one that was denied on January 31, 2005, but was mailed to counsel on April 19, 2005; and, a second that was filed on May 3, 2005, and denied on May 11, 2005. The evidence refutes the respondent’s claim that counsel affirmatively told him not to attend the scheduled hearing.
 
To summarize, to the extent the current motion is in the nature of a new motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal based on a claim of exceptional circumstances for the failure to appear, it is number-barred because the respondent already filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order. It is also untimely because it should have been filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s May 12, 2005, in absentia order. Finally, while the Eleventh Circuit does not recognize equitable tolling of time limits on motions to reopen, even if we were to consider the possibility of equitable tolling, we would not find it warranted in this case, where accused counsel has credibly refuted the respondent’s claim that counsel told him not to attend the scheduled hearing. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: LIHUA ZHU, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY CONG NGOC LAI, PETITIONER
File: AXXX XX6 509 - Los Angeles, CA
July 1, 2009
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Luisito L. Lopez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret M. Jambor
Associate Regional Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
*1 The petitioner appeals from the May 7, 2008, decision of the Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship and Immigration Services (“DHS”), denying the petition filed on behalf of the beneficiary the spouse of a United States citizen. The appeal will be dismissed as the petitioner did not meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his marriage to the beneficiary is bona fide.
 
In response to a Notice of Intent to Deny, the petitioner submitted documentary evidence to establish a shared life together with the beneficiary. However, such evidence must be considered in conjunction with the material discrepancies between the statements of the petitioner and the beneficiary at interviews with the DHS and the results of an investigation into the petitioner’s marriage by the DHS. The inconsistencies revealed by the DHS investigation, which are set forth in the February 12, 2008, Notice of Intent to Deny the petition, provided serious reasons for believing that the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary was not bona fide.
 
The petitioner and the beneficiary did not know the names and sex of each other’s siblings, and the beneficiary did not know how much her husband earns, even after 4 years of marriage. Further, an investigation conducted by the DHS showed the petitioner and the beneficiary did not appear to have been together in their home as they claimed, a roommate had not seen the petitioner at the house in a long time, the petitioner and the beneficiary changed their stories about when they left the house, and finally, the beneficiary was evasive when interviewed at work about her arrival there, even being evasive about her time card.
 
In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefits sought. See Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. See Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989).¿FN1º Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that it was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws.¿FN2º See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). However, we note that the failure to produce affirmative evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the marriage is a fraudulent marriage. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B), (D) with 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(ii).
 
*2 In light of the doubts raised about the validity of the marriage, we agree that the weight of the documentary evidence submitted by the petitioner does not overcome the doubts in order to meet his burden of establishing the marriage is bona fide. When the bona fides of a marriage are in question, evidence that might ordinarily be sufficient to meet the petitioner’s burden of proof in this matter, is insufficient in this case because of the substantial evidence in the record that weighs against a finding that the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary is bona fide.
 
On appeal, the petitioner asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceedings is a denial of due process if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). In any case presenting a claim of ineffective assistance, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). Methods of case presentation are within counsel’s professional judgment and are afforded great deference. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 688-89. Strategic decisions, such as whether to call a particular witness at the hearing, rest upon the sound professional judgment of the lawyer. Such appropriately informed strategic decisions are virtually unchallengeable. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 690.
 
The District Director found that statements by counsel made in rebuttal to the NOID were not evidence as there were not personal affidavits. However, even if we accept the statements of counsel as true, we are not persuaded by the explanations for the lack of knowledge by the petitioner and the beneficiary about each other’s lives. Furthermore, counsel’s attempts to create doubt about the discrepancies revealed by the investigation of the DHS are unconvincing as the investigation revealed discrepancies material to the bona fides of the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary. In this regard, the fault for denial of the petition is not with counsel but with the petitioner and the beneficiary as their statements and actions are at the root of the denial. Thus, the petitioner was not prevented from reasonably presenting his case and he has not established ineffective assistance.
 
The petitioner is not precluded from filing a new petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is fully supported by consistent evidence that the petitioner’s marriage to the beneficiary is bona fide. Nevertheless, the petitioner’s motion to remand is denied and the appeal will be dismissed because the petitioner did not meet his burden of proving the bona fides of his marriage to the beneficiary by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

The “clear and convincing” standard applies to a marriage entered into by an alien during removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1154(g), 1255(e); 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii). As the beneficiary was not in removal proceedings when the parties married, that standard is inapplicable here.

2

Evidence to establish the bona fides of a marriage includes proof of joint ownership of property, proof of joint tenancy of a common residence, proof of commingling of financial resources, birth certificates of children born of the petitioner and the beneficiary, and affidavits of others having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas J. Tarigo, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º -Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated September 14, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for lack of jurisdiction. The respondent has appealed from that decision, and has also re-filed his motion to reopen with this Board. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was granted the privilege of voluntary departure by an Immigration Judge in July 1993, but he failed to depart by the court-imposed deadline, resulting in the automatic entry of an order of deportation against him. In February 2004. approximately 10 years after his deportation order became final, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge in which he requested an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely in a decision dated March 23, 2004, and this Board affirmed that decision in an order entered on June 16, 2004. On July 18, 2007, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, in which he argued that his due process right to a full and fair deportation hearing had been deprived by the ineffective assistance of two attorneys, the one who represented him in his initial deportation proceedings, and also the one who filed his first motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge denied this second motion for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that authority to adjudicate the motion rested with the Board, which had issued the last substantive order in the matter.
 
The respondent has filed an appeal, but the appeal will be dismissed because it does not challenge any aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision below. We note in this regard that the Immigration Judge expressed no opinion as to the merits of the respondent’s motion; instead, he simply found that he lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate it. Indeed, it appears that the respondent simply filed an appeal as a means of placing his motion to reopen before this Board. We agree with the Immigration Judge that this Board is the proper forum for consideration of the respondent’s motion, which has been re-filed with us by the respondent. Accordingly, we now turn to the merits of the motion to reopen.
 
As a threshold matter, the respondent’s motion to reopen is both number-barred and untimely. The regulation applicable to the respondent provides that he may file only one motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, and that he must file any such motion by not later than September 30, 1996. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2007). As noted previously, the respondent already filed a motion to reopen in February 2004. Furthermore, the respondent’s final administrative order of deportation was rendered in July 1993, and therefore his motion to reopen was subject to the September 30, 1996, deadline. Yet the respondent did not file his second motion to reopen until 2007, more than 10 years late. Finally, the motion does not qualify for any regulatory exception to these time and number limits. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 Although the respondent’s motion is both time- and numbered-barred, this Board possesses limited discretionary authority to reopen deportation proceedings sua sponte in exceptional circumstances. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction these proceedings arise, has held that the regulatory limitations on motions may be “tolled” for equitable reasons. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent’s motion claims that his due process rights were violated by the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, a serious allegation. Under the circumstances, however, we find no valid basis for either sua sponte reopening or equitable tolling.
 
First, although the respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from an attorney who had been retained to represent him in connection with his 1993 deportation hearings, there is no indication that any attorney ever entered an appearance before the Immigration Court or otherwise qualified as the respondent’s attorney of record in those proceedings. And indeed, the respondent’s bar complaint form (which is attached as Exhibit G to his motion), specifies that the attorney was employed by him in 2002 and 2003, nearly 10 years after the respondent’s deportation proceedings were concluded. In light of these discrepancies, we conclude that it would be inappropriate to grant the respondent extraordinary equitable relief.
 
In any event, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s motion contains no such affidavit, and therefore we have no means of determining whether the actions and omissions complained of were even within the scope of prior counsel’s representation. In this regard, we observe that statements of counsel, set forth in the motion, are not evidence. INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Furthermore, there is no evidence that the respondent’s prior attorneys have been informed of the allegations leveled against them and given an opportunity to respond. Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556. Thus, we have no means of determining whether the actions and omissions complained of were “strategic” in nature, or otherwise justified by circumstances existing at the time they allegedly occurred. Accordingly, the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not properly substantiated, and would be insufficient to justify reopening even under normal circumstances.
 
*3 Finally, although the respondent claims that his first attorney was ineffective by failing to file an application for Family Unity benefits on his behalf, it is evident from the respondent’s own submissions (see Exhibit B to the motion) that he has been aware of the availability of such relief since early 1995. The respondent has offered no explanation as to why he waited until 2007 to raise this issue with the Board, although he does suggest that his second attorney should have raised the matter in connection with his 2004 motion. But even if the issue had been raised in 2004, an alien does not exercise due diligence—as required to merit sua sponte reopening or equitable tolling—by waiting 9 years to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding equitable tolling of motions deadline unavailable where alien failed to exercise due diligence in raising ineffective assistance of counsel claim against prior attorney).
 
In conclusion, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed because it does not articulate any challenge to the Immigration Judge’s decision, which merely denied his motion to reopen for lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied because it is time-and number-barred.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer Gaz
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the January 14, 2009, decision of the Immigration Judge which found that the respondent had abandoned his claim for relief due to his failure to file any application for relief by the date ordered. In his decision, the Immigration Judge also vacated a merits hearing that he had scheduled for September 16, 2009. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Our review of the record reveals that, on May 15, 2008, the Immigration Judge granted a continuance requested by the respondent’s then counsel, who was seeking additional preparation time (Tr. at 3). The parties were instructed to return to court on July 10, 2008. On that date, counsel for respondent conceded proper service, admitted all allegations contained in the Notice to Appear except the date of entry, and requested an additional 180 days to file an application for cancellation of removal, based on alleged hardship to a United States citizen son of the respondent. See Tr. at 5-7. The Immigration Judge granted the counsel’s request, ordering the parties to return to court on September 16, 2009, and instructing the respondent to file his application by January 6, 2009. See Tr. at 7. The Immigration Judge specifically warned the respondent, on the record, that a failure to file his application for relief by the stated date “may constitute abandonment of the application for relief without hearing.” Id.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that, since the respondent failed to file his application for relief from removal by the ordered date of January 6, 2009, he is considered to have abandoned his claim. See I.J. at 1-2; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). As shown in our earlier discussion, proceedings in this matter had already been delayed to allow the respondent ample time to prepare for his merits hearing, and the respondent had been specifically warned of the potential consequences of a failure to submit his application for relief by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge. Moreover, on appeal, the respondent does not dispute that he failed to timely file his application for cancellation of removal, which the record shows was filed over a week after the established deadline, specifically on the date of the Immigration Judge’s decision. Rather, the respondent alleges that his prior counsel (who represented him before the Immigration Judge) was responsible for the untimely filing, as that counsel “did not advise me that ¿the application for reliefº was required to be filed by a certain date and in fact did not inform me of anything regarding the status or progress of my case.” See Respondent’s NOA, Box 6. The respondent also generally alleges on appeal that this attorney defrauded him and provided him with “inaccurate and plainly false advice on ¿hisº case.” Id. The respondent’s allegations of fraud and inaccurate and false advice are no more than cursory, unsubstantiated allegations. Also, the allegations regarding lack of advice are not only likewise cursory, but do not demonstrate any prejudice to the respondent inasmuch as the specific advice that the respondent claims he did not receive from his attorney was specifically provided to him by the Immigration Judge at the hearing. See Tr. at 7. Moreover, we note that the respondent has not shown that he has substantially complied with the threshold requirements to appropriately pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)¿FN1º. As such, we do not find that a remand is warranted for consideration of any claim pertaining to purported ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, we further note that, while an application for cancellation of removal has now been filed in this case, that application shows no prima facie eligibility for this particular form of relief inasmuch as it identifies no qualifying relatives.¿FN2º Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed. Reg. 76,927, 937-38 (Dec. 18, 2008) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1)).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252. the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 73 Fed. Reg. at 76,938 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i)).

In the section of the cancellation of removal application that is provided to identify the qualifying relatives to which an alien alleges that his or her removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship, the respondent checked the box for United States citizen children. See Respondent’s Form EOIR-42B, at 1, Box 17. However, in the section provided to identify his children, he indicated that he had none. See Respondent’s Form EOIR-42B, at 4, Box 45. In the form, the respondent also claimed not to be married (Respondent’s Form EOIR-42B, at 2, Box 25) and did not allege that either of his parents was a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident (Respondent’s Form EOIR-42B, at 4, Box 48).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lauren L. Baker, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Peter J. Pratt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) appeals from an Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2009, decision terminating proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge terminated proceedings¿FN1º on the basis of the vacatur of the respondent’s December 6, 2005, conviction for distribution of cocaine in violation of section 32A(a) of chapter 94C of the Massachusetts General Laws. The respondent argued below that this vacatur was based on his July 2008 motion to vacate plea and for a new trial, in which he argued that he did not receive effective assistance from his criminal defense counsel, in that he was not aware of, and did not understand, his constitutional rights prior to his admission of sufficient facts to support a conviction. See Motion to Terminate at Tab E. The respondent’s motion to vacate his plea was granted by order of the trial judge on August 5, 2008, by way of a written notation on the face of the motion which states that it was granted “based on ineffective assist of counsel.” Id. The respondent argued below that this document reflects evidence that his underlying conviction was vacated based on a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings rather than upon a rehabilitative statute or immigration hardship. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). The Immigration Judge agreed, and terminated proceeding (I.J. at 2).
 
On appeal, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge’s written notation, as set forth above, that he was vacating the conviction and ordering a new trial based on “insufficient assist of counsel” does not provide a statement of the “reasons for allowing the motion for a new trial.” See DHS’s Brief at 4.
 
We disagree. The test for deciding whether a conviction has been vacated for immigration purposes as set forth in Matter of Pickering, supra, is whether the conviction has been vacated on the merits. Id. A conviction vacated due to ineffective assistance of counsel qualifies as a vacation on the merits. See id.; see also Rumierz v. Gonzales, 456 F.3d 31, 40 n. 13 (1st Cir. 2006) (endorsing the idea that ineffective assistance of counsel was a “clear defect in the underlying criminal proceedings”). Therefore, it appears from the record that the respondent has established that his 2005 conviction has been vacated and is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. Cf. Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006). We specifically note that the record does not contain any Immigration Judge finding of fact that would indicate that the respondent’s arguments regarding the sufficiency of legal representation were solely related to his understanding of the “immigration consequences” of his plea (DHS’s Brief at 7). Rather, the trial judge’s decision to grant the motion to vacate the guilty plea and order a new trial is written on the face of the respondent’s actual motion, on which the respondent states that he did not “fully understand his constitutional rights” due to the ineffective assistance of counsel (Motion to Terminate, Tab E). While the respondent’s later-acquired knowledge of the immigration consequences of his plea may well have triggered his 2008 motion to vacate his guilty plea, there are no factual findings in the record to support the DHS’s argument.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kari Hong, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Austin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on April 24, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen proceedings in which she had been ordered deported in absentia on September 6, 1995. On January 8, 2009, the respondent submitted an untimely motion to reopen proceedings, which the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes.¿FN1º 8C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion and the respondent’s request for a stay will be denied.
 
In her current motion the respondent avers that former counsel, Ms. Rossiter, provided her with deficient legal assistance in representing her in her initial motion before the Immigration Judge, and the ensuing appeal to the Board. We note that the decision of the United States Attorney General in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710, 716-727 (A.G. 2009) finding that aliens have no constitutional right to effective assistance from counsel has recently been vacated. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). Therefore, we shall review the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the standards enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (hereinafter, Lozada).
 
The respondent essentially requests equitable tolling of the motion’s deadline based on her claim of ineffective assistance by former counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that the court recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when an alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and upheld in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We conclude that equitable tolling is not warranted.
 
In Lozada the Board outlined several procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 639. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has held that these requirements “are not sacrosanct,” particularly when a record reveals “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000). Rather, the Ninth Circuit has held that, “Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). As such, to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that she was prejudiced by an attorney’s deficient performance. Iturribarria v. INS, supra at 903 (finding that an attorney’s “flawed” performance did not provide a basis for a due process claim because the alien could not “demonstrate that counsel’s alleged malfeasance prejudiced his claim for relief”). However, where an attorney’s performance was inadequate but an alien still had an opportunity to present her claim, “¿pºrejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
*2 Here, the respondent contends that former counsel erred by failing to submit a motion to reopen supplemented by adequate evidentiary support, which delineated all legal theories relevant to her claim for relief, and was supported by an explanation of how she acted diligently in pursuing her claim (Motion at 1-22; Suppl. Motion at 1-3; Response to DHS Opposition at 1-2 (hereinafter, “Response”)). The respondent argues that Ms. Rossiter failed to raise four legal arguments in the motion which would “more likely than not” have changed the outcome in the Board’s review of her appeal (Response at 3). Specifically, she alleges that Ms. Rossiter erred by not arguing that the respondent’s father’s failure to notify her of his receipt of her hearing notice and his allegedly false notification to the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) that she had departed the United States for Guatemala following her detention by INS constituted exceptional circumstances excusing her failure to appear at her hearing; as the respondent was a minor she received inadequate notice pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 242.24; because of her father’s actions the notice of hearing was not served on a “responsible person” as required; she did not receive notice pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, and, the Board should have vacated proceedings pursuant to Matter of M-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 125 (BIA 1998) (Response at 1-2).
 
However, by the respondent’s own admission she was not a minor at the time that she was served with the Order to Show Cause on December 1, 1994 (Motion at 140; Exh. 1).¿FN2º Rather, she has repeatedly reported that she was born on October 31, 1973, which means that she was 21-years of age when the charging document was served upon her. Therefore, any protections then relevant to a minor were not applicable to the respondent. As such, it is unclear why current counsel repeatedly raises arguments that pertain solely to minors detained by immigration authorities, and we shall not address these arguments further. We observe that former counsel’s failure to raise these irrelevant arguments does not constitute error, much less represent a prejudicial failing on her part.
 
As this Board has previously noted, the respondent was personally served with the Order to Show Cause which was read to her in her native Spanish language, and which contained warnings regarding her obligation to inform the Immigration Court of any change of address and the consequences attending a failure to appear for her deportation hearing (Exh. 1). When she was released from detention her father’s address was provided as the location where she could receive mail from the Immigration Court. By her own admission the respondent affirmatively elected not to inform the Immigration Court when she left her father’s residence for another state, as she chose to rely upon him to forward her mail to her new residence (Motion at 140). Thus, as the respondent failed to provide an address pursuant to section 242B(a)(1)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(a)(1)(F), then “no written notice shall be required.” Section 242(c)(2) of the Act; see also Matter of Villalba, 21 I&N Dec. 842 (BIA 1997). Therefore, former counsel did not err in failing to raise arguments regarding; whether the respondent’s father was a “responsible person” or his alleged actions constituted exceptional circumstances since the respondent’s failure to inform the Immigration Court of her correct address is dispositive.¿FN3º See also Chaidez v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d 773 (9th Cir. 2007) (examining whether a “responsible person” had signed for a notice of hearing sent by certified mail where the respondent still resided at the address to which it had been sent). Moreover, a claim alleging she failed to appear due to “exceptional circumstances” (i.e., her father’s failure to inform her of her hearing date) would have been untimely. See Section 242B(c)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3) (a motion to reopen claiming exceptional circumstances prevented a respondent from appearing at his hearing must be filed within 180 days of the date of the order of deportation).
 
*3 We observe that as the Board did not predicate our dismissal of the respondent’s appeal on her failure to demonstrate due diligence, and as she has not shown that any failings by Ms. Rossiter were prejudicial, her arguments in this regard are unavailing. The respondent’s reliance on Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA1998) is misplaced as, unlike the alien in that case, she did receive oral warnings in her native language of the consequences of failing to appear at her deportation hearing (Motion a: 16). Moreover, even if Matter of M-S- was applicable, which it is not, the respondent’s motion was untimely filed, and reopening on that basis would not be appropriate. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b). Finally, we do not find that the facts presented in this case represent exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that the Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); see also Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Thus, while we are not unsympathetic to the respondent’s situation, we find that she has failed to demonstrate that Ms. Rossiter’s provided her with deficient performance, much less that any actions on her part were prejudicial such that reopening is warranted. Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
In light of our decision, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal is rendered moot. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent supplemented her motion with a January 30, 2009, submission intended to comply with the requirements enumerated in See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (hereinafter, “Matter of Compean”). In addition, she has submitted a reply to the DHS’ opposition to her motion, as well as a “sur-reply” regarding her motion.

We observe that the respondent and her husband have reported that her date of birth is October 31, 1973 (Absentia Motion, tab B (Resps. Affid), H (marriage certificate), J & K (applications for Special Rule Cancellation).

Moreover, the “failure in the internal workings” of a household to provide delivered mail to the addressee does not render the notice defective. See Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540, 547 (BIA 2002); see also Farhoud v. INS, 122 F.3d 794, 796 (9th Cir. 1997) (no exceptional circumstances where petitioner did not actually and personally receive a notice of hearing). In this regard, we observe that the record contains evidence that the notice of the respondent’s September 6, 1995, hearing was sent to her father’s address, and includes the return receipt card which was signed by her father, reflecting that the same was properly delivered to that address. Also, in our prior decision we recognized that any claim of “exceptional circumstances” was untimely filed. Thus, former counsel did did not err with respect to raising such a claim.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ping C. Shen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Warren R. Kaufman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the October 17, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings held in absentia on March 19, 2007. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In her motion, the respondent asserts ineffective assistance of counsel, claiming that the attorney she retained to assist her at the original hearing neglected to advise her to attend the hearing even though the respondent requested a change of venue. The respondent asserts that such situation warrants reopening as she was not advised to attend the hearing.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(h) and (iii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The factual findings of the Immigration Judge are not clearly erroneous, and we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s thorough and well-reasoned decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994); see generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We considered the respondent’s contentions on appeal but we concur in the Immigration Judge’s determinations concerning the respondent’s request for reopening. In particular, the Immigration Judge noted the evidentiary deficiencies in the respondent’s case, primarily the lack of a certified Chinese translation (I.J. at 5). The Immigration Judge also correctly noted that the attorney of record at the time of the hearing was not the attorney whom the respondent now claims ineffectively assisted her (I.J. at 6). The attorney of record notified the respondent and he himself appeared at the hearing. The respondent fails to present an explanation for this situation. Finally the respondent has not presented evidence of ineffective assistance by counsel and indeed has neglected to state any shortcomings by the attorney of record. On the basis she has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guyana, has filed a motion to reconsider our prior decision. This case was previously before the Board on July 28, 2008, when we remanded the matter to the Immigration Judge. In that decision, we concluded that the Immigration Judge erred in terminating proceedings, and sustained the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) appeal, determining that the record established that the loss to the victim of the fraud offense for which the respondent was convicted was in excess of $10,000. Section 101(a)(43)(M) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). On remand, in an October 28, 2008, decision, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.¿FN1º In our March 12, 2009, decision, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. A motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must include, in pertinent part, (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority; and (2) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The instant motion essentially disagrees with our conclusion that the record contains clear and convincing evidence that the loss to the victim, Fleet Bank, exceeded $ 10,000. The motion essentially repeats the facts and arguments in the prior motion, but does not demonstrate that reconsideration is warranted. The motion does not establish any errors or law or fact in our prior decision that would warrant reconsideration. 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

Previously, on March 6, 2008, we had sustained the respondent’s appeal of the earlier November 6, 2007, Immigration Judge decision finding the respondent subject to removal as an aggravated felon. We concluded there had been ineffective assistance of counsel that warranted further proceedings to determine whether or not the loss to the victim of the bank fraud exceeded $10,000.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from a decision dated January 8, 2008, by the Immigration Judge in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent argues that she was misinformed by her former counsel with respect to having to appear at her October 26, 2006, hearing and as such, she was ordered removed in absentia as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order, pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). However, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy certain criteria as set forth in Matter of Compean, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (establishing an administrative framework superceding, but drawing upon, the approach set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 639 (BIA 1988)). Although the new document filing requirements established in Matter of Compean, supra, do not apply here because the respondent’s motion was filed prior to the issuance of Matter of Compean, supra, the substantive standards set forth in that decision must be met by the respondent. See Matter of Compean, supra, at 741-742 (holding that the new document filing requirements set forth in this decision only apply to motions filed after the issuance date of this decision (January 7, 2009); for motions filed prior to this decision, the Lozada factors continue to apply). Matter of Lozada requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
*2 Here, we conclude as did the Immigration Judge on January 8, 2008, that the respondent did not comply with the Lozada requirements. Although the respondent has alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and submitted a photocopy of a complaint she claims to have filed with North Carolina State Bar, she has failed to otherwise comply with the above requirements. In this regard, she has failed to submit an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, there is no indication that her former counsel was notified of the allegations or that he was allowed an opportunity to respond. In reaching this conclusion, we find no merit to the respondent’s appellate contention that the Immigration Judge did not adequately consider her claims.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ORDER:
 
*1 This case is before the Board pursuant to the February 20, 2009, order issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granting the government’s unopposed motion to remand for further consideration of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim in light of orders of the Supreme Court of Arizona, issued after the Board’s April 18, 2008, decision, which address the competence of her prior attorney, Ronald G. Finch, as an immigration attorney.¿FN1º Inexplicably, neither party has provided the orders of the Supreme Court of Arizona to the Board that we have been asked to consider. However, the Department of Homeland Security has summarized the orders in its opposition brief and reports that, on May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court of Arizona has issued a final Judgment and Order censuring Mr. Finch. See DHS Brief at 9. Upon reconsideration of the totality of the circumstances presented here, we now find that the proceedings should be reopened to allow the respondent an opportunity to file an application for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, on reconsideration, the respondent’s motion is granted, the Board’s prior decisions in the case are vacated, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the court’s order.

On January 7, 2009, Attorney General Mukasey overruled in part the decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“Board”) in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and affirmed the Board’s orders denying reopening in Matter of Compean, A078 566 977 (BIA May 20, 2008), Matter of Bangaly, A078 555 848 (BIA Mar. 7, 2008), and Matter of J-E-C- (BIA Apr. 8, 2008). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (“Compean”). In Lozada, the Board established the procedural requirements for filing a motion to reopen deportation (now removal) proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and required the alien to show *2 that he was prejudiced by the action or inaction of his counsel. Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639-40. The Compean decision acknowledged that the Lozada framework had “largely stood the test of time,” having been expressly reaffirmed by the Board 15 years after its initial adoption. Compean, 24 I&N Dec. at 731; see also Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 556-57 (affirming the application of Lozada to removal proceedings). Nonetheless, Compean both rejected Lozada’s constitutional reasoning and ordered the Board not to rely upon the Lozada framework, even as a discretionary matter. Instead, Compean set forth, as an exercise of the Attorney General’s administrative discretion, a new substantive and procedural framework for reviewing all such claims and a formulation of the prejudice showing different from that followed by many courts, despite the limited discussion of the Lozada framework in the briefs submitted in Compean by the parties and amici curiae. Compean further provided that this new administrative framework should apply “henceforth,” even though the decision acknowledged it might conflict with the Lozada-based approach taken by a number of Federal Courts of Appeals. See Compean, 24 I&N Dec. at 730 & n.8.
 
**2 For the reasons stated herein, I have determined that it is appropriate to reconsider the January 7, 2009 decision.
 
Establishing an appropriate framework for reviewing motions to reopen immigration proceedings based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is a matter of great importance. I do not believe that the process used in Compean resulted in a thorough consideration of the issues involved, particularly for a decision that implemented a new, complex framework in place of a well-established and longstanding practice that had been reaffirmed by the Board in 2003 after careful consideration. The preferable administrative process for reforming the Lozada framework is one that affords all interested parties a full and fair opportunity to participate and ensures that the relevant facts and analysis are collected and evaluated.
 
Accordingly, I direct the Acting Director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review to initiate rulemaking procedures as soon as practicable to evaluate the Lozada framework and to determine what modifications should be proposed for public consideration. After soliciting information and public comment, through publication of a proposed rule in the Federal Register, from all interested persons on a revised framework for reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings, the Department of Justice may, if appropriate, proceed with the publication of a final rule.
 
*3 In Compean, the introduction of a new procedural framework depended in part on Attorney General Mukasey’s conclusion that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. Because that conclusion is not necessary either to decide these cases under pre-Compean standards or to initiate a rulemaking process, this Order vacates Compean in its entirety. To ensure that there is an established framework in place pending the issuance of a final rule, the Board and Immigration Judges should apply the pre-Compean standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of when such motions were filed. The litigating positions of the Department of Justice will remain unaffected by this Order. Finally, prior to Compean, the Board itself had not resolved whether its discretion to reopen removal proceedings includes the power to consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on conduct of counsel that occurred after a final order of removal had been entered. Given the absence of a pre-Compean standard of the Board to apply pending issuance of a final rule, I resolve the question in the interim by concluding that the Board does have this discretion, and I leave it to the Board to determine the scope of such discretion.
 
**3 Turning to the merits of the particular cases at issue, I find that, for the reasons stated by the Board, its orders denying reopening of the three matters reviewed in Compean were appropriate under the Lozada framework and standards as established by the Board before Compean. On that basis, I concur with Attorney General Mukasey’s decision to affirm the Board’s decisions denying reopening of these matters. Compean, 24 I&N Dec. at 743.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dmitry Paniotto, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; adjustment of status
 
In a decision dated February 25, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen her deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under former section 242B(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c). The respondent has filed a timely appeal from that decision. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent entered the United States without inspection on or about October 25, 1994, at or near Champlain, New York. The respondent subsequently was placed into deportation proceedings. On April 27, 1995, the respondent submitted a change of address form to the immigration court, indicating that her address had changed from Fort Lee, New Jersey to Los Angeles, California (Exh. 4). On May 03, 1995, the respondent was sent a hearing notice, via certified mail at her most recent address, informing her of her upcoming deportation hearing at the Newark, New Jersey immigration court on June 20, 1995 (Exh. 5). The return receipt shows the respondent’s signature (Exh. 5). On May 04, 1995, the Immigration Judge issued a decision denying the respondent’s motion to change venue from Newark to Los Angeles, sent to the respondent’s most recent address (Exh. 7A). This decision again informed the respondent of her upcoming hearing in Newark, New Jersey on June 20, 1995 (Exh. 7A). A person purporting to be the respondent’s attorney then submitted a second motion to change venue, received by the immigration court on June 09, 1995 (Exh. 6). The Immigration Judge also denied this motion in an order dated June 13, 1995 (Exh. 7). In her order, the Immigration Judge observed that the person purporting to be the respondent’s attorney had not filed a form EOIR-28 with the immigration court, such that she was not considered to be the respondent’s attorney of record. Nevertheless, the Immigration Judge sent a copy of the denial of the motion both to the respondent at her most recent address of record and to the person purporting to be her attorney “as a courtesy only” (Exh. 7). This order again reminded the respondent for a third time of her obligation to appear for her hearing scheduled on June 20, 1995 (Exh. 7).
 
The respondent failed to appear at her scheduled deportation hearing on June 20, 1995, and was ordered deported in absentia in an order signed on June 23, 1995 (I.J. Dec. dated 6/23/95).
 
Some 13 years later, on February 01, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order in order to adjust status based on an approved I-130 visa petition filed by her lawful permanent resident husband. At that time, the respondent argued that she never received notice of the June 20, 1995, deportation hearing, claiming that her former counsel failed to submit a change of address form for the respondent.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion in a decision dated February 25, 2008.
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to make a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in this case. To the extent that the respondent is asserting that her failure to appear for his deportation hearing was due to exceptional circumstances based on the ineffective assistance of her former counsel, such a claim is precluded as untimely. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A), on the basis of exceptional circumstances). We recognize that the Third Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has indicated that an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel might provide a basis for equitably tolling the relevant filing deadlines where the respondent has exercised due diligence in discovering the ineffective assistance of counsel and filing the motion to reopen. Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2005). However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s failure to file her motion for some 13 years after the in absentia order was entered shows a lack of the requisite due diligence (I.J. at 3).
 
Moreover, we need not address the merits of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because we agree with the Immigration Judge that proper notice of the June 20, 1995, hearing was provided to the respondent, such that there is no evidence of any ineffective assistance of counsel. The record reflects that a copy of the respondent’s hearing notice was mailed to the respondent via certified mail, return receipt requested, at her correct address (Exhs. 5, 7, 7A). See section 242B(c)(l) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(1)). Such notice is sufficient to establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien received written notice of the deportation hearing within the meaning of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Moreover, while the respondent argues that her prior counsel failed to file a change of address form for the respondent, the record is clear that this form was properly filed (Exh. 4), and that subsequent correspondence from the immigration court, including the respondent’s hearing notice (Exh. 5) and both denials of the motions to change venue (Exhs. 7, 7A), were sent to the respondent at this new address. Accordingly, we do not find that the respondent was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 To the extent that she seeks sua sponte reopening, we find no basis to reverse the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances that would warrant the exercise of the limited discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002); Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

While the respondent’s motion to reopen is not entirely clear, it appears that the respondent is claiming that she was first represented by a notary public, then by an attorney at the time of her prior proceedings, neither of whom submitted a change of address form. We will assume, without deciding, that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can lie against a non-attorney in the Third Circuit, such that our analysis applies to both persons. See Gunawan v. Gonzales, 132 Fed.Appx. 997, 1000 n.4 (9th Cir. 2005) (unpublished decision) (indicating skepticism that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could lie against “a non-attorney who never purported to be an attorney”).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Acosta, Jr., Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º -Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility; continuance
 
In a decision dated June 3, 2005, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States as an arriving alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (“CIMT”). Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (2000). The respondent filed a timely appeal to this Board in which he argued that he had been deprived of his due process right to a full and fair hearing because of the ineffective assistance of his former attorney. On September 11, 2006, we issued a decision dismissing the appeal based on our determination that the respondent had failed to demonstrate prejudice arising from his prior counsel’s allegedly deficient performance. The respondent thereafter filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has now remanded the matter to us for consideration of two intervening precedents, Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 872 (9th Cir. 2007), and Matter of Abosi, 24 I&N Dec. 204 (BIA 2007). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that neither of the aforementioned decisions is applicable to the respondent’s case, and therefore we will once again dismiss his appeal.
 
Section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), provides that a lawful permanent resident (“LPR”) of the United States is to be treated as an applicant for admission (or “arriving alien”) if he or she “has committed an offense identified in section 212(a)(2), unless since such offense the alien has been granted relief under section 212(h) or 240A(a).” This provision, which became effective on April 1, 1997, abrogated the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449 (1963), which held that LPRs who had been convicted of crimes in the United States could make “innocent, casual, and brief overseas trips without being classified as seeking “entry” upon return and thus being exposed to a charge of inadmissibility. In Camins v. Gonzales, supra, the Ninth Circuit held that section 101 (a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act could not be applied retroactively to LPRs who pled guilty to their crimes when the Fleuti doctrine was still in effect, because such aliens would have had a reasonable reliance-based expectation that they would continue to be able to make “innocent, casual, and brief departures from the United States without being subjected to the legal disadvantages associated with treatment as an arriving alien.
 
*2 On remand, we are called upon to determine whether Camins v. Gonzales, supra, is applicable to the respondent’s circumstances. We conclude that it is not. The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without being admitted or paroled in 1989. In December 1990 he was convicted of engaging in disorderly conduct by means of a lewd act in violation of section 647(a) of the California Penal Code. More than a decade later, on June 1, 2001, the respondent’s status was adjusted to that of an LPR, but on February 28, 2002, he sustained another criminal conviction, this time for petty theft in violation of section 484(a) of the California Penal Code. The respondent thereafter departed the United States and traveled abroad. On September 17, 2003, he arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport port of entry and presented himself for inspection as a returning LPR. Upon discovering the respondent’s convictions, however, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) initiated these removal proceedings, charging the respondent with inadmissibility as an arriving alien convicted of a CIMT.
 
As the foregoing facts make clear, the respondent can be treated as an arriving alien despite his LPR status because he departed the United States after committing petty theft, “an offense identified in section 212(a)(2)” for which no waiver was ever granted. Section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act. In Camins v. Gonzales, supra, the alien’s only “offense identified in section 212(a)(2)” was committed (and resulted in a plea and conviction) in January 1996, more than one year prior to the April 1, 1997, effective date of section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act. In contrast, the respondent was convicted of a CIMT in February 2002, nearly five years after section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) became effective. Thus, under the law in effect when the respondent entered his plea to petty theft in February 2002, he had no reasonable, reliance-based expectation that the Fleuti doctrine would be applied to him in the event he chose to travel abroad in the future.
 
We recognize that the offense underlying the respondent’s February 2002 conviction would have been a “petty offense” under section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act but for the fact that he was also convicted in 1990 of engaging in disorderly conduct by means of a lewd act, a CIMT in its own right. Yet Camins v. Gonzales, supra, is simply inapposite with respect to that earlier conviction, which was entered more than ten years before the respondent became an LPR. Indeed, when the respondent sustained his disorderly conduct conviction he had no lawful immigration status at all, and thus he could not at that time have had a reasonable, reliance-based expectation that the Fleuti doctrine would apply to him. Furthermore, even if the respondent had been an LPR when he pled guilty to disorderly conduct in 1990, by the time of his 2002 plea to petty theft he would have been on notice that the earlier crime could be used against him in the future to preclude application of the petty offense exception. Thus, we conclude that Camins v. Gonzales, supra, is inapplicable, and that the respondent is properly classified as an arriving alien despite his LPR status.
 
*3 Having determined that Camins v. Gonzales, supra, is inapposite, we must now decide whether the respondent’s case is affected by Matter of Abosi, supra, in which the Board held that a returning LPR who was charged with inadmissibility as an arriving alien could apply for a “direct” waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, and did not need to seek such a waiver in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status. While the respondent’s returning LPR status does place him in the class of aliens who can apply for the direct form of section 212(h) relief, Matter of Abosi, supra, is inapplicable because the respondent’s ineligibility for section 212(h) relief arises from independent grounds.
 
Section 212(h) provides that “¿nºo waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the United States as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if … the alien has not lawfully resided continuously in the United States for a period of not less than 7 years immediately preceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the United States.” In other words, section 212(h) relief is—as an LPR or otherwise—throughout the 7-year period immediately preceding the institution of proceedings. Matter of Rotimi, 24 I&N Dec. 567 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent’s removal proceedings were initiated on November 21, 2003, when the Notice to Appear was filed in Immigration Court. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.1(a) (2003). Thus, the respondent must come forward with evidence to establish that he “lawfully resided” in the United States for a continuous period beginning not later than November 21, 1996. No such evidence has been proffered. On the contrary, the only evidence of lawful residence provided by the respondent pertains to his adjustment to LPR status in June 2001, a mere 2 1/2 years before these proceedings were initiated. Accordingly, based on the record as currently constituted, there is no evidence that the respondent qualifies for section 212(h) relief, whether or not he seeks it in conjunction with adjustment of status. Matter of Abosi is therefore inapposite, and provides no basis for further proceedings.
 
In conclusion, neither Camins v. Gonzales, supra, nor Matter of Abosi, supra, has any discernible effect on the respondent’s removability or eligibility for relief from removal. Moreover, no issue has been raised as to the propriety of our earlier decision in this matter, which pertained solely to ineffective assistance of counsel, the only issue raised in the respondent’s appeal. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
*4 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security’s request that we consider its late response to the motion is denied. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. In our last decision, we noted that, “to the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance of his former counsel, he has failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).” At the time the instant motion was filed, the respondent was aware that the Attorney General was expected to issue a decision regarding the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The respondent’s motion was filed in the hope that the Attorney General would issue a decision with less stringent guidelines than those established in Matter of Lozada. However, in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General ruled that the procedural requirements established in Matter of Lozada would continue to apply to ineffective assistance claims, such as the respondent’s, made prior to January 7, 2009, and set forth more stringent requirements for deficient performance of counsel claims made thereafter. The Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C- therefore does not effect our rejection of his ineffective assistance claim for failure to comply with the Lozada requirements. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Ghana. On March 15, 2007, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied. The respondent filed a timely Notice of Appeal. On December 11, 2007, the Board dismissed the appeal. On November 26, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. She contends that former counsel told her not to appear for her hearing because he was seeking a change of venue, and that such advise was ineffective because the motion was not granted and she was ordered removed in absentia through no fault of her own. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996).
 
On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision announcing a new standard for claims involving what was formerly known as) ineffective assistance of counsel. In Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General announced several new substantive standards for evaluating such claims, now known as “deficient performance of counsel” claims, that apply regardless of whenever a motion to reopen that raises such claims has been filed, as well as new evidentiary standards that are not implicated here because they only apply to a motion to reopen filed after January 7, 2009. See 24 I&N Dec. at 741. Consistent with that decision, the respondent’s claims are designated “deficient performance of counsel” and will be analyzed in a manner that is consistent with the holdings in that decision. See id. at 730 n.8 and 741.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Compean, supra, as well as the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the motion to reopen shall be granted, the Board’s decision issued December 11, 2007, as well as the Immigration Judge’s decisions, are vacated, and the record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board En Banc: OSUNA, Chairman; HOLMES, FILPPU, MALPHRUS, and MULLANE, Board Members. Concurring Opinions: GRANT, Board Member; PAULEY, Board Member, joined by COLE, Board Member. Dissenting Opinion: GREER, Board Member, joined by NEAL, Vice Chairman; MILLER, HESS, ADKINS-BLANCH, and WENDTLAND, Board Members.
MALPHRUS, Board Member:
In a decision dated October 30, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his proceedings, in which he argued that his criminal conviction was not final because he had been granted permission to file a late appeal. The respondent has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on June 26, 1996. On October 11, 2007, the respondent was convicted of first degree burglary in violation of section 140.30 of the New York Penal Law.1 The record reflects that he failed to file an appeal within the 30-day deadline provided in *796 section 460.10(l)(a) of the New York Criminal Procedure Law. The respondent was placed in removal proceedings and was charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The Immigration Judge ordered him removed in a decision dated July 22, 2008. The respondent did not appeal that decision.
 
In a motion dated August 15, 2008, the respondent requested that the State criminal court grant him permission to file a late appeal pursuant to section 460.30 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law. Over opposition from the State, the court granted the respondent’s motion on September 26, 2008, reinstating the time for filing an appeal. The respondent filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings on October 14, 2008, claiming that his criminal conviction was not final because he had been granted permission to file a late appeal.2 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed the motion to reopen, arguing that the respondent’s conviction remained final and valid for immigration purposes. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent’s conviction remained a valid predicate for the charge of removability and denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.
  
II. ANALYSIS
 
**2 In 1996, Congress enacted section 322(a)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-628 (“IIRIRA”), which set forth a definition of the term “conviction.” This definition is in section 10 l(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A) (2006), which provides as follows:
The term “conviction” means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where—
(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and
 
(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed.
 
 
 
Initially, we must “determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). Issues regarding whether the language is plain and unambiguous are “determined by reference to the *797 language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Id. at 341.
 
The DHS argues that under the plain language of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, the respondent has a conviction because the State criminal court entered “a formal judgment of guilt” on October 11, 2007. The DHS therefore contends that even if the respondent had filed a direct appeal within 30 days of his conviction, the conviction would still be valid for immigration purposes. On the other hand, the respondent essentially argues that the language of section 101(a)(48)(A) is ambiguous as to the “particular dispute in the case,” id. at 340, specifically, the question of finality, and he claims that under case law that preceded the enactment of the IIRIRA, his conviction is not final for purposes of the immigration laws. It is not necessary to adopt either argument to determine the issue presented in this case.3
  
A.
 
When Congress enacted the IIRIRA and defined the term “conviction” for the first time, it expressed a clear intent to address convictions in the deferred adjudication context. Congress was concerned that convictions in this context should not be “dependent on the vagaries of State law” and intended to prevent the various ameliorative State court proceedings from undermining the immigration consequences of a violation of State criminal laws. Matter of Punu, 22 I&N Dec. 224, 229 (BIA 1998). Congress achieved this result by adopting almost verbatim key portions of our earlier decision in Matter of Ozkok, supra, at 551-52, which set forth a standard for determining the existence of a conviction for immigration purposes. But it also expanded the Ozkok definition of a conviction by eliminating that part of the standard under which a deferred adjudication was a conviction only if a judgment of guilt could be entered “without availability of further proceedings” in which *798 to contest the alien’s guilt. Thus, Congress provided that an alien who has a deferred adjudication with a finding of guilt and a punishment, penalty, or restraint on liberty has been convicted of the offense, regardless of the potential for further ameliorative criminal proceedings to affect that determination of guilt. See Matter of Punu, supra, at 227; see also H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 224 (1996) (Conf. Rep.), 1996 WL 563320 (stating that the “new provision, by removing the third prong of Ozkok, clarifies Congressional intent that even in cases where adjudication is ‘deferred,’ the original finding or confession of guilt is sufficient to establish a ‘conviction’ for purposes of the immigration laws”).
 
**3 At the time the IIRIRA was enacted, it was well established in immigration law that a criminal conviction attains finality for immigration purposes when procedures for direct appeal have been exhausted or waived. See Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546, 552 n.7 (BIA 1988); see also, e.g., Morales-Alvarado v. INS, 655 F.2d 172, 175 (9th Cir. 1981); Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, 516 F.2d 565, 570 (6th Cir. 1975). This well-accepted principle can be traced to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Pino v. Landon, 349 U.S. 901 (1955). The legislative history of the IIRIRA accompanying the adoption of the definition of a “conviction” gave no indication of an intent to disturb this principle that an alien must waive or exhaust his direct appeal rights to have a final conviction. See Matter of Punu, supra, at 227 (discussing the legislative history of the term “conviction” in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act).4 With this backdrop regarding the broad context of this issue and the statute, a forceful argument can be made that Congress intended to preserve the long-standing requirement of finality for direct appeals as of right in immigration law. See Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Gov’t, 522 U.S. 520, 530-31 (1998) (holding that Congress implicitly adopted the Supreme Court’s well-established definition of terms regarding a central issue in Indian law of what constitutes “Indian country” when it adopted language “taken virtually verbatim from” prior caselaw).
 
We need not resolve that issue, however, because the case before us involves a late-reinstated appeal, not a direct appeal. At the time Congress acted in 1996, there was no understanding of the effect on finality of late-reinstated appeals similar to the well-established rule for direct appeals. The Board expressly reserved this question less than 2 years before the *799 enactment of the IIRIRA in Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994), declining to decide whether late-reinstated appeals (also known as appeals taken nunc pro tunc, or “now for then”) should be accorded the same treatment with regard to finality as direct appeals as of right. Thus, regardless of the strength of the argument that Congress intended to preserve the traditional treatment of direct appeals, that argument fails in the context of late-reinstated appeals because Congress could not have intended to preserve something that did not exist.5
  
B.
 
Congress’s treatment of deferred adjudication proceedings in the IIRIRA informs our approach to late-reinstated appeals because both procedures present an added measure of delay and uncertainty regarding the consequences of criminal convictions in immigration proceedings. In order to resolve the issue left open in Matter of Polanco, supra, we look first to the statute.
 
**4 Section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act provides that a conviction exists when a “formal judgment of guilt” is “entered by a court,” a requirement that is satisfied here. Following the Ozkok rule in the context of deferred adjudication, Congress also determined that a conviction occurs upon an admission or finding of guilt and the imposition of “some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty.” Id. However, Congress eliminated *800 the additional part of the Ozkok rule that exempted criminal aliens with a deferred adjudication from the immigration consequences of a conviction if they retained a right to pursue further proceedings to contest their guilt at an unknown time in the future. In so doing, Congress reflected its concern about the problems presented by the indeterminate nature of such proceedings and clearly expressed its disfavor with aliens’ pursuit of avenues available under State laws to allow them to delay indefinitely the conclusion of immigration proceedings.
 
Even before Congress created a definition for the term “conviction” in the IIRIRA, there existed a “long-standing rule” that whether a conviction exists for immigration purposes “is a question of federal law and should not depend on the vagaries of state law.” Matter of Ozkok, supra, at 549, 551 n.6 (citing Matter of A-F-, 8 I&N Dec. 429, 446 (BIA, A.G. 1959)). Some of the problems arising from the various ameliorative procedures available under State law were implicit in Matter of Polanco, supra, which involved a New Jersey late-reinstated appeal procedure similar to that at issue in this case. The New Jersey court rules required that a request to file a nunc pro tunc appeal be made in a timely manner, although without a specific outside time limit. Furthermore, the criminal court’s determination whether to grant a request to file a late-reinstated appeal was “discretionary in nature” and therefore went beyond simply deciding if it was deemed to have been filed in a timely manner. Id. at 897. Thus, the procedure involved an unpredictable and indeterminate delay in immigration proceedings with no reasonable expectation that the alien would ultimately be granted relief from the conviction.
 
The concerns present in Matter of Polanco regarding the finality of a conviction subject to a late appeal process also exist in the New York procedure in this case. Section 460.10(1)(a) of New York Criminal Procedure Law provides for a direct appeal as of right within 30 days of a criminal conviction. However, if a defendant fails to meet this deadline, a motion may be filed within 1 year from the unmet deadline to present evidence showing that certain enumerated factors resulted in the defendant’s failure to appeal. Id. §§ 460.30(1)-(2); see also People v. Corso, 40 N.Y.2d 578 (1976). Thus, a defendant may file a motion requesting permission to file a late-reinstated appeal more than a year after he is convicted, provided that he also demonstrates “due diligence” in filing the motion. Id. §460.30(1). If the State opposes the motion, the appellate court must determine if a hearing is required and, if so, remand the matter to the trial court to conduct the hearing. Id. §§ 460.30(2)-(5). Furthermore, the decision on the motion itself may be appealed under certain circumstances. Id. §460.30(6). Thus, while New York law does have an eventual deadline for making a request to file a late appeal, the statute permits motions to file an appeal to be made over a year after the *801 criminal conviction, and the resolution of such motions has no time limit. Ultimately, if the appellate court grants the motion, a defendant may be provided an additional 30 days to actually file the late-reinstated appeal. Id. § 460.30(1).
 
**5 This New York procedure introduces a layer of uncertainty and delay far beyond that of a traditional appeal. This is, in part, a result of the long deadline for filing a motion and the unlimited nature of its resolution, but also because the procedure provides for a potentially extensive fact-based and judgment-laden inquiry. For example, the State court must determine the reason for the delay in filing a motion and whether the defendant acted with “due diligence” in filing it.6 Id. § 460.30(1). The court could also be required to resolve whether a public servant or a defendant’s attorney engaged in “improper conduct.” Id. Thus, the late-reinstated appeal procedure under New York law is very different from the typical direct appeal as of right, which imposes prompt filing deadlines and requires only a ministerial act in accepting a notice of appeal.
 
Concerns regarding uncertainty in removal proceedings are amplified in the context of a motion to reopen, which is a disfavored process that imposes a heavy burden on the moving party to show that reopening is warranted. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107, 111 (1988). Finality and predictability are important principles in the law, including in immigration law. See INS v. Abudu, supra, at 107 (“There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases.”).7
 
In this case, removal proceedings were initiated, the Immigration Judge held a hearing, and the respondent was ordered removed, all before he even filed his motion for a late-reinstated appeal in State court. He then sought to reopen his removal proceedings based on a claim that his conviction is no longer final. The respondent was permitted to reinstate the time to appeal his conviction under a special State procedure that creates significant uncertainty and delay in reaching an ultimate resolution regarding the existence of an otherwise final *802 conviction. Congress intended to prevent the immigration laws from being “dependent on the vagaries of State law” when it defined the term “conviction” in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent’s pending late-reinstated appeal does not undermine the finality of his conviction for purposes of the immigration laws and conclude that it is therefore not appropriate to reopen and terminate these proceedings.8
  
III. CONCLUSION
 
Given the indeterminate nature of the New York late appeal procedure and Congress’s clear intent to give broad effect to the definition of a conviction in the deferred adjudication context, we find that the respondent’s conviction remains a valid factual predicate for the charge of removability. We therefore conclude the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
**6 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
**7 CONCURRING OPINION Edward R. Grant, Board Member
I respectfully concur.
 
I join in the well-reasoned decision of the majority. While it may not be absolutely necessary in this case to address the underlying question whether the “finality” requirement is still applicable and binding in removal proceedings, I would nevertheless do so. For the reasons cogently stated in the dissent, I would find that the “finality” requirement does still apply to cases where a direct appeal is pending or direct appeal rights have not been exhausted.
 
Fortunately, it appears that both the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration Judges continue to follow this rule. Even in those circuits where the court of appeals has indicated that the finality rule is no longer binding, it is a sound exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and in keeping with the goal of uniform administration of the immigration laws, to refrain from initiating *803 removal proceedings based on a criminal conviction until any right of direct appeal from that conviction has been exhausted or waived.
 
For the reasons stated in the majority, this is just such a case. Removal proceedings were held in abeyance until well after the statutory period for direct appeal had expired. Those proceedings continued and resulted in the entry of an order of removal. It was only then that the respondent chose to take advantage of the unique “late-filed” appeal procedure available under New York law. Just as the initiation of removal proceedings prior to exhaustion or expiration of direct appeal rights would undermine the uniform enforcement of immigration laws, allowing an alien to forestall such proceedings, once properly begun, by filing a “late” appeal would impede the administration of justice.
 
Exceptions to this ruling may apply if the alien were to present compelling evidence of the likelihood of success on his late-filed criminal appeal. In such circumstances, sound judgment would dictate that proceedings before the Immigration Judge or this Board be held in abeyance until resolution of the appeal. But no such showing has been made in this case.
 
CONCURRING OPINION Roger A. Pauley, Board Member, in which Patricia A. Cole, Board Member, joined
Although I join the majority opinion insofar as it addresses the finality issue in the narrow context of statutes that permit the late reinstatement of a direct appeal of a conviction, I write separately to respond to the dissenting opinion insofar as it contends that finality still generally exists as a requirement for a “conviction” for immigration purposes, notwithstanding the plain language of section 101(a)(48) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A) (2006), an assertion not gainsaid (and indeed arguably supported in dicta) by the majority opinion. As explained herein, the dissenting opinion is incorrect for many reasons.
 
I.
**8 To begin with, the rationale of the dissent is incompatible with Supreme Court authority. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U.S. 184(1991). To comprehend why, imagine that no agency such as the Board ever existed and that Congress were now creating the definition of a “conviction” in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act for the first time. It is undisputed that the definition nowhere expressly embodies the requirement that, in immigration proceedings, a conviction must have been affirmed on direct appeal or that the time for taking a direct appeal must have expired in order for it to be deemed a “conviction.” Ordinarily, and in the hypothetical circumstances described *804 above, were Congress to enact such plain language which lacks a “finality” requirement, I do not understand the dissenting opinion to deny that the text would command obedience. I believe it does so here as well. The dissent, however, purports to find contextual ambiguity in the otherwise clear and complete definition provided by Congress,1 permitting those joining that opinion to deem the finality concept implicitly preserved, arising from the Board’s long-standing previous understanding that a “conviction” for immigration purposes must have attained finality in the sense of having been affirmed on direct appeal, or the waiver of, or elapsing of the time to take, such an appeal having occurred. See Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546, 552 n.7 (BIA 1988).
 
Unsurprisingly, no case law supports this novel proposition. To the contrary, as noted above, it is squarely at odds with Demarest v. Manspeaker, supra. Therein, the Court noted that the court of appeals below had “relied on long-standing administrative construction of the statute denying attendance fees to prisoners, and two Court of Appeals decisions to the same effect, followed by congressional revision of the statute in 1978.” Id. at 190 (footnote omitted). The Court, however, unanimously rejected the administrative and judicial construction placed upon the statute, finding that the language of the statute was clear and did not lead to absurd or bizarre results, and that “administrative interpretation of a statute contrary to language as plain as we find here is not entitled to deference.” Id. The situation in Demarest v. Manspeaker is directly analogous, save only that there the agency’s past interpretation of a term was supported by holdings of two appellate courts,  *805 which is not the case here. Thus, Demarest v. Manspeaker alone is a refutation of the dissent’s analysis.2
 
Both the dissenting and the majority opinions invoke Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Gov’t, 522 U.S. 520 (1998). But that case is not analogous. Even assuming no distinction for statutory construction purposes between prior Supreme Court decisions and administrative agency interpretations, in terms of the respect deemed to be accorded them by Congress, the Court in Alaska v. Native Village pegged its decision to the fact that the legislative history of the statute at issue reflected that it was intended by Congress to codify the Supreme Court’s own prior decisions. Id. at 530. In contrast, all the dissent can muster by way of legislative history is congressional silence. This is insufficient.
 
**9 Moreover, Alaska v. Native Village construed a statute where Congress adopted the entirety of the definition contained in the Supreme Court’s prior decisions defining Indian country. Here, by contrast, Congress did not adopt in whole the Board’s prior understanding of the term “conviction.” To the contrary, it adopted only a portion thereof and indeed embodied as an express (and executed in language) purpose to eliminate any requirement, previously embodied in the Board’s prior practice and understanding, pertaining to finality in the deferred adjudication context. To infer from this a purpose of Congress to retain the principle of finality elsewhere in the definition, wholly unsupported by any legislative language or history, is simply to make an illogical leap. Thus, absent any wholesale adoption in the text of the definition enacted as section 101(a)(48) of the Board’s previous understanding regarding the necessity that a conviction have attained “finality,” or even any legislative history reflecting an intent to preserve the principle of finality for types of convictions other than deferred adjudications, reliance on Alaska v. Native Village is unavailing.
 
In addition and significantly, Congress elected to define a “conviction” very precisely, using the limiting term “means” instead of allowing for a broader administrative or judicial interpretation by using the enlarging term “includes” to communicate nonexclusivity. As the Supreme Court has recognized, a “‘definition which declares what a term “means” … *806 excludes any meaning that is not stated.”’ Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392 n.10 (1979) (quoting 2A C. Sands, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47.07 (4th ed. Supp. 1978)); see also Burgess v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 1572, 1578 n.3 (2008).
 
Furthermore, the dissenting opinion’s unwarranted creation of a new exception to the plain language rule would tend to undermine the separation of powers and confer upon the Board (and by extension all administrative agencies charged with the interpretation of the statute or statutes they administer) a power to influence the content of legislation derived from its prior practice and understanding of a term, notwithstanding that Congress has undertaken for the first time to define it and has nowhere incorporated that understanding or practice in its definition. For Congress to be found to have rejected the Board’s understanding that finality is a component of a conviction, the dissent concludes, it is insufficient for Congress merely to fail to include any reference to finality in its language. Silence in an otherwise complete definition is not enough. The dissent’s remarkable position is that Congress, partially constrained by the Board’s prior understanding of a “conviction,” must have acted affirmatively in statutory language to repudiate it, before they will acknowledge that it has been superseded.3 The dissent’s measured prose cannot disguise the radical nature of its thesis, one that siphons lawmaking authority from Congress and vests it in administrative agencies such as the Board.
 
**10 In sum and in essence, the dissenting opinion falls into fundamental error in exalting the legislative history, consisting merely of an absence of expression of intent to discard or alter the Board’s previous understanding that a conviction requires finality, over the plain statutory language employed by Congress that does just that in that it contains no such finality element. While silence may in some circumstances be a useful clue in criminal investigations, see, e.g., Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Silver Blaze, in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1892) (regarding the case of the dog that didn’t bark), it is not a reliable indicator of congressional purpose in the face of otherwise plain language. Indeed, the point of plain language is that it requires no explanation. See Avco Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 884 F.2d 621, 623 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (noting the waggish doctrine that it is only where the statutory history is ambiguous that a court will look to the words of the statute).
 
*807 II.
The regulations also support the conclusion that the definition of the term “conviction” in section 101(a)(48) of the Act, enacted in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (“IIRIRA”), lacks a finality element. The regulations contain no provision, applicable to removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a (2006), generally, that treats the term “conviction” as defined in the Act. This fact further supports the notion that the statutory language is clear and complete on its face and requires no elaboration.
 
However, tellingly, in implementing the provisions of the Act dealing with the expedited removal of nonlawful permanent resident aliens convicted of one or more aggravated felonies, the Attorney General, in 1997 shortly after the enactment of the IIRIRA, promulgated regulations that address section 238 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1228 (2006). The regulations provide in pertinent part that for an alien to be subject to expedited removal, the alien must have “been convicted (as defined in section 101(a)(48) of the Act …) of an aggravated felony and such conviction has become final.” 8 C.F.R. § 1238. l(b)(iii) (2008). If the definition of a “conviction” enacted by the IIRIRA bore the understanding, as the dissent contends, that a conviction must have attained finality, it would have been unnecessary for the regulation to specify that the conviction must have become final. It is true that the regulation carried forward a finality of conviction requirement in the regulations implementing a similar provision in the Act prior to the IIRIRA. See 8 C.F.R. § 242.25(b)(iii) (1996). The fact remains, however, that the current regulation, issued hard on the heels of the IIRIRA’s enactment of a definition of the term “conviction” for the first time, coupled with the absence of any like regulation specifying a finality principle applicable to removal proceedings generally, is consistent with the clear language of the statute and reflects an understanding that that definition itself embodies no finality requirement. A regulation is to be construed like a statute, and it is a basic rule of construction, albeit not woodenly applied, not to deem language therein to be superfluous. See, e.g., Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 128 S. Ct. 831, 840 (2008); Connecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253 (1992).
 
III.
**11 Also as a matter of concern, the dissent’s position would place the Board in opposition to the holdings of three courts of appeals that the concept of finality did not survive the enactment of the definition of a “conviction” in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. It would also be in conflict with the considered dicta *808 to the same effect of two additional circuits, including the one in which this case arises.4 The dissent’s attempt to depreciate the force of the decisions from the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits, whose holdings are based on the plain language of the statute and are not subject to being supplanted through the doctrine of deference afforded to agency interpretations of ambiguous provisions,5 is misplaced.6 Moreover, for its part, the dissent can point to no holding or even considered dicta of a court of appeals in support of its analysis or result.7 Likewise, the dissent’s, and to some extent the majority’s, reliance on or noting of the fact that Congress explicitly retained the requirement of finality in a few selected provisions of the Act, at best, does not aid the case that finality in a more general sense was preserved. Indeed, that circumstance may well cut the other way. See Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 528-29 (2003) (reiterating the maxim that “[w]hen ‘Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act … it is generally presumed that *809 Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion”’ (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983))).
 
IV.
Likewise, even the underlying premise of the dissenting opinion—that a prior practice of the Board existed to require finality, which Congress purportedly carried forward implicitly—is not borne out in this case. As the majority opinion persuasively explains, while such a prior understanding existed generally, see Matter of Ozkok, supra, no such prior practice or understanding existed in the instant circumstances where the conviction originally attained finality because the time to appeal expired, but the alien’s right to appeal was restored due to a State procedure allowing, in certain cases, for the recognition of a late appeal. Such a procedure has many of the trappings of a collateral challenge to a conviction such that, at best from the perspective of the dissent, prior to the IIRIRA’s enactment of the definition of a “conviction,” it was debatable whether, even though the defendant’s motion once granted restores a defendant’s full direct appeal rights, the conviction should be deemed to have attained finality.8 In what appears to be the only instance in which the Board, in a published decision, addressed the finality question in this context, we expressly declined to decide it. Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894, 898 (BIA 1994) (expressly reserving the question of “what effect proof of a pending nunc pro tunc appeal might have on the finality of [a] conviction.”). Absent a single prior Board precedent, much less a long-standing practice addressing this situation, the dissent’s reliance on the contextual ambiguity of the otherwise plain language of the definition of a conviction enacted in 1996, arising from the Board’s allegedly long-standing contrary understanding, falls by the wayside.
 
V.
**12 Last, I wish to note that I have no quarrel from a policy perspective with the concept of finality as previously applied by the Board. It is within a range *810 of reasonable policy choices available to Congress and serves to assure that an alien found removable on the basis of a conviction, who has a direct appeal of that conviction pending, may not be removed. On the other hand, that the elimination of finality, as three courts of appeals have rightly concluded was accomplished by section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, likewise is not unreasonable. See supra note 6. There is no constitutional right to an appeal of a conviction, and, indeed, for many years in our nation’s history no such opportunity was provided. See Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 656 (1977). Moreover, even today a defendant may be compelled to serve in full his or her sentence despite the pendency of a direct appeal. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1) (2006). Congress could also consider that only a small fraction of criminal appeals by defendants is successful, and that applying “finality” as the Board had understood it prevents the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) from instituting removal proceedings against, and taking into custody, aliens whom it regards as dangerous and who are at large pending appeal of their convictions.9 Thus, strong policy considerations also support eliminating the finality requirement.10 But the point is that the policy is not ours to make, but that of Congress, and Congress has clearly made its decision through the plain language it adopted in section 101(a)(48)(A), which contains no finality requirement.
 
VI. CONCLUSION
As demonstrated above, the position of the dissenting opinion is unsupportable on a number of fronts. While it would reach an outcome that *811 some may applaud, and that Congress is free to adopt, it would bestow on the Board a power it does not possess and would effectively legislate by adding to, rather than interpreting, the definition of the term “conviction” in the Act. Because I agree with the outcome and reasoning of the majority opinion as it pertains to finality in the limited situation, as here, of a late-reinstated appeal, and profoundly disagree with the position of the dissent that would find finality in all contexts to have been preserved without a shred of support therefor in the statutory language, I respectfully concur.11
 
**13 DISSENTING OPINION Anne J. Greer, Board Member, in which David L. Neal, Vice Chairman; Neil P. Miller, Frederick D. Hess, Charles K. Adkins-Blanch, and Linda S. Wendtland, Board Members, joined
The respondent seeks termination of proceedings because the criminal conviction underlying the charge of deportation is pending on direct appeal. I agree with the respondent that his conviction must still be “final” under the statutory definition for a conviction at section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A) (2006), an issue which the majority declines to reach. Unlike the majority, I conclude that the pendency of a direct appeal pursuant to section 460.30 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law means that the respondent’s conviction is not final for immigration purposes.
 
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident on or about June 26, 1996. On or about October 11, 2007, the respondent was convicted of burglary in the first degree in violation of section 140.30 of the New York Penal Law. As a result, he was charged as deportable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006), as having been convicted of an aggravated felony under section 10 l(a)(43)(G) of the Act. In removal proceedings, the Immigration Judge annotated the Notice to Appear to indicate that the respondent admitted these factual allegations *812 and, as to the conviction, had taken “no appeal yet.” On July 22, 2008, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States to the Dominican Republic. On October 14, 2008, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, presenting evidence that his criminal conviction was pending on direct appeal pursuant to a September 26, 2008, grant of his motion for an extension of time to appeal under section 460.30 of New York Criminal Procedure Law. The facts are not disputed, including that the respondent’s criminal conviction is now pending on direct appeal as of right.
 
II. ISSUES
The first issue presented is whether a criminal conviction underlying a charge of deportability or inadmissibility is required to attain finality under the statutory definition of a conviction at section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, enacted as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (“IIRIRA”). If finality is required, the issue remains whether the respondent’s pending late-filed appeal constitutes a direct appeal of his criminal conviction.
 
III. WHETHER FINALITY IS REQUIRED
**14 Prior to the 1996 addition of a definition for the term “conviction” in the Act, the prevailing standard to evaluate whether a conviction existed for immigration purposes was set forth by this Board in Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546 (BIA 1988). Neither the Ozkok definition nor the statutory definition explicitly addresses finality, although the Board explained in Ozkok that a criminal conviction continued to require finality in order to sustain a charge of deportation. Id. at 552 n.7. In enacting the IIRIRA, Congress chose language to define a conviction in terms that mirror key portions of the Board’s definition in Ozkok. The deliberate use of parallel language reinforces the long-held administrative and judicial requirement of “finality” that was incorporated in Ozkok. The source of the language enacted is needed to ascertain the plain meaning of this statutory definition, which is silent regarding finality. Significantly, in the Board’s other precedent decisions examining the plain meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, we considered the relevant context in the absence of specific statutory language speaking to the issue at hand. That same approach applies here.
 
*813 A. History of Finality in the Immigration Context
Under Matter of Ozkok, supra, a State deferred adjudication that provided for a contingent right to contest guilt did not equate to a conviction, whereas State deferred adjudications that did not afford this contingency qualified.1 According to Ozkok, a conviction exists for immigration purposes where an alien has had a formal judgment of guilt entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where all of the following elements are present: (1) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or he has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty, (2) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the person’s liberty to be imposed, and (3) a judgment or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the person violates the terms of his probation or fails to comply with the requirements of the court’s order, without availability of further proceedings regarding his guilt or innocence of the original charge.2 This definition of a conviction was widely upheld by Federal circuit courts of appeals.3
 
In addition to being required to meet the Ozkok criteria, an alien’s criminal conviction did not support a finding of deportability until it became final. Indeed, Ozkok specifically explained that the definition of a conviction continued to incorporate the well-settled doctrine of finality. In particular, the Board clarified that “[i]t is well established that a conviction does not attain a sufficient degree of finality for immigration purposes until direct appellate *814 review of the conviction has been exhausted or waived.” Id. at 552 n.7 (citing Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686 (2d Cir. 1976); Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, 516 F.2d 565, 570 (6th Cir. 1975); Will v. INS, 447 F.2d 529 (7th Cir. 1971)). Ozkok and the circuit court cases it cites regarding finality look to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Pino v. Landon, 349 U.S. 901 (1955) (per curiam), rev’g Pino v. Nicolls, 215 F.2d 237 (1st Cir. 1954). The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court by stating: “On the record here we are unable to say that the conviction has attained such finality as to support an order of deportation within the contemplation of [former section] 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” Id.
 
**15 Historically, a conviction attained finality for immigration purposes when the alien had either waived or exhausted his direct appeal rights. See, e.g., Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, supra. During the pendency of an alien’s direct appeal of a criminal conviction, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service accordingly did not commence deportation proceedings. If deportation proceedings were initiated on the basis of a criminal conviction under direct appellate review, the Immigration Judge had a legal basis to terminate the proceedings. The line of cases following Ozkok prior to the IIRIRA’s enactment continued to recognize that a conviction must attain a reasonable degree of certainty through waiver or exhaustion of direct appeals of right to serve as a basis for a charge of deportation under the Act. See, e.g., Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211 (5th Cir. 1995) (discussing finality in the context of waiver or exhaustion of a direct appeal); cf. Matter of Onyido, 22 I&N Dec. 552, 555 (BIA 1999) (explaining that the respondent had a final conviction after the enactment of the IIRIRA where he entered a guilty plea from which there was no right of direct appeal).
 
In the IIRIRA, Congress defined a conviction as “a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.” Section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. Where adjudication of guilt is deferred, Congress enacted most of the Ozkok test to determine whether a conviction exists. Given that Congress chose to adopt Ozkok, except for its third prong addressing a specific category of deferred adjudications, I conclude that Congress was aware of and accepted the decisions of the Supreme Court, the United States courts of appeals, and this Board underlying and affirming Ozkok, with regard to finality. Congress’s adoption of existing language used in an established Board precedent is akin to reenacting a portion of an existing statute while intending to preserve its attendant administrative and judicial interpretations. See generally Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., 470 U.S. 768, 782 n. 15 (1985) (“‘So too, where, as here, Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute.”’ (quoting Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580-81 (1978))).
 
*815 Here Congress effectively enacted language from a Board precedent decision defining a conviction, while clearly omitting one of the Board’s three requirements in the deferred adjudication context. In these circumstances, it can be presumed that Congress was aware of, and intended to preserve, the administrative and judicial interpretations attendant to the portions of the Board precedent it enacted, particularly given the importance of the finality doctrine in the immigration context.
 
**16 This view is consistent with the Supreme Court’s analysis in Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Gov’t, 522 U.S. 520 (1998). In Alaska v. Native Village, the Court held that the term “dependent Indian communities,” as used in a statute defining “Indian country,” was to be interpreted consistently with judicial precedents issued prior to the statute’s enactment. Id. at 528-31. These precedents required a Federal Government set-aside for use as Indian land, together with Federal superintendence. While the statute did not explicitly mention those well-established requirements, the Court observed that the statute’s text derived directly from judicial precedent and found that the statute did not alter the existing definition established by case law. Likewise, Congress took the pertinent text of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act verbatim from Matter of Ozkok, supra, and did not purport to alter the recognition in Ozkok and other precedents of a finality requirement for convictions serving as the factual predicate for deportability or inadmissibility. See also Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605 (1994) (observing that the Court must construe a statute in light of the background rules of common law, in which the requirement of some mens rea for a crime is firmly embedded); cf. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U.S. 184, 190 (1991) (observing that “[t]here is no indication that Congress was aware of the administrative construction, or of the appellate decisions, at the time it revised the statute”).
 
B. Board Interpretation of Section 101(a)(48)
The statutory language enacted by Congress to define a “conviction” is silent as to the significance of both post-conviction ameliorative actions and finality. Both must be addressed by the Board in interpreting this statute.4 See generally Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984); see also Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967 (2005). We have issued a series of precedent decisions addressing the effect of State post-conviction actions on a conviction *816 under section 10 l(a)(48)(A) of the Act. In these decisions, we looked beyond the statute’s plain words and considered relevant context in construing the statute, which approach applies here.
 
In our first decision addressing the meaning of the new definition set forth in the IIRIRA, we relied on the statutory language but also examined the legislative history, which explained congressional intent to eliminate the third prong of Ozkok to avoid inconsistent outcomes for deferred adjudications. Matter of Punu, 22 I&N Dec. 224, 227 (BIA 1998) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 224 (1996) (Conf. Rep.), 1996 WL 563320)). In Punu, we identified Congress’s intent as set forth in the legislative history to “make it easier to remove criminal aliens, regardless of specific procedures in States for deferred adjudication:” Id. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 104-879 (1997), 1997 WL 9288 at *295) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we found it to be “clear that Congress deliberately modified the definition of conviction to include deferred adjudications.” Id. (emphasis added). Next, in Matter of Roldan, 22 I&N Dec. 512 (BIA 1999), we recognized that the plain language of the new statutory definition did not address the effect of State post-conviction actions on a conviction for immigration purposes, requiring us to “‘look to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.”’ Id. at 521 (quoting K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291(1988)).
 
**17 In employing this contextual approach, we concluded in Roldan that certain vacated or expunged convictions continue to serve as valid factual predicates for a charge of deportation, despite a lack of express language to that effect in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. Then, in Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000), and Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), we concluded that convictions vacated on the basis of a procedural or legal defect in the underlying criminal proceedings do not remain convictions for immigration purposes.5 Our statutory interpretation of the conviction definition regarding post-conviction modification has been well received by *817 the circuit courts,6 with the exception of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.7
 
Here, as with finality, section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act does not specifically speak to the effect of post-conviction actions addressed at altering the underlying conviction. While the statute could be read to eliminate the effect of all post-conviction measures, including substantive vacaturs, as stated by the Eleventh Circuit, such an approach would be “so foreign, so antithetical, to the long-standing principles underlying our criminal justice system and our notions of due process that we would expect Congress to have spoken very clearly if it intended to effect such results.” Alim v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 1239, 1249 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing United States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310, 322(1892)).8
 
As we said in Roldan, “Congress has approved the federal approach taken in Ozkok, but has gone even further than Ozkok by eliminating the one prong of our former definition which required an examination of how a specific state structured its rehabilitative statute.” Matter of Roldan, supra, at 522. In my view, Congress approved the Ozkok Federal approach that incorporated finality, rather than eliminating the requirement through silence on the subject. See generally Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 698-99 (1979) (finding the legal context at the time of a statute’s enactment relevant in evaluating congressional action and stating that it was “not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with … important precedents from … federal courts and that it expected its *818 enactment to be interpreted in conformity with them”); see also Zuni Public Schools Dist. No. 89 v. Dep’t of Educ., 127 S. Ct. 1534, 1545-46 (2007) (noting that the “‘[m]eaning—or ambiguity—of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context”’ (quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000))).
 
**18 The concurrence of Board Member Pauley disavows any intention to treat convictions subjected to substantive vacaturs as giving rise to removability, and it endeavors to justify its different approach in that context by pointing to the maxim that permits deviating from plain statutory language when its literal application would lead to absurd results. Notably, however, the Eleventh Circuit did not employ such a rationale when it held that convictions that are vacated for underlying defects become invalid for immigration purposes in Alim v. Gonzales, supra. Rather, the court concluded that section 101(a)(48)(A) “does not specify” how to treat such convictions, but instead “defines a conviction up through the time of sentence,” while “say[ing] nothing about what effect, if any, the conviction or plea should be given when there is a subsequent vacatur because the alien’s statutory or constitutional rights were violated during the underlying criminal proceeding.” Id. at 1248 (emphasis added). The court thus found “statutory silence,” rather than relying on plain language, and turned to addressing the reasonableness of the Board’s construction of the statute. Id. at 1249.9
 
C. Circuit Court Consideration of Finality Under Section 101(a)(48)(A)
Six circuit courts of appeals, including the Second Circuit, have addressed finality under section 10 l(a)(48)(A) of the Act with differing results. None of the decisions of these courts examines the issue as it is presented here, i.e., during the pendency of a direct appeal of the conviction supporting removal. See, e.g., Alim v. Gonzales, supra, at 1248 (explaining that precedent dealing with the ongoing validity of convictions set aside for State rehabilitative purposes did not address, and therefore did not govern, the situation presented). The Second Circuit has observed in dicta that the IIRIRA *819 eliminated the requirement for finality under section 101(a)(48)(A). Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Servs., 511 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2007). Puello did not involve a challenge based on an appeal of a conviction. The alien in Puello had pled guilty and was challenging the effective date of the conviction for purposes of his naturalization application. The Fifth Circuit in Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 284, 290-91 (5th Cir. 2007), also noted in dicta that finality is no longer required. However, the court clarified that no “appeal [was] actually pending for [the alien’s] … conviction.” Id. at 290; see also Moosa v. INS, 171 F.3d 994 (5th Cir. 1999) (addressing deferred adjudication rather than a direct appeal of a criminal conviction). Moreover, in Garcia-Maldonado, the court relied chiefly on its prior holding in Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, supra, that even a conviction that has actually been vacated for substantive legal defects would remain valid for immigration purposes.
 
**19 The Third and Sixth Circuits have found finality to be preserved. In United States v. Garcia-Echaverria, 374 F.3d 440, 445 (6th Cir. 2004), the court stated that “[t]o support an order of deportation, a conviction must be final” in terms of exhaustion of direct appeal rights. In Garcia-Echaverria, which is a criminal illegal reentry case, the court held that the alien’s conviction was final for immigration purposes. The court found that the appeals at issue were “collateral attacks upon Garcia-Echaverria’s conviction,” filed after the time expiration of the direct appeal deadline, and concluded that his “conviction was final for removal purposes.” Id. at 446. Most recently, in Paredes v. Attorney General of U.S., 528 F.3d 196, 198 (3d Cir. 2008), the court, quoting the now superseded Ozkok as controlling without discussing the statutory conviction definition, observed that “‘[a] conviction does not attain a sufficient degree of finality for immigration purposes until direct appellate review of the conviction has been exhausted or waived.”’
 
While the Tenth Circuit has held that finality is no longer required in United States v. Saenz-Gomez, 472 F.3d 791, 794 (10th Cir. 2007), which arose in the sentence enhancement context, I observe that at the time of the court’s decision, the alien’s criminal appeals had already been dismissed by the New Mexico Court of Appeals and the New Mexico Supreme Court. Id. at 792. Recognizing that the court held that a conviction already existed for immigration purposes at the time of the alien’s removal from the United States, prior to defense counsel’s filing of his direct criminal appeal, I respectfully disagree with that aspect of the holding. In Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F. 3d 1035, 1037 (7th Cir. 2004), the Seventh Circuit’s consideration of finality was also moot because the alien’s direct appeals had been exhausted at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari almost 5 years before the Seventh Circuit’s decision. See Montenegro v. Illinois, 525 U.S. 1158 (1999) (denying certiorari).
 
*820 In Griffiths v. INS, 243 F.3d 45, 53 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001), the court highlighted the distinction between a deferred adjudication and a direct appeal for purposes of finality. In Griffiths, the First Circuit reserved the question whether finality remains intact, agreeing with the Board that the alien had been the subject of a deferred adjudication, which does constitute a conviction under the section 101(a)(48)(A) statutory definition. Significantly, in Griffiths, the court observed that “[t]here are substantial practical differences between the situation faced by a defendant currently exercising a direct appellate right and that faced by a defendant with a theoretically available right to appeal.” Id. at 54.10
 
**20 Thus, the circuit court decisions—both those that find the requirement of finality retained and those that find it superseded—offer conflicting statements in circumstances different from the instant case that heighten the Board’s responsibility to interpret the Act. See generally Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., supra (holding that a court’s prior judicial construction of a statute prevails over an agency construction that is otherwise entitled to deference under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., supra, only if the prior court decision holds that the construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion).
 
D. Finality Preserved Elsewhere in the Act
If Congress had intended to remove the finality requirement under the Act, it presumably would have done so uniformly throughout the Act, rather than leaving finality intact in other provisions without apparent justification. See, e.g., sections 237(a)(2)(D), 238(c)(3)(A)(iii), 241(a)(4)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(D), 1228(c)(3)(A)(iii), 1231(a)(4)(B) (2006). We find reading finality out of the Act in this manner to be impermissible because it fails to *821 “interpret the statute ‘as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme’ … and ‘fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole.”’ FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., supra, at 133 (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 569 (1995), and FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 389 (1959)).11
 
IV. WHETHER A PENDING APPEAL UNDER SECTION 460.30 OF THE NEW YORK CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW IS A FINAL CONVICTION
Direct appeals for purposes of finality are interpreted to mean direct appeals of right, not including the potential for discretionary review on direct appeal. For example, the Board held in Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994), that an alien who did not exercise his direct appeal of right under New Jersey law had a final conviction, despite the potential for seeking a discretionary nunc pro tunc appeal. Of significance to the Board in Polanco were the indeterminate time available to file the appeal and the appeal’s discretionary nature. The majority and concurring opinions maintain that because we left open the question whether the authorization of a discretionary nunc pro tunc appeal would render a conviction not final for immigration purposes in Matter of Polanco, supra, there is no history of administrative applications of the finality rule in the “late appeal” context. This position overlooks our conclusion in Polanco that the kind of “late appeal” at issue was like a collateral attack, rather than a direct appeal, because the pertinent State law set forth no deadline for seeking authorization to file the late appeal, and the decision whether to authorize the appeal was largely discretionary. Cf. Jimenez v. Quarterman, 129 S. Ct. 681 (2009) (finding that for purposes of triggering the limitations period for Federal habeas review, the date of the conviction’s finality was the date of conclusion of the direct appeal that the State court had granted a right to file out of time).
 
**21 I must respectfully disagree with the majority opinion’s characterization of New York’s procedure for obtaining a nunc pro tunc extension of the time for taking a direct criminal appeal as creating too much “uncertainty and delay” *822 to affect a conviction’s finality for immigration purposes. Matter of Cardenas Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 801 (BIA 2009). Section 460.30(1) of the New York Criminal Procedure Law provides for a late appeal under only very limited circumstances, requiring the defendant to demonstrate that his failure to file an appeal during the normal time period resulted from either (a) “improper conduct of a public servant or improper conduct, death or disability of the defendant’s attorney,” or (b) “inability of the defendant and his attorney to have communicated, in person or by mail, concerning whether an appeal should be taken, prior to the expiration of the time within which to take an appeal[,] due to [the] defendant’s incarceration in an institution and through no lack of due diligence or fault of the attorney or defendant.” Further, the defendant must exercise due diligence in filing his extension motion, and in any case must do so not more than 1 year after the normal appeal period’s expiration. Id. Although the court may order further fact-finding if necessary, the extension motion “must” ultimately be granted if a legal basis for it is ultimately demonstrated. Id. §§ 460.30(3)-(5).
 
This procedure is a far cry from the New Jersey procedure that was involved in Matter of Polanco, supra. In that case we found it “significant” that there were “no time constraints whatsoever to limit the period” during which permission to take a nunc pro tunc appeal could be sought. Id. at 897. We also relied heavily on New Jersey’s treatment of such motions as “discretionary in nature.” Id. Although the majority opinion observes that New York’s implementation of its procedure for determining whether its mandatory late-appeal criteria have, in fact, been satisfied can potentially result in time delays of indeterminate length, the same could be said of the process for adjudication of criminal appeals generally. But Congress has never determined that such timing considerations outweigh the importance of ensuring that a conviction has attained a sufficient degree of finality before it can give rise to a removal order.
 
Moreover, the fact that New York in this instance has actually authorized a late criminal appeal necessarily means that it has determined that the respondent has, in fact, demonstrated, after exercising due diligence, that his failure to file a timely appeal resulted from improper conduct by a public servant or by the respondent’s criminal defense attorney, the death or disability of that attorney, or an inability of the respondent and his attorney to communicate in a timely manner about a potential criminal appeal because of his incarceration, and through no fault of his own. If New York wishes to authorize extensions of time for filing direct criminal appeals under these kinds of circumstances, I do not believe that it is the province of this Board to effectively determine for immigration purposes that such appeals are not legitimately “direct” after all. Indeed, for purposes of removal proceedings, this Board, the Attorney General, or Congress has determined that the same *823 kinds of circumstances can warrant tolling or (in at least one circumstance) negation of an otherwise applicable deadline. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (holding that, in the exercise of discretion, the Board may toll the deadline for filing a motion to reopen where the alien demonstrates, and exercises due diligence in discovering, deficient performance of counsel); section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S. C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) (2006) (providing that a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order may be filed “at any time” if the alien demonstrates that he was in Federal or State custody at the time of his hearing, and that his failure to appear was through no fault of his own). Although the majority opinion would find it determinative that New York’s procedure for extending criminal appeal deadlines nunc pro tunc is not equivalent to “the typical direct appeal as of right, which imposes prompt filing deadlines and requires only a ministerial act in accepting a notice of appeal,” Matter of Cardenas Abreu, supra, at 801, I would not impose such inflexible conditions on direct appeals for the purpose of determining the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes, particularly when we have not done so in the context of setting deadlines for motions filed in removal proceedings.
 
V. CONCLUSION
**22 Absent clear statutory language to the contrary, I would find that the historically accepted rule of finality in immigration law continues to apply when a charge of removal requires a criminal conviction. In doing so, I recognize that the consequences of removal in some cases might very well be considered severe enough to ensure that a reasonable degree of finality has been attained in terms of exhaustion or waiver of direct appeals of right, essentially ensuring that no premature removal occurs. I do not believe that Congress’s explicit concern over deferred adjudications, which by definition provide an opportunity for mitigation after the establishment of guilt, encompasses a challenge to guilt through the direct appeals process.12
 
In my view, the New York statute allowing for late-filed direct appeals preserves a respondent’s direct appeal rights. As such, the conviction does not trigger civil removal consequences for an alien—if the late-filed appeal is accepted by the appellate court and until it is resolved. Accordingly, I would sustain the respondent’s appeal and terminate removal proceedings.

The granting of this motion to reopen would require that these removal proceedings be terminated. Also, the respondent would not be subject to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security on this basis.

In Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, 511 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2007), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, reasoned in dicta that the statutory definition of the term “conviction” in section 101(a)(48)(A) eliminated the finality requirement. However, that case related to the effective date of a conviction and did not involve a challenge based on the appeal of a conviction. Other circuit courts that have addressed the principle of finality since the enactment of the IIRIRA have applied disparate analyses to reach different conclusions, and none has considered the issue in the context of a late-reinstated appeal. See Paredes v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 528 F.3d 196 (3d Cir. 2008); Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 284 (5th Cir. 2007); United States v. Saenz-Gomez, 472 F.3d 791 (10th Cir. 2007); United States v. Garcia-Echaverria, 374 F.3d 440 (6th Cir. 2004); Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035 (7th Cir. 2004); Griffiths v. INS, 243 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2001).

At the time, there were other provisions of the Act that expressly included a requirement that a judgment be final, but Congress did not amend any of them. Compare former section 241(a)(2)(D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(D) (1994) (regarding the deportability of “[a]ny alien who at any time has been convicted (the judgment on such conviction becoming final)”), with section 237(a)(2)(D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(D) (2006) (same).

In stating that the respondent’s conviction should not be viewed as final, the dissent relies in part on Jimenez v. Quarterman, 129 S. Ct. 681, 686 (2009), where the Supreme Court determined that a Federal habeas corpus petitioner whose appeal was reinstated out of time through a State collateral attack, before he had first sought habeas relief, did not receive a final judgment until the conclusion of the direct appeal. However, in general, habeas corpus law is not analogous to immigration law. See Matter of Aguilar-Aquino, 24 I&N Dec. 747, 752-53 (BIA 2009) (finding that the definition of “custody” in habeas corpus proceedings does not govern immigration proceedings). First, the purpose of Federal habeas corpus proceedings is to provide convicted defendants an avenue to collaterally attack the validity of their convictions. See, e.g., Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227, 234 (1990). However, aliens may not contest the facts or merits of their convictions in immigration proceedings. Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992); Matter of McNaughton, 16 I&N Dec. 569, 571 (BIA 1978). In addition, under Federal habeas corpus law, a conviction is final only after direct discretionary review is complete. Jimenez v. Quarterman, supra, at 684-86. By contrast, the potential for discretionary review on direct appeal does not disturb the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Polanco, supra, at 896. Moreover, the Supreme Court in Jimenez applied “the most natural reading of the statutory text” of the Federal habeas statute. Jimenez v. Quarterman, supra, at 685. In this case, the language of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act clearly supports our conclusion regarding the finality of late-reinstated appeals for immigration purposes.

We note that the respondent’s motion to file a late appeal was contested by the State because of the length of the delay in filing the motion and the lack of adequate proof to support it.

7

These interests are especially prevalent in a case such as this, where the respondent waited until after he was ordered removed before even attempting to challenge the basis for his removal order and has provided no explanation for this delay. Cf. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 403 (BIA 1991) (noting that “we are not favorably disposed to the practice of waiting until the conclusion of the administrative appeal process to file a motion that seeks to offer additional evidence regarding the matter previously in issue”).

8

A pending collateral attack also does not disturb the finality of a conviction and therefore would not justify reopening of removal proceedings. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). If the respondent’s conviction is ultimately vacated, however, he would be able to seek reopening to the same extent as an alien with a vacated conviction resulting from a successful collateral attack. See Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378, 1380 (BIA 2000); cf. Saleh v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 17, 24-25 (2d Cir. 2007).

1

The dissent does not contend that the definition is incomplete, apart from its alleged failure to incorporate the concept of finality. The only apparent basis to do so is that the definition fails to state that a reversed conviction is not covered. Compare Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), where the Board noted that one court of appeals found the text of section 101(a)(48)(A) so clear as to compel a finding that even a conviction reversed on the merits remained a “conviction” for immigration purposes. However, the Board declined to adopt this interpretation, deeming it to be contrary to our precedent. Id. at 624 n.2; see also Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 61 n.5 (1980) (rejecting as “extreme” the argument that a reversed conviction remained a conviction for purposes of the statute punishing possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, but noting that the statute would apply where, as here, possession occurred while a conviction was pending on appeal). A well-recognized (indeed the sole) exception to the axiom that plain language in a statute must be followed is that doing so would lead to absurd or bizarre results. E.g., Demarest v. Manspeaker, supra. Thus, Congress is not obliged to negate absurd or bizarre consequences that flow from a literal application of the language it enacts, and accordingly its definition of a “conviction” in section 101(a)(48)(A) is not incomplete for its omission to provide that reversed convictions are not within its scope.

2

Although Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that preexisting interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change, Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978), that case and others like it are inapposite because we are not dealing with a reenactment of a statute by Congress. Rather, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, embodied an unequivocal break with the prior judicial and administrative requirement of finality of convictions in immigration proceedings in that it included, for the first time, a statutory definition of the term “conviction” under the Act.

3

Thus, in its conclusion, the dissenting opinion asserts that “[a]bsent clear statutory language to the contrary,” it would find that the “rule of finality in immigration law continues to apply.” Matter of Cardenas Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 823 (BIA 2009).

4

Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Servs., 511 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2007) (“IIRIRA did, however, eliminate the requirement that all direct appeals be exhausted or waived before a conviction is considered final under the statute.”).

5

See Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967 (2005).

6

Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 284 (5th Cir. 2007); United States v. Saenz-Gomez, 472 F.3d 791 (10th Cir. 2007); Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035 (7th Cir. 2004). I disagree with the dissent that these decisions should be discounted simply because they did not arise in the immigration context. To the contrary, a statutory provision that applies in multiple contexts must be interpreted consistently in all contexts. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 380 (2005) (noting that even when “constitutional concerns … are not present for aliens … who have not been admitted to the United States … it cannot justify giving the same detention provision a different meaning when such aliens are involved”); see also Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 11-12 n.8 (2004). Moreover, the dissent is mistaken in treating the above-cited decisions from the Fifth and Seventh circuits as nonholdings. See Matter of Cardenas Abreu, supra, at 819. A reading of the decisions belies this assertion. In both cases, the court decided the finality issue, even though another basis (not relied on) for reaching the result existed.

7

The dissent’s statement that the “Third and Sixth Circuits have found finality to be preserved,” Matter of Cardenas Abreu, supra, at 819, is a gross exaggeration, as in neither case was the statement more than dicta uttered in passing. Moreover, neither decision discussed or even cited the definition in section 101(a)(48) of the Act, in contrast to the considered dicta in Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Servs., supra. In addition, the dissent’s analogy to selected criminal recidivism provisions in which Congress elected to require finality of prior convictions does not demonstrate a generally accepted finality requirement because, as in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, Congress has elected not to include such a requirement in many other provisions in the criminal context that relate to prior offenses or convictions. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 228(c), 924(c), 1029(c), 1030(c), 2241(c), 2251(e), 2252(b) (2006).

8

For example, in a State that has no procedure for a late reinstatement of appeal, if a defendant were to succeed in a habeas corpus challenge based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim predicated on the failure of counsel to file an appeal as requested, the remedy, as with the late reinstatement statute in this case, would be to allow the defendant to take an appeal. But there is no pre-IIRIRA Board practice or precedent of which I am aware to support the notion that such a conviction lacks finality for immigration purposes, such that Congress should be deemed through incorporation of our practice or case law to have embodied such a result in section 101(a)(48) of the Act.

9

Moreover, Congress could factor in that even if DHS opted to bring removal proceedings based on an alien’s conviction in all situations where direct appeal was pending, it is unlikely that a great change would ensue in terms of the removal of aliens with such pending appeals. The time in which removal proceedings before Immigration Judges could be scheduled would ensure that many appeals would be decided before those proceedings concluded. When to such an interval is added the time for resolution of an alien’s appeal of right to the Board, during which no alien may be removed, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.6 (2008), the percentage of aliens with direct appeals remaining would be small indeed. Additionally, nothing compels the DHS to physically remove an alien who has been ordered removed while a direct appeal of a conviction bearing on removability remains unresolved.

10

I note that myriad other policy choices are available, apart from the all or nothing ones of either requiring finality or not in every circumstance. For example, Congress might reasonably opt to require finality for removability determinations, but not for purposes of bars to eligibility for relief based on a conviction. Congress could also, if it deemed public safety considerations to so warrant, require finality only for convictions involving nonviolent crimes, or it could designate particular offenses or types of offenses, such as those involving national security or sexual misconduct, as not requiring finality.

11

Should further review by the Attorney General take place, see 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(g), (h) (2008), I note that if the respondent’s conviction were to be affirmed in the interim, this would not moot the case because of the doctrine of “capable of repetition yet evading review.” E.g., Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318-23 (1988). Moreover, the Board and the Attorney General are not constrained by the “case or controversy” requirements of Article III of the Constitution. See Matter of Luis, 22 I&N Dec. 747, 753 (BIA 1999).

1

See, e.g., Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018 (5th Cir. 1990) (holding that the Texas deferred adjudication procedure, which provided for further proceedings on the issue of guilt before entering judgment, did not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes), superseded by statute as stated in Moosa v. INS, 171 F.3d 994 (5th Cir. 1999); cf. Yanez-Popp v. U.S. INS, 998 F.2d 231 (4th Cir. 1993) (finding that a grant of “probation without judgment” under Maryland law, during which time the court had the power to enter a judgment or adjudication of guilt without further proceedings upon a violation of probation, met the Ozkok standard for conviction).

2

The statutory definition of a conviction at section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act provides:
The term “conviction” means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where—
(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and
(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed.

3

See, e.g., Wilson v. INS, 43 F.3d 211 (5th Cir. 1995); Yanez-Popp v. INS, supra; Molina v. INS, 981 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1992); Chong v. INS, 890 F.2d 284 (11th Cir. 1989).

4

See, e.g., Alim v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 1239, 1249 (11th Cir. 2006) (“As we read § 1101(a)(48)(A), Congress did not address the effect to be given a conviction or nolo contondere [sic] plea that is subsequently vacated because of a defect in the underlying criminal proceeding.”).

5

As discussed, our Roldanl/Rodriguez-Ruiz/Pickering approach relied on analysis beyond the plain words contained in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. Similarly, in Matter of Eslamizar, 23 I&N Dec. 684, 686, 688 (BIA 2004), we looked beyond the “literal reading of the conviction definition” to examine congressional intent to leave “the normal and traditional meaning of a judgment” intact.

6

See, e.g., Alim v. Gonzales, supra; Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193 (3d Cir. 2005); Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2005); Ali v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 722 (7th Cir. 2005); Ikenokwalu-White v. INS, 316 F.3d 798 (8th Cir. 2003).

7

See Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, 322 F.3d 804, 812 (5th Cir. 2002) (finding a conviction to remain a valid basis for removal despite being vacated or expunged for other than immigration purposes); cf Discipio v. Ashcroft, 417 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2005) (observing that no other circuit disagrees with Pickering, but declining to revisit the panel decision in Renteria-Gonzalez absent en banc intervention), vacating 369 F.3d 472 (5th Cir. 2004).

8

If an alien’s criminal conviction were ultimately overturned on direct appeal, the conviction would no longer support a charge of removability. Removal of the individual pending direct appellate review would lead to serious consequences should the conviction be reversed. See, e.g., Staples v. United States, supra, at 616 (observing that a potentially harsh penalty supports reading the statute to encompass a traditional mens rea requirement not included in statutory language). If the conviction is ultimately overturned after removal has occurred, the respondent cannot seek reopening of the removal proceedings. Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008) (construing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) (2008) to mean that the Board and immigration courts lack jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings of aliens who have been removed). Consequently, the majority opinion’s observation regarding the potential availability of a motion to reopen after a conviction has actually been vacated does not assist an alien who already has been removed.

9

In Staples v. United States, supra, the Court determined that the “substantial body of precedent” on the question whether Congress intended to dispense with a conventional mens rea element provided so helpful an interpretive tool that it was not even necessary to rely on the rule of lenity, under which an ambiguous criminal statute is to be construed in favor of the accused. Id. at 619 n.17; see also INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 320 (2001); INS v. Errico, 385 U.S. 214, 225 (1966) (“‘[S]ince the stakes are considerable for the individual [charged with deportability], we will not assume that Congress meant to trench on his freedom beyond that which is required by the narrowest of several possible meanings of the words used.”’ (quoting Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.S. 6, 10 (1948))).

10

Griffiths involves the same “on file” procedure at issue in Pino v. Landon, supra, that “‘suspend[ed] the adjudicative process, including the defendant’s right to appeal, until such time as the court reactivates or makes some further disposition of the case.”’ Griffiths v. INS, supra, at 51 (quoting White v. INS, 17 F.3d 475, 479 (1st Cir. 1994)). Pino did not provide a rationale for concluding that the Massachusetts “on file” procedure failed to meet the finality requirement and did not set forth a finality standard. As discussed, extensive case law came to consensus in defining finality for immigration purposes, culminating in the Ozkok standard. Under the third prong in Ozkok, the Pino/Griffiths “on file” procedure would not equate to a conviction because it constitutes a deferred adjudication that could allow for further proceedings on guilt or innocence in the future. Today, under the section 101(a)(48)(A) statutory definition, an attenuated possibility of obtaining appellate review for a deferred adjudication has been specifically defined as not detracting from the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes. Matter of Punu, supra.

11

The Pauley concurrence argues that the regulatory requirement at 8 C.F.R. § 1238.1(b)(1)(iii) (2008) that convictions be final to support an order of expedited removal supports reading section 101(a)(48)(A) as not including finality. However, the regulation contained the exact same finality requirement prior to enactment of section 101 (a)(48)(A). 8 C.F.R. § 242.25(b)(1)(iii) (1996). Further, regulatory emphasis on finality in the expedited removal context, where removal occurs quickly without proceedings before an Immigration Judge, does not undermine its vitality in adversarial removal proceedings.

12

Deferred adjudication, also known as a “deferred judgment,” is defined as a “judgment placing a convicted defendant on probation, the successful completion of which will prevent entry of the underlying judgment of conviction.” Black’s Law Dictionary 454, 859 (8th ed. 2004).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pius Joseph, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; cancellation of removal for non-lawful permanent residents under section 240A(b); voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appealed from a decision of an Immigration Judge dated June 17, 2008, which found the respondent subject to removal as charged and denied the respondent’s requests for adjustment of status, cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § I229b(b), and for voluntary departure and ordered him removed.¿FN1º
 
The respondent has a criminal conviction under California Health and Safety Code § 11550(a) for use/under the influence of a controlled substance. The Immigration Judge, based on that criminal conviction found that the respondent was subject to removal and inadmissibility under section 237(a)(2)(B) of the Act and section 212(a)(2)(A)(II) of the Act. On such basis the Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for adjustment of status and for cancellation of removal for nonpermanent residents. On appeal the respondent asserts that he has filed a motion to vacate the drug conviction, alleging that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his plea and he requests that his case be remanded. He also asserts that this conviction is within the scope of Federal First Offender Act¿FN2º and alleges that such conviction would have been expunged except that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We find that the factual findings of the Immigration Judge are not clearly erroneous, and we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s thorough decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874(BIA 1994); see generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). It is not evident that the respondent’s drug conviction is within the scope of the 18 U.S.C. § 3607 because that statute involves simple possession while the respondent’s conviction was for use/being under the influence of a controlled substance. He asserts that he received deficient performance of counsel in the criminal proceeding but he has presented no evidence on this issue and we therefore find no merit in it. See Matter of Compean, Burgaly, and J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). He also maintains that his conviction is not a final one for immigration purposes because he has petitioned to vacate such conviction. The respondent’s conviction remains final for immigration purposes in the absence of a showing that such conviction has been vacated. See Matter of Marroquin, 23 I&N Dec. 705 (A.G. 2005).
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge in a decision dated October 15, 2004, found the respondent subject to removal, denied the respondent’s requests for adjustment of status, cancellation of removal and for voluntary departure and ordered him removed. The respondent appealed from that decision. In a decision dated December 30, 2005, the Board remanded proceedings for further consideration.

(2) has not previously been the subject of a disposition under this subsection; the court may … place him on probation for a term of not more than one year without entering a judgment of conviction. At any time before the expiration of the term of probation, if the person has not violated a condition of his probation, the court may, without entering a judgment of conviction, dismiss the proceedings against the person and discharge him from probation. At the expiration of the term of probation, if the person has not violated a condition of his probation, the court shall, without entering a judgment of conviction, dismiss the proceedings against the person and discharge him from probation ….

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew L. Friedman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sari N. Maltz
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 On December 20, 2002, the Board sustained an appeal of the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), and reversed an Immigration Judge’s termination of proceedings. The Immigration Judge on November 2, 2004, declined to again terminate proceedings, and found that no relief from deportation was sought. The Board affirmed this decision on June 20, 2006. The Board denied a motion to reopen, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, on October 15,2007. The respondent filed a late and numerically-barred motion to reopen on December 10, 2008. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The DHS opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent, who is from the Dominican Republic, argues that his former attorneys did not adequately represent him, in either seeking termination of proceedings, or pursuing relief under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision setting forth standards for claims involving (what was formerly known as) ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaty & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (Matter of Compean). The United States Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Compean first found that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. Id. at 716-727. As to whether reopening is appropriate under the Board’s “broad discretion”, Matter of Compean, supra, at 728, the Attorney General set forth a “general framework” that the Board is to apply. Id. at 730. The Attorney General announced several substantive standards for evaluating such claims, now known as “deficient performance of counsel” claims, as well as evidentiary standards for such claims. Id. at 730-39.¿FN1º
 
The respondent’s deficient performance of counsel claim does not warrant reopening of these proceedings. The respondent fails to meet his burden of establishing the first substantive element necessary to establish a deficient performance of counsel claim, as announced in Matter of Compean. That is, the respondent fails to show that counsel’s alleged failings were “egregious.” Matter of Compean, supra, at 732. The Attorney General acknowledged that this requirement was recognized by the Board under its prior case law. Matter of Compean, supra, at 732. Indeed, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has also recognized this standard. Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008)(“¿tºhe BIA properly determined that Jiang did not make a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not establish that his prior counsel’s handling of the case was so egregious that his hearing was rendered unfair”).
 
*2 The respondent was admitted for lawful temporary residence, under the Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) program, on September 9, 1988 (Board’s Oct. 15, 2007, dec. at 1). On July 25, 1989, he was convicted of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance. Id On December 1, 1990, his status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident. The respondent argues that prior counsel should have argued that he was either not subject to deportation, or eligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, on a theory that his admissibility to the United States should be calculated based on the date he was admitted for lawful temporary residence, under the SAW program. Yet the principal decision relied upon for this theory, Perez-Enriquez v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 1007 (9th Cir. 2006)(en banc)(holding that an alien’s admissibility under the SAW program is determined at the time of his adjustment to a temporary resident and that his status is thereafter automatically adjusted to a lawful permanent resident without further inquiry into admissibility) was decided after the Board’s June 20, 2006, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal.¿FN2º The Board cannot find former counsel’s actions in this case to have been “egregious”, based on not advancing an argument that has apparently not been adopted by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and was the subject of vigorous dissent even when decided en banc by the Ninth Circuit after the Board’s final decision in this case.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of deportation is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Henry Zhang, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On February 11, 1999, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ordered him removed in absentia to China, pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). On August 10, 1999, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied on August 30, 1999. On August 17, 2007, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel of one of his four attorneys. The Immigration Judge denied this motion to reopen, and the respondent appealed.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen, filed within 180 days, which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(h); see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). Only one such motion may be filed pursuant to this regulation. As such, the respondent’s second motion to reopen his in absentia order is time and number-barred, and subject to no exception to the timely filing requirement. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(h).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arose, has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the time limitations for motions to reopen during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing his motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002). The respondent’s appeal from the denial of the motion to reopen is based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The requirements for establishing a claim of deficient performance of counsel are set forth in Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (hereinafter “Matter of Compean”). Cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (stating requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), superseded. An alien who seeks to reopen his removal proceedings based on deficient performance of counsel bears the burden of establishing (i) that his lawyer’s failings were egregious; (ii) that in cases where the alien moves to reopen beyond the applicable time limit, he exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to cure his lawyer’s alleged deficient performance; and (iii) that he suffered prejudice from the lawyer’s errors, namely, that but for the deficient performance, it is more likely than not that the alien would have been entitled to the ultimate relief he was seeking. Matter of Compean, supra. We find the respondent has not substantially met the procedural requirements for a deficient performance of counsel claim under the procedures set forth in Matter of Compean, supra; see also Matter of Lozada, supra.¿FN1º
 
*2 The respondent has been in proceedings since 1998, and should have been aware of any possible deficient performance in approximately August 10, 1999, when he filed his first motion to reopen. In his first motion, the respondent claims he decided to move to Philadelphia as opposed to Guam, the venue of his immigration case (Respondent’s 1999 Motion at 1-2). His counsel in Guam was notified of his upcoming immigration hearing, and the respondent was aware of his hearing date on February 12, 1999 (Affidavit at 1). The respondent’s Guam counsel appeared on his hearing date but, the respondent chose not appear (Respondent’s 1999 Motion at Exh. C). The respondent was in the process of hiring new counsel in Philadelphia, and claims to have relied on her poor advice instructing him that he did not have to attend the hearing in Guam (Respondent’s 1999 Motion at 2). In his second motion to reopen, the respondent essentially alleges the same circumstances (Respondent’s 2007 Motion at 5).
 
The respondent’s first motion was denied by the Immigration Judge on August 20, 1999, and was not appealed. The second motion to reopen was filed before the Immigration Judge on August 17, 2007, almost 8 years after the final administrative decision. The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). Moreover, we do not find that the respondent has shown that he acted with due diligence in discovering the alleged error of his prior attorney. Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1095-97 (9th Cir. 2007) (requiring due diligence for equitable tolling). And, the respondent has not explained why he failed to file a motion to reopen within a reasonable time after his discovery of the alleged deficient performance as to allow for equitable tolling of the statute. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
Additionally, the movant must establish that he suffered prejudice because of his attorneys’ actions or failure to act. See Matter of Compean, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra at 638. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding alien must show the outcome might have been affected had the negligent representation not occurred). We do not find that the respondent has provided persuasive evidence of prejudice arising from his counsel’s allegedly deficient performance, i.e., evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that but for the allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel he would have been granted asylum or withholding of removal. Further, the respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence demonstrating he has met his burden of proving that he will ultimately prevail on his request for relief. See Matter of Compean, supra, at 733-35 (to prevail on a deficient performance of counsel claim, the alien must demonstrate that, but for the deficient performance of counsel, it is more likely than not that he would have prevailed in his quest to remain in the United States).
 
*3 Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s ultimate determination that the respondent has not met the standards for establishing deficient performance of counsel. Matter ofCompean, supra. In light of the respondent’s failure to show sufficient prejudice arising from the alleged deficient performance of counsel, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (finding that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if his motion to reopen were granted it would likely change the result in his case); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(ii).
 
The following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We have considered that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). However, this is not such a case, particularly when the respondent concedes he had notice of his hearing, and has not explained his lack of diligence for almost 8 years.

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **
 
U.S. Department of Justice
Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ARTURO MAURICIO RODRIGUEZ-BRITO
File: A031 312 326 - New York, NY
April 21, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David W. Guy, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(m)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
This case was last before the Board on February 18, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s February 14, 2003, decision denying his application for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2007, decision denying his motion to reopen his proceedings predicated upon his current claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In his decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion first for failure to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in that he failed to provide evidence that he properly notified former counsel of his complaint(s) and failed to provide evidence that he filed a complaint (I.J. at 2). Alternatively, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent otherwise failed to meet his burden in establishing he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 2). However, we point out that the respondent was required to file his motion with the Board and the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the motion inasmuch as the Board issued the final administrative decision on the merits in this case on February 18, 2005. See 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(a) (2008) (“A request to reopen… any case in which a decision has been made by the Board… must be in the form of a written motion to the Board”); see also Matter of Mladineo, I4I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974) (Immigration Judge retainsjunsdiction over motions to reopen where Board dismisses appeal solely for lack of jurisdiction, without adjudication on the merits, and where no appeal is taken from his or her prior order); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
