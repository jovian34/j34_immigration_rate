APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew J. Mahon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Keith Hoppes
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Removability; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s November 21, 2016, decision. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a response to the motion and does not oppose remanding the case to the Immigration Judge. The motion to remand will be granted and the record will be returned to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings with regard to credibility and the likelihood of future events, to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Huang v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 620 F.3d 372, 382-87 (3d Cir. 2010); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and any other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was charged with removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), due to his April 9, 2015, conviction for possession of a controlled substance, to wit, synthetic marijuana, in violation of Title 35 of the Pennsylvania Statute, section 780-113(a)(16) (I.J. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged.
 
The respondent has filed a motion to remand based on the February 6, 2017, decision of the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas to vacate and dismiss the respondent’s conviction of possession of synthetic marijuana on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent included a copy of the court’s decision with his motion. In its response to the respondent’s motion, the DHS states that it does not oppose the motion. Based on the foregoing, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the new evidence in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (holding that motions to remand are subject to the same substantive requirements as motions to reopen); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing). The Immigration Judge should consider the new evidence and enter a new decision in this case.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack E. Wallace, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher Santora
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on August 19, 2016, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 25, 2015, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States to Mexico. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, on November 16, 2016, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
Due to the issues raised in this motion, we will set forth the procedural history of the case. The respondent was served with a Notice to Appear on April 8, 2013, alleging, inter alia, that the respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico (Exh. 1). The DHS thereafter filed a Form I-213 and a Mexican Consular ID card with the respondent’s name and purported photo. The Form I-213 indicates that the respondent “is a citizen and national of Mexico by virtue of birth on June 28, 1986.” On March 24, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to suppress these documents before the Immigration Judge. Therein, he argued, inter alia, that the DHS’ Form I-213 and ID evidence arose from an illegal arrest, and he sought to terminate proceedings. However, the respondent attached a declaration to his motion which admitted that he was “born in San Geronimo de los Dolores, Mexico, on June 28, 1986.” Thereafter, on April 7, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to retract this declaration, and to substitute a similar declaration without the respondent’s admission of alienage.
 
In a decision dated May 20, 2014, the Immigration Judge found “no just cause” to grant the motion to retract and substitute the respondent’s declarations, and, relying on the respondent’s declaration of alienage, he found the motion to suppress moot (May 20, 2014, I.J. Dec. at 2). The Immigration Judge then shifted the burden to the respondent, under section 291 of the Act, to establish time, place, and manner of entry. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c). In a pleading dated January 16, 2015, the respondent did not deny his alienage, but also declined to offer evidence on the time, place or manner of his entry. The Immigration Judge ultimately found, in a decision dated February 25, 2015, that the respondent had conceded his alienage and that he had not demonstrated that he had any lawful status in the United States (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 2-3). Inasmuch as the respondent also did not seek relief from removal, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 3). On August 19, 2016, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal, finding that the respondent had not demonstrated an exception to the general rule set forth in Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986), in which we held that an alien’s lawyer’s admissions in immigration proceedings are binding absent “egregious circumstances.”
 
*2 The respondent subsequently filed this ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In support of his motion, the respondent has complied with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 18 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, he argues that the admission of alienage was not a tactical decision, but rather a material “mistake” evidenced by the fact that the basis of his entire motion to suppress involved the suppression of his alienage. He lastly argues that he suffered prejudice due to this mistake because he would have likely had his motion to suppress granted and his proceedings terminated.
 
We disagree. The respondent has cited various cases in which courts have found that nonstrategic admissions of counsel constitute deficient performance. See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 166 (5th Cir. 2006) (“the effect of admitting the false claim of citizenship charge was to cut off all available avenues of relief”); Hinton v. State, 854 So.2d 254 (Fla.Dist.Ct App. 2003) (finding that when counsel concedes guilt to a charged offense without client’s consent, counsel is presumed ineffective); Nixon v. Singletary, 758 So.2d 618 (Fla. 2000) (holding that counsel’s concession of guilt without defendant’s consent during opening and closing is per se ineffective); Salazar-Gonzalez v. Lynch, 798 F.3d 917 (9th Cir. 2015) (failure to file appeal was not tactical); Benitez-Saldana v. State, 67 So.3d 320 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2011) (where counsel’s factual concessions during opening before jury resulted in conviction, representation was presumed ineffective). We find these cases inapposite to the respondent’s case because they either involve issues in criminal court, or they involve tactical legal issues rather than factual admissions, or both.1 Too many differences in representational rights and standards exist between jury trials in criminal proceedings and the respondent’s immigration proceedings to find these cases persuasive.
 
As such, we find no reason to disturb our previous finding that “no unreasonable professional judgment was involved in the respondent’s admission” (Bd. Dec. at 2). Moreover, we do not find that the respondent has demonstrated the necessary prejudice under Matter of Lozada, supra. While the respondent states, in a conclusory manner, that there is a “reasonable likelihood that the outcome of (the respondent’s) case would have been different” without the concession of alienage, we find this assumption speculative. As we previously noted, neither party has alleged that the respondent’s declaration of alienage is untrue, and insufficient evidence exists to reason that the Immigration Judge might have terminated the respondent’s proceedings absent his admission of alienage. In so finding, we note that the respondent did not proffer evidence once the burden shifted to him to demonstrate the time, place and manner of his entry (Bd. Dec. at 1; Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c). As such, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion is denied.

Moreover, while the ineffective assistance found in Benitez and Nixon, supra, involved factual concessions, the circumstances involved statements before a jury which were construed as a guilty plea in criminal proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven K. Wichmer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kimberly A. Burgess
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on October 31, 2016, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a decision pursuant to Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). Previously, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeared before an Immigration Judge on September 22, 2015, and agreed to voluntarily depart the United States by January 20, 2016. On December 21, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen which the Immigration Judge denied in an order dated January 21, 2016, from which the respondent appealed. The Immigration Judge prepared a written decision, dated November 22, 2016, and has certified the record back to the Board. The decision of the Immigration Judge will be affirmed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In his appellate brief, the respondent argues that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as his former counsel allegedly did not advise him of the availability of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (Convention) (Resp. Brief at 4-9). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). However, there is no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s former counsel advised him of the availability of those forms of relief and protection from removal.
 
The record contains a January 12, 2016, letter from the respondent’s former counsel. Therein, counsel states that he discussed with the respondent on November 10, 2014, January 27, 2015, and September 2015, several forms of relief from removal, including whether the respondent fears persecution in Mexico (Letter at 3). According to the letter, the respondent stated that he did not fear persecution in Mexico. Counsel states that he then determined that the respondent did not have a bona fide claim to asylum, and that voluntary departure was his only viable form of relief from removal. In addition, the record contains a September 22, 2015, notice signed by the respondent in which he affirmed that he would not request asylum and understood his obligation to voluntarily depart the United States. The respondent has also not provided sufficient evidence establishing that there is a reasonable possibility that he would be granted relief or protection from removal at a reopened hearing (I.J. at 3). Hence, the respondent has not established that the advice that he received from his former counsel was incorrect. In light of the foregoing, there is no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent knowingly waived his opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention. It follows that the respondent has not established that he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying reopening of these proceedings based on the respondent’s submission of previously unavailable material evidence, specifically his Form I-589 application for asylum (Resp. Brief at 9-10). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (providing that a motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). However, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent previously waived the opportunity to file the application, and furthermore, that the proffered application did not present a viable claim for relief.
 
Moreover, the respondent argues on appeal that he established an exceptional situation to reopen these proceedings sua sponte (Resp. Brief at 10). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). He states that he has resided in the United States for a lengthy period, has maintained gainful employment, has a citizen son, and he is afraid to return to Mexico. However, the respondent waived his opportunity to apply for relief from removal at the hearing. Hence, we decline to reopen these proceedings sua sponte.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2016, decision.1 In that decision, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. The record will be remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to appeal when his prior counsel accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure on his behalf. Specifically, the respondent alleges that his prior counsel failed to advise him of his eligibility for adjustment of status.
 
We conclude that remand of the record is warranted. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge never raised the issue of appeal or discussed on the record that the respondent would be waiving his right to appeal by accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure (Tr. at 58-61). See Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (holding that voluntary departure cannot be granted prior to the conclusion of removal proceedings without an express waiver of the right to appeal by the alien or the alien’s representative); see also section 240(c)(5) of the Act (stating that “[i]f the immigration judge decides that the alien is removable and orders the alien to be removed, the judge shall inform the alien of the right to appeal that decision . . . .”). Since the respondent never expressly waived his right to appeal, we conclude that remand of the record is warranted for the Immigration Judge to reassess the respondent’s eligibility for relief. Because we conclude that remand of the record is necessary based on the aforementioned grounds, we need not address whether the respondent established that remand of the record is warranted because his prior counsel engaged in ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2016, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

Brandi M. Lohr
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 7, 2016, decision granting him voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) requests that we summarily affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings with regard to credibility and the likelihood of future events, to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, 677 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2012) (holding that a determination of what will occur in the future and the degree of likelihood of the occurrence is a finding of fact subject only to clear error review); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and any other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On March 7, 2016, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure and required that he depart the United States by April 6, 2016. On appeal, the respondent claims that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision (Respondent’s Brief at 4). However, his attorney during proceedings before the Immigration Judge expressly waived his right to appeal (Tr. at 22). The respondent claims on appeal that he has never received advice on voluntary departure (Respondent’s Brief at 9). He also claims that if he had known what voluntary departure was, he would have not taken it because it was never his intention to leave the United States (Respondent’s Brief at 9).1 However, the record reveals that the respondent repeatedly testified that he understood he must leave the United States within 30 days, Tr. at 45-47.
 
The respondent was represented by counsel below and the request for voluntary departure and the waiver of appeal made by counsel are binding on the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal concession made by counsel is binding on the alien); see also Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that facts admitted by a party are “judicial admissions” that bind that party throughout the litigation).
 
*2 Furthermore, to the extent the respondent attributes his lack of knowledge about voluntary departure to his prior counsel, who represented him before the Immigration Judge, the respondent has not meaningfully set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In particular, while we recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit only requires substantial compliance to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), the respondent has not established that he substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. See Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005).2
 
Inasmuch as the respondent’s attorney expressly waived appeal, the conditions for granting pre-conclusion voluntary departure have been met. See section 240B(a) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (holding that pre-conclusion voluntary departure may not be granted prior to the completion of removal proceedings without an express waiver of the right to appeal).3 Therefore, the respondent is not permitted to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to this Board. Accordingly, we find that this case is not properly before us. The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993).4
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
Roger Pauley
FOR THE BOARD

However, at the hearing, the respondent testified before the Immigration Judge that if the Immigration Judge granted him voluntary departure he had the funds to depart and was willing to do so (Tr. at 29).

2

In order to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must submit the following: (1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the former counsel was notified of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien has filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel’s conduct and, if not, an explanation for not doing so. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.

3

The respondent claims in his Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge erred by not giving him voluntary departure of 120 days. However, he does not pursue this argument in his brief on appeal. Furthermore, the statute regarding pre-conclusion voluntary departure does not require that the Immigration Judge grant 120 days of voluntary departure. Rather, section 240B(a)(2)(A) of the Act provides that permission to depart voluntarily shall not be valid for a period exceeding 120 days.

4

Therefore, we need not consider the respondent’s request for administrative closure for DHS to consider his request for prosecutorial discretion. Similarly, we cannot consider the respondent’s request for remand. Furthermore, prosecutorial discretion is not within the purview of the Board or Immigration Judge.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James A. Jones
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 6, 2016, denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including questions of law and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent entered the United States as an unaccompanied minor at age 16, and was served with a Notice to Appear shortly thereafter on September 12, 2014. After appearing pro se at her initial hearing, the respondent appeared with prior counsel, Mr. George Miller, at subsequent master calendar hearings. After her former counsel determined that the respondent was ineligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), he stated that the respondent wished to receive an order of removal. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed on July 21, 2015. On June 8, 2016, the respondent, who was still represented by Mr. Miller, filed an untimely motion to reopen, arguing that due to a change in law, the respondent was eligible for SIJS, and also that the respondent had a fear of returning to El Salvador and had filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on June 9, 2016, noting that the motion was untimely and determining that it did not meet the standards for sua sponte reopening. The respondent did not appeal this decision.
 
On August 31, 2016, through new counsel, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen, alleging that proceedings should be reopened due to her prior attorney’s ineffective assistance. Specifically, the respondent argues that prior counsel was unprepared for hearings, failed to inquire into her fear of returning to El Salvador or file an application for relief based on this fear, was unaware of the appropriate jurisdiction in which to file such an application, failed to appeal the Immigration Judge’s removal order, failed to raise arguments to overcome the untimeliness of the June 8 motion to reopen, and failed to appeal the denial of this motion. In support of her motion, she attached, among other evidence, her own and her mother’s statements regarding Mr. Miller’s alleged ineffective assistance, a letter informing Mr. Miller of the allegations against him, a complaint with the state bar association regarding Mr. Miller’s performance, and a declaration containing Mr. Miller’s response to these allegations. The respondent acknowledged that her motion was both untimely and her second such motion, but urged that the time and numerical limitations of section 240(c)(7)(A) and (c)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (c)(i), be equitably tolled given prior counsel’s ineffective assistance and her own diligence in discovering the ineffective assistance and filing her motion. See Kuusk v. Holder, 732 F.3d 302, 305-06 (4th Cir. 2013) (recognizing that the principles of equitable tolling apply to untimely motions to reopen removal proceedings).
 
*2 On September 6, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that it was numerically barred, and again finding that it did not meet the standards for sua sponte reopening. The respondent has timely appealed from that decision.
 
As a threshold matter, we find that the Board has jurisdiction over this matter even though the respondent’s appeal brief reflects that she may no longer be physically present in the United States. See Williams v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 329, 332-34 (4th Cir. 2007) (invalidating 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), the regulation treating an alien’s removal from the United States after filing a motion to reopen as withdrawal of the motion); Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646, 660 (BIA 2008) (acknowledging that the Board will apply the holding in Williams v. Gonzales to cases arising in the Fourth Circuit).
 
The Immigration Judge’s brief decision did not adequately address the issues raised by the respondent in her motion to reopen. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (holding that the Immigration Judge’s decision must identify and fully explain the reasons for denial of a motion to reopen proceedings). In particular, the Immigration Judge’s decision does not contain any findings of fact or analysis regarding the respondent’s claim that her prior counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel such that the numerical and time limits on motions to reopen are subject to equitable tolling in her case. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (finding that because the Board’s fact finding ability on appeal is limited, it is important for Immigration Judges to include in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law). We therefore find that the Immigration Judge’s decision is insufficient for our review, and will remand for further consideration of the motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further consideration of the motion to reopen consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher John Stender, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; administrative closure; voluntary departure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s March 28, 2016, decision denying his motion to continue and alternative motion to administratively close proceedings. The respondent also moves for a remand. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by denying his motion for continuance. We disagree. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent asserted this reason for his request for a continuance: that he was dissatisfied with prior counsel and so he wanted a new lawyer to advise him of any available defenses and relief from removal, and have time to make a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request (I.J. at 2-3; Resp. Motion to Continue). An Immigration Judge “may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. The respondent has not established that “good cause” existed to further continue these removal proceedings. See id; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that a continuance should not be granted where it is being sought “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the continuance denial, as he has not shown that he is eligible for any other forms of relief from removal or that any FOIA request made during the pendency of this appeal resulted in a material discovery. See Cinapian v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1067, 1074-75 (9th Cir. 2009). On appeal, the respondent adds that a continuance was necessary to obtain evidence to support his request for prosecutorial discretion from the DHS. However, the respondent did not present this as a basis for the continuance, and moreover, neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982). The respondent also states that a continuance would have helped him obtain evidence to support his motion for administrative closure (resp. Br. at 7-8). However, it is not clear how he would have shown that he warranted administrative closure with no form of relief available to him. In addition, during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent has not submitted any evidence of his DUI conviction being vacated. Therefore, the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny him a continuance was in error or that he experienced prejudice as a result. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983) (noting that an alien must show that the denial of the continuance caused actual prejudice).
 
*2 We agree with the respondent that it appears the Immigration Judge implicitly denied his motion for administrative closure. The Immigration Judge acknowledged the motion in his decision, but ultimately, it is not clear if he explicitly denied the motion (I.J. at 2, 4). Accordingly, the respondent moves for a remand for the Immigration Judge to explicitly adjudicate the motion.1 However, because we have de novo review authority over discretionary issues, such as the motion at issue, we deem it unnecessary to remand to the Immigration Judge for adjudication of the motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). In addition, our consideration of the motion relies on no new findings of fact. The respondent has not shown that he warrants administrative closure of these proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012) (outlining factors for evaluating whether administrative closure is warranted, including the likelihood of success on any underlying requests for relief).2 We observe that administrative closure is used to temporarily remove a case from an Immigration Judge’s active calendar or from the Board’s docket. See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 480 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 692. The administrative closure of a case does not result in a final order. It is merely an administrative convenience that allows cases to be removed from the calendar in appropriate situations, subject to being recalendared at a later date. See Matter of Amico, 19 I&N Dec. 652, 654 n.1 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent sought administrative closure to seek prosecutorial discretion from the DHS (Resp. Mot. To Administratively Close Proceedings). However, while the respondent argues that he may have been eligible for prosecutorial discretion, as noted above, the DHS has sole authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this matter. See Matter of Quintero, supra. In addition, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent had no apparent relief available to him other than voluntary departure (I.J. at 2). The DHS did not state whether it opposed administrative closure in this case, and it is unknown if the DHS had declined to exercise prosecutorial discretion or has since issued a formal decision on any such request in this matter. Accordingly, we have considered: the reasons for which the respondent sought administrative closure; the unlikelihood that the respondent would succeed on any petition, application, or other action he was pursuing outside of removal proceedings; and the lack of showing that administrative closure would affect the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. Id. at 695. Based on the foregoing and our de novo review of the matter, the discretionary benefit of administrative closure would not have been appropriate in this case. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (once the DHS institutes proceedings, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge); Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 696. Accordingly, we will deny the respondent’s motion to remand for the Immigration Judge to adjudicate his motion for administrative closure. See, e.g., de Jesus Melendez v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 1019, 1023 n.1 (9th Cir. 2007) (futile remands are not required).
 
*3 Finally, to the extent the respondent asserts that his due process rights were violated in the proceedings below, we are unpersuaded. See Cruz Rendon v. Holder, 603 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that in order to prevail on a due process claim that she was denied a full and fair removal hearing, an alien must demonstrate that the challenged proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case; and that she suffered prejudice, such that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation). The respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice such that the outcome of these proceedings may have been affected by the Immigration Judge’s decision, including the absence of an explicit adjudication of his motion for administrative closure.
 
Moreover, in reference to the respondent’s contentions regarding his former counsel(s), the respondent has also not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or demonstrated that he suffered resultant prejudice. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Additionally, because the respondent has not shown that, but for his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, he would have obtained post-conviction relief and been eligible for any other form of relief, i.e., besides voluntary departure, he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. Thus, overall, we conclude that remanded proceedings are not warranted on this basis.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is denied
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
*4 WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if she provides to the DHS such evidence of her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

We note that the respondent has not filed a motion for administrative closure before the Board.

In Matter of Avetisyan, the Board held that, in determining whether administrative closure of proceedings is appropriate, an Immigration Judge or the Board should weigh all the relevant factors presented in the case. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the reason administrative closure is sought; (2) the basis for any opposition to administrative closure; (3) the likelihood the respondent will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he or she is pursuing outside of removal proceedings; (4) the anticipated duration of the closure; (5) the responsibility of either party, if any, in contributing to any current or anticipated delay; and (6) the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings (for example, termination of the proceedings or entry of a removal order) when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board. Id. at 695.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bennett Grossman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s May 7, 2013 decision dismissing her untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. Any motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must be filed within 30 days after the date of that decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B). The record reflects that the Board did not receive the motion until January 18, 2017. The motion to reconsider was therefore filed untimely.
 
We also find that the motion does not assert any error of fact or law in the Board’s decision, or argument that was overlooked, but rather seeks to raise additional arguments with regard to the respondents’ removal proceedings and applications for relief. Those issues should have been raised below or on appeal. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006), at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied” and “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”). The respondent argues that she is not removable as charged in the Notice to Appear, specifically that her Grand Theft conviction is neither an aggravated felony nor a crime involving moral turpitude. First, the respondent was only charged with removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act for being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within 5 years of admission. Moreover, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, denied her application for relief, but granted her pre-conclusion voluntary departure. Pursuant to that grant, the respondent waived her right to appeal. As we stated in our prior decisions, the respondent was represented by counsel and has not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, the respondent’s disagreement with our decision is not a basis for reconsideration.
 
We acknowledge the letters of support submitted with the present motion, but they do not establish extraordinary circumstances warranting a sua sponte grant of this untimely motion. For these reasons, the motion fails to meet the regulatory requirements and we see no reason to reconsider the matter sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marsha W. Mignott, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carol D. Riley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted conditional lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s order dated December 6, 2016. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ordered him removed based on his criminal conviction and termination of his conditional lawful permanent resident status.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
At the hearing, the respondent requested a continuance of proceedings to enable him to pursue post-conviction relief with regard to the 2010 conviction that serves as a basis for removal and renders him ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent alleged that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of this conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it (Tr. at 23).2 The Immigration Judge denied the requested continuance (I.J. at 23). On appeal, the respondent challenges denial of the continuance. However, the respondent does not indicate that the conviction has been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. __, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karla L. Kraus, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J.L. Woodmansee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 4, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his request for a continuance but granting him the privilege of voluntary departure. On October 12, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§ 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The respondent, however, has submitted sufficient evidence to establish that equitable tolling of the filing deadline is warranted in his case. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that equitable tolling of the time limit for a motion to reopen is available “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”). The respondent also has satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, the respondent has established that he was prejudiced by the errors of his prior attorney. See Matter of Lozada, supra. In particular, the respondent has established that this Board did not reinstate the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure because the respondent’s prior attorney did not file proof that the respondent had paid the required voluntary departure bond. The respondent, in fact, had paid the bond in a timely manner.
 
In addition, it appears that the respondent might have become eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), while his case was on appeal to this Board. His motion indicates that his United States citizen daughter was born in December 2013, but his prior attorney did not file a motion to remand to pursue cancellation. The DHS states in its opposition to the current motion that the respondent’s voluntary return to Mexico makes him ineligible for cancellation, but the record does not contain sufficient evidence to establish that any of the respondent’s prior departures constitute breaks in presence. See Matter of Garcia-Ramirez, 26 I&N Dec. 674 (BIA 2015); Matter of Castrejon-Colino, 26 I&N Dec. 667 (BIA 2015). This issue also was not addressed in any detail during the respondent’s hearing before the Immigration Judge, and both the Immigration Judge’s decision and our prior ruling in the respondent’s case were issued before our decisions in Matter of Castrejon-Colino, supra, and Matter of Garcia-Ramirez, supra.
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and we remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to determine if the respondent is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, or, in the alternative, to give him the opportunity to apply for voluntary departure.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Saman J. Nasseri, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorely R. Fernandez
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeared before an Immigration Judge on July 8, 2010, and, pursuant to the respondent’s own motion, was ordered removed from the United States. On October 17, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2016, decision denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as his former attorney did not advise him of the availability of voluntary departure. He requests that the Board equitably toll the 90-day period to file his motion, and reopen and remand these proceedings for a voluntary departure hearing.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). Most notably, the respondent has not established that he submitted a complaint against his former counsel with an appropriate disciplinary authority and informed counsel of the allegations. Hence, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. We therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to decline equitable tolling of the 90-day period to file a motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion is therefore untimely.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan L. Rocha, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julie Nelson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2016, denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion because it was untimely and the respondent did not establish that he warranted sua sponte reopening.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The respondent’s proceedings concluded in December 2011, and he filed the instant motion in July 2016. Thus, the respondent’s motion is untimely by over 4 years. The respondent did not argue that equitable tolling applies as an exception to the filing deadline, and thus, the Immigration Judge did not consider if such exception would apply here. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that equitable tolling is available when an individual is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances). Thus, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion as untimely filed.
 
We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen sua sponte.1 Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances). The Immigration Judge ruled that the proceedings do not warrant sua sponte reopening based on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). At the outset, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not establish compliance with the procedural requirements to assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 4-6).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent contends that he did submit with his motion evidence of his notice to former counsel of his intent to file a motion based on ineffective assistance, as well as former counsel’s response (Resp. Br. at 4). He also argues that he was not required to file a complaint with the state bar or explain his failure to do so, and that his claim was based on his last attorney of record, Mr. Darius Amiri (Id.). The record does not contain the evidence the respondent asserts that he filed with his motion. The respondent’s submission of this evidence with his brief on appeal is insufficient, as he was required to file such proof with his motion before the Immigration Judge. Thus, based upon this lack of proof, the Immigration Judge properly found that respondent did not satisfy the procedural requirements for proving that he was ineffectively represented by his former attorney in these proceedings. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (noting that the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim are “necessary if we are to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.... Where essential information is lacking, it is impossible to evaluate the substance of such claim.”).
 
Moreover, the requirement that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim demonstrate the filing of a bar complaint serves to deter meritless claims and highlights the standards that should be expected of attorneys who represent aliens in immigration proceedings. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. It also serves to protect against collusion between alien and counsel in which ““““ineffective assistance” is tolerated, and goes unchallenged by an alien before disciplinary authorities, because it results in a benefit to the alien in that delay can be a desired end, in itself, in immigration proceedings. Matter of Rivera-Claws, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, does not require strict compliance with Matter of Lozada where “counsel’s ineffective assistance was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record.” Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000)). The respondent’s motion stated that he did file a bar complaint; however, on appeal he appears to state that he did not file a bar complaint because his former counsel’s ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the record, or on the other hand, he was trying to avoid filing a complaint so Mr. Amiri could explain his strategy (Resp. Br. at 7-9). We look to the motion as filed before the Immigration Judge, and note that the respondent did not present to the Immigration Judge proof of filing a bar complaint or Mr. Amiri’s response to his notice, and did not establish that the assistance was ineffective on the face of the record.
 
*3 Moreover, while not considered by the Immigration Judge, we note that the respondent’s motion was not supported by an application for cancellation of removal; and he has not submitted sufficient evidence showing that he has a qualifying relative who might suffer hardship rising to the level of ““““exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” upon his removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (providing that a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and “all supporting documentation”). Thus, the respondent did not establish a basis to reopen to apply for cancellation of removal. Likewise, with no accompanying application and supporting documentation, he has not established prejudice from any alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 669 (1984) (holding that a showing of prejudice requires that there be “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”).
 
Considering the totality of the respondent’s circumstances, we are not persuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Thus, we concur in the Immigration Judge’s decision to not exercise his sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

It is not evident from the respondent’s motion that he requested sua sponte reopening. However, because the Immigration Judge considered sua sponte reopening, we consider the denial of the motion on this basis, as well.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claudia Canizares, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hilary Rainone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on April 23, 2014, after not appearing at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on February 16, 2016, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 18, 2016, denying the motion. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances, to wit, ineffective assistance of counsel, prevented him from appearing at the hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (providing that a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal). The respondent filed his motion nearly two years after the issuance date of his order of removal. He argues that, notwithstanding the untimeliness of the motion, equitable tolling of the 180-day period is warranted. See Kokotis v. U.S. Postal Serv., 223 F.3d 275, 280 (4th Cir. 2000) (equitable tolling is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf); see also Kuusk v. Holder, 732 F.3d 302 (4th Cir. 2013).
 
In support of his request, the respondent argues that his former attorney did not sufficiently notify him of the hearing. He states that he received his order of removal 3 or 4 weeks after the hearing, and he was initially unable to obtain a new attorney. The respondent later filed a bar complaint against his former attorney with the North Carolina Bar Association, and it was rejected because his former attorney was licensed in Florida. The respondent then filed a bar complaint in Florida, to which his former attorney responded on December 3, 2015, and the respondent filed his motion to reopen within a reasonable period thereafter. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we will equitably toll the period for reopening and find that the respondent’s motion is timely filed.
 
In addition, we conclude that the respondent has established that exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance at the hearing. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1) (stating that the “[t]erm ‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien”). The respondent’s former counsel was sent notice of the hearing on or about January 15, 2014, and then waited until April 16, 2014, to mail notice to the respondent (Motion at Exhs. C, F). However, the notice was returned to former counsel, possibly because it did not include the respondent’s apartment number (Motion at Exhs. F, H). In addition, the respondent states that he contacted his former counsel’s office three or four times prior to the hearing, and he was not informed of the hearing date during any of those conversations (Motion at H). Former counsel has not responded to this accusation (Motion at C). In light of the foregoing, the respondent has established that exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance at the hearing.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order of removal is vacated, and these proceedings are reopened and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fairuze Sofia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kimberly Hillery
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
 
APPLICATION: Temporary Protected Status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 24, 2016, decision denying his application for Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent conceded that he is removable and sought TPS before the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 3; Exhs. 1, 3). His prior grant of TPS had been withdrawn in 2012 after the respondent did not re-register in 2009 (I.J. at 4; Exh. 2 at 1, 3). It does not appear that the respondent filed an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Unit (see Exh. 2 at 3). The respondent next tried to re-register in 2012 (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for relief, finding that he did not establish good cause sufficient to excuse his failure to re-register (I.J. at 5-6). The respondent appeals from that decision.
 
Section 244(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(5), sets forth that any administrative procedure for the review of the denial of TPS benefits shall not prevent an alien from asserting TPS protection in removal proceedings if the alien demonstrates that he or she is a national of a state designated under section 244(b)(1) of the Act. The regulations set forth at 8 C.F.R. part 1244, in turn, provide that an alien has the right to a de novo determination of his or her eligibility for TPS before an Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1244.10(d)(1), 1244.11, 1244.18(b). Thus, the respondent is eligible to assert his right to TPS while in removal proceedings. See Matter of Barrientos, 24 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 2007). He retains this eligibility even though he did not exhaust internal DHS appeal procedures. Matter of Lopez-Aldana, 25 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 2009).
 
*2 Aliens granted TPS must register annually. See 8 C.F.R. § 1244.17(a). Failure to do so, absent good cause, will cause the withdrawal of TPS. See section 244(c)(3)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1244.14(a)(3), 1244.17(c).
 
In this case, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish good cause sufficient to excuse his failure to re-register for TPS. The respondent testified that he did not re-register because he was planning on returning to El Salvador in 2009 (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34). The respondent testified that he ultimately decided not to travel to that country (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34, 36). However, at that point, the time for re-registration had passed (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34). He also contends that he received incorrect advice from a notary regarding the re-registration requirement (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 34). The respondent’s testimony about the notary was brief and without much detail. We are not convinced that the respondent demonstrated good cause, particularly where he conceded that he had re-registered for TPS for several years before 2009 (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 33-34).
 
The respondent in the alternative contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel repeatedly incorrectly indicated that the respondent was ineligible for TPS due to his criminal record (Respondent’s Brief at 5-7; I.J. at 3-4; see, e.g., Tr. at 4-7, 17-18). The respondent further contends that his counsel did not question him regarding his reasons for not re-registering for TPS until the Immigration Judge prompted him to do so (Respondent’s Brief at 6-7; Tr. at 33). We note that in each instance, the Immigration Judge took prompt corrective action. For instance, she noted that the respondent was denied TPS because he did not reregister, rather than because of his criminal history (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 17-20). Furthermore, she prompted the respondent’s counsel to question the respondent about his reasons for not reregistering (Tr. at 33). The Immigration Judge’s corrective actions at the very least tend to obviate any prejudice to the respondent. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988) (noting that a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing of prejudice).
 
More fundamentally, the respondent did not comply with the requirements announced in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent did not submit an affidavit from himself attesting to the relevant facts. Id. at 639. The respondent also has not demonstrated that he informed his counsel of the allegations and provided an opportunity for that counsel to respond. Id. Lastly, the record does not reflect that the respondent filed a complaint with the relevant disciplinary board or otherwise explained why he did not do so. Id. As such, the respondent has not set forth a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stacy Tolchin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On November 30, 2000, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen. The Board denied a motion to reopen filed by the respondent on February 24, 2015. On March 18, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the Government’s unopposed motion to remand proceedings to this Board. The Government sought a remand for the Board to address several issues relating to whether the respondent demonstrated due diligence for purposes of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. While the remand was pending, the respondent submitted a brief.
 
Upon review of the motion to remand filed by the Government in court, the respondent’s brief on remand, and the overall record of these deportation proceedings, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. As such, we will vacate our decision of February 24, 2015, grant the motion to reopen, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. On remand, the respondent may pursue any form of relief for which he may be eligible. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Board in this case dated February 24, 2015, is hereby vacated and the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

File: AXXX XX3 832 - Seattle, WA
March 6, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Erin T. Hall, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 16, 2016, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
 
On January 25, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings following the issuance of an in absentia order on October 20, 2015. Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances; or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the hearing, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of his own. See also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent alleges that he did not receive notice of his October 20, 2015, hearing because the notice was sent to his former attorney, he had been unable to reach his attorney for some time, and his former attorney did not inform him of his hearing (Respondent’s Brief at 3, 8; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 9). Although the respondent states that he did not receive notice of his October 20, 2015, hearing, he does not base his motion on lack of notice. Rather, he alleges that he did not appear because of exceptional circumstances. Specifically, the respondent alleges that he was unable to reach his prior attorney despite making several attempts, and he eventually retained another attorney to represent him (Respondent’s Brief at 8-9; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7-8).
 
The record reflects that on October 20, 2015, the respondent’s former attorney attended the respondent’s hearing, and submitted a motion to withdraw as counsel, which was granted by the Immigration Judge. In the motion to withdraw, prior counsel states that she had been unable to communicate with the respondent for several months and was unsure if he still resided at the same address, which was last confirmed in July 2013 (see Administrative Record of Proceedings, Motion to Withdraw as Counsel, dated October 20, 2015). We note that although prior counsel indicates in her motion that a copy of the respondent’s hearing notice was mailed to his last known address, the motion does not include a copy of counsel’s letter or indicate the date that the hearing notice was mailed.
 
*2 The record also reflects that the respondent had timely appeared for his prior hearing, on May 10, 2013. Furthermore, the respondent promptly filed a timely motion to reopen his removal proceedings and to rescind the in absentia removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; see Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938-39 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that where counsel’s secretary misinformed petitioners of the date of their hearing, causing them to be absent, ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes exceptional circumstances); see also Singh v. Gonzales, 168 F. App’x 800, 801 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because petitioner was provided the wrong time of his hearing by his attorney, ineffective assistance of counsel constituted an exceptional circumstance under the circumstances, which warranted reopening).
 
We conclude that the respondent’s actions before and after the entry of the in absentia removal order exhibited a reasonable level of diligence. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 677 (9th Cir. 2011) (stating that due diligence is determined by assessing when a reasonable person in the alien’s position would suspect fraud or error, what steps, if any, the alien took to investigate, and at what point the alien learns of the harm); Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1095-97 (9th Cir. 2007) (requiring due diligence for equitable tolling of the time limitations for motions to reopen). Consequently, under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that reopening of proceedings is warranted. Thus, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the record of proceeding will be remanded for further proceedings. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600 (BIA 1978) (stating that a “remand is effective for the stated purpose and for consideration of any and all matters which the immigration judge deems appropriate in the exercise of his administrative discretion”).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The in absentia order of removal is rescinded, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jared S. Lawrence, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2016, decision finding the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal abandoned and ordering him removed. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On appeal counsel alleges that prior counsel provided ineffective assistance to the respondent by failing to file his application for cancellation of removal by the date set by the Immigration Judge, which failure led the Immigration Judge to deem the application abandoned. Counsel has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 1988), in which we set out the procedural requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s December 2, 2016, Motion to Remand. We therefore conclude that the respondent has established ineffective assistance below, and we therefore will remand the record to provide the respondent the opportunity to file his relief application with the Immigration Judge.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven R. Espinoza, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reissuance
 
*1 On July 11, 2016, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to reissue the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2015, decision. The respondent has appealed from the denial. The record does not contain a response from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see, e.g., Ridore v. Holder, 696 F.3d 907, 915 (9th Cir. 2012) (discussing Board’s scope of review).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge in Lancaster, California on November 22, 2000, and was subsequently removed from the United States. On May 31, 2005, an Immigration Judge in Eloy, Arizona, entered a second order of removal against him and he again was removed from the United States. In 2013, the DHS reinstated the 2005 order of removal against the respondent and removed him from the United States for a third time.
 
On December 8, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his 2000 proceeding.1 The Immigration Judge denied this motion, but the respondent was unable to file an appeal due to errors in the office of his current counsel. The respondent filed a motion to reissue with the Immigration Judge in March 2016 explaining the errors, but the Immigration Judge denied the motion. The respondent filed a second motion to reissue on June 20, 2016. The Immigration Judge again denied the motion, and the respondent now has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision.2
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he had not satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988), or substantially complied with these requirements. The respondent further claims that he has acted with reasonable diligence and shown prejudice. Accordingly, he maintains that the Immigration Judge should have equitably tolled the time and numeric limits on his motion and granted reissuance. Finally, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge should have granted his motion in the interest of justice pursuant to her sua sponte authority.
 
The Immigration Judge is correct that the respondent’s second motion to reissue is untimely and numerically barred (I.J. at 2). Further, even if the respondent did act diligently in pursuing his motions to reissue and did comply or substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, he has not shown prejudice. See Siong v. INS, 376 F.3d 1030, 1037 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that prejudice is presumed when counsel’s error deprives alien of appellate proceeding but recognizing that prejudice may be rebutted if there are no plausible grounds for relief). Specifically, the respondent has not established that filing an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2015, decision could change the result in his case. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s ultimate refusal to grant the respondent’s motion to reissue her prior ruling on the basis of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is correct. See Siong v. INS, supra.
 
*2 For similar reasons, the Immigration Judge’s failure to grant sua sponte reissuance of her decision does not provide a proper basis for sustaining the respondent’s appeal. We therefore dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Footnotes

1

We note that the respondent has not sought reopening of his 2005 removal proceedings. There also is no indication in the record that these proceedings were consolidated with the 2000 proceedings.

2

In recounting this procedural history in her July 11, 2016, decision, the Immigration Judge made several factual errors. First, the Immigration Judge suggested that her December 21, 2015, decision ordered the respondent removed at the conclusion of proceedings (I.J. at 1-2). The decision, in fact, denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge also stated that the respondent appealed from her denial of his first motion to reissue (I.J. at 1-2). The respondent did not appeal; the respondent instead filed, with the Board, a motion to accept untimely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2015, denial of his motion to reopen. The Board denied this motion on April 27, 2016. The Board did not review the Immigration Judges’ denial of the first motion to reissue. Because the Immigration Judge’s factual errors do not affect the outcome of our decision, however, remand is not required.

*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 10, 2015. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening his removal proceedings sua sponte and then administratively closing proceedings, in order that he may seek a provisional unlawful presence waiver and pursue consular processing.1 Upon de novo review, we conclude that the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening of his proceedings is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We recognize that, among other equities, the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. He has a United States citizen child, as well as two stepchildren. We also acknowledge the respondent’s assertion that he failed to appear at his 2006 removal hearing due to the misadvice of an immigration attorney.
 
However, upon consideration of the record as a whole, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has presented insufficient evidence of circumstances that would justify a discretionary grant of his untimely motion to reopen and the extraordinary remedy of reopening his removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g.. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations); INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 450-51 (1985) (finding that equities which are obtained after the entry of a final deportation order do not create substantial equities). The respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear containing the date and time of his scheduled hearing. Insofar as the respondent asserts that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that he hired an attorney or that she filed any application on his behalf. Nor did the respondent comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Finally, we decline the respondent’s request to reopen and administratively close these proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander Y. Chan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2016, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment - and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges - de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the motion is untimely, where the respondent was ordered removed on May 24, 2012, but did not file the instant motion to reopen until October 3, 2016. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal). We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not state any new facts to be proven and did not file any relief applications in conjunction with his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge that, to the extent that the respondent was making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he did not comply with the requirements for making such a claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, the record does not show a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013). In fact, the respondent, who was not represented during his removal hearings below, does not refer to any specific attorney in his motion; rather, he claims that he “‘received ineffective advice from another [unnamed] attorney that he not object to entry of his removal order so that he could be released from custody.” Under these circumstances, the respondent did not meet his burden for making such a claim.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On January 22, 2016, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen based on a claimed violation of due process, including ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, now appeals. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Vitug v. Holder, 723 F.3d 1056, 1063 (9th Cir. 2013); Ridore v. Holder, 696 F.3d 907, 915-16 (9th Cir. 2012); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On March 21, 2006, the respondent was convicted of aggravated assault in Arizona. A Notice to Appear was issued charging the respondent with being inadmissible under sections 212(a)(6)(A)(i) and 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. On August 24, 2006, an Immigration Judge in Eloy, Arizona, granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal to Mexico. At the time the respondent was represented by attorneys from Stender & Pope (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br at 3; Motion at 3).1
 
The respondent re-entered the United States on January 1, 2007. On June 30, 2009, the respondent was convicted of disorderly conduct in Arizona and was sentenced to 1 year of imprisonment. He was issued a Notice to Appear on January 11, 2010.
 
On February 3, 2010, before an Immigration Judge in Florence, Arizona, the respondent admitted the allegations set forth in the Notice to Appear, and conceded the charges of removability. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent to be removed.
 
On December 30, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order with the Immigration Court in Florence (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 3; Motion at 3). The respondent asserts that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel during the 2006 proceedings, because his prior attorney failed to discover the existence of a visa petition that was filed in 1998 by his lawful permanent resident father and approved on October 9, 2002. The respondent also asserts that the government had an obligation to inform him and his father of the visa petition’s approval, but failed to do so. He argues that, at the time of the 2006 proceedings, the approved and then-current visa petition would have provided an opportunity for him to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act as the “child” (at that time) of a lawful permanent resident, in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. Thus, he asserts that his 2006 decision to accept voluntary departure and waive his appeal rights was not considered and intelligent because his prior counsel and the government did not make him aware of his eligibility for relief (Respondent’s Br. at 6-7, 8, 9-10; Motion at 6-7, 8, 9-10; Attached Exh. K).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order, because he determined that the motion was not properly before him. The Immigration Judge, citing regulations, determined that the motion should have been filed with the Eloy Immigration Court because that court had created the record of proceedings for the 2006 order and, thus, had administrative control over the record of proceedings (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a) (providing that all documents and applications that are to be considered in a proceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having administrative control over the record of proceedings).
 
The respondent also argues that he has substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Respondent’s Br. at 11; Motion at 11). Further, the respondent argues that the proceedings in 2010 violated due process because the 2006 proceedings were invalid and because a knowing and voluntary waiver of rights was not obtained. He contends that either the general deadline for seeking reopening should be equitably tolled or proceedings should be reopened sua sponte.
 
Even if the Immigration Judge incorrectly determined that the motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order was not properly before him, the respondent did not demonstrate prejudice for purposes of his due process violation claim, specifically regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, we will affirm the decision to deny the motion to reopen.
 
As stated, the respondent contends that he was not aware of his father’s approved visa petition when he accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure in 2006. Our review of the 2006 record reflects that there was no discussion of the 2002 approved petition by either party.
 
Nonetheless, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s acceptance of pre-conclusion voluntary departure was not considered and intelligent. The record reflects that the respondent knew about the approved petition filed by his mother; indeed, it was admitted into the record as Exhibit 2. Yet, at the hearing on August 24, 2006, the respondent’s prior counsel informed the Immigration Judge that the parties agreed to pre-conclusion voluntary departure (Tr. dated August 24, 2006, at 33). The respondent informed the Immigration Judge that he accepted the voluntary departure order and waived appeal (DHS Br. in Opposition to Motion to Reopen at 1-3; Tr. dated August 24, 2006, at 34-35). Thus, the record reflects that the respondent’s acceptance of pre-conclusion voluntary departure was considered and intelligent, and his waiver of appeal rights was knowing and voluntary.
 
Based on this information, we conclude that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudice. It appears from the record that the respondent’s decision to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure was strategic. As the beneficiary of his mother’s approved visa petition, the respondent could have applied for an immigrant visa from the United States consulate in Mexico. Thus, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order.
 
*3 We next address the Immigration Judge’s denial of the aspect of the motion to reopen relating to the validity of the 2010 proceedings. The Immigration Judge assumed for purposes of analysis that the 2010 proceedings violated the respondent’s due process rights, but ultimately concluded that reopening was not warranted because the respondent was not eligible for the relief sought. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent re-entered the United States after his 2006 voluntary departure, had accrued 1 year of unlawful presence before the voluntary departure,2 and was “““seeking admission” via the adjustment of status application. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent therefore was inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, and thus, was not eligible for the relief sought, i.e., adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act (I.J. at 3).
 
We held in Matter of Lemus-Losa, 25 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 2012), that adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act is unavailable to an alien who is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, absent a waiver. See id. at 734, 744-45. The respondent did not request a waiver under section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act in conjunction with his motion to reopen. Indeed, the respondent did not address on appeal the Immigration Judge’s determination that he was inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, and thus, was not eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act. We discern no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen with respect to the 2010 removal order.
 
Finally, inasmuch as the respondent did not apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act, and, is not otherwise eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act based on his inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, there is no basis to reopen sua sponte either by the Immigration Judge or the Board (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17; Motion at 16-17).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey Rubin, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals an Immigration Judge’s August 11, 2016, order denying her second untimely motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues that her proceedings should be reopened and the in absentia order rescinded because her previous counsel provided ineffective representation, by failing to calendar the hearing in his book or to inform the respondent about it, and then by attempting to file two motions to reopen that were procedurally defective and consequently rejected. Also, the respondent maintains that exceptional circumstances prevented her from earlier seeking to reopen proceedings, in that she did not have the necessary funds to hire another attorney and she was caring for her pregnant daughter with special needs.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia order that had been entered on March 2, 2012. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). It is also number-barred, as it is the second motion to reopen filed in this case. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
Also, even if we were to consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we would nonetheless affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and to rescind the in absentia order, as the respondent failed to show that she exercised due diligence in pursuing reopening of her removal proceedings. The respondent’s contention that we should reopen proceedings sua sponte because she lacked the financial means to secure another attorney after the entry of her in absentia order, and was devoted to the care of her pregnant daughter with special needs, presents sympathetic circumstances but is not sufficient to excuse the nearly 4-year delay in the submission (on March 2, 2016) of her initial properly filed motion to reopen the March 2, 2012, in absentia order, or to persuade us that she was duly diligent in seeking reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 We recognize that the respondent asserted in the declaration accompanying her most recent motion to reopen that she did not even learn that she had a removal order until she sought the assistance of her current counsel (Exh. J to Motion filed July 22, 2016). However, in a letter to the Office of the Bar Counsel in Massachusetts in response to a complaint filed by the respondent, her former counsel states - and the respondent apparently has not disputed - that he forwarded the respondent’s file to her current counsel’s office in August of 2013 (Exh. N to Motion filed July 22, 2016). Thus, even if the time that elapsed before the respondent consulted her current counsel is not taken into account, or is viewed as tolled, the respondent still waited over 2½ years after that consultation before filing her March 2, 2016, motion to reopen - more than 2 years beyond the normal time limit even after equitable tolling. See Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30 (1st Cir. 2010) (generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way); Bead v. Holder, 703 F.3d 591 (1st Cir. 2013). We do not conclude that the circumstances presented by the respondent suffice to justify such a lengthy delay, and we therefore will decline to reopen proceedings on the basis of either equitable tolling or our sua sponte authority.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of Honduras, have filed an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 18, 2016, denying their request for a continuance and deeming their applications for relief abandoned. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondents failed to establish good cause for a continuance in their case (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). The Immigration Judge noted below that counsel made only a verbal request for a continuance with no supporting documentary evidence (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 20-22, 24).2 Compare Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (setting forth factors to consider when adjudicating a motion for a continuance based on a pending visa petition, noting that focus should be on ultimate likelihood of success on adjustment application). On appeal, counsel argues that the respondents were denied due process. However, to date counsel has still not submitted evidence that he timely mailed the respondents’ asylum application (Form I-589) to the court, and it is not contained in the record before us. We conclude that the respondents have failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing any claims to relief. See Matter of Sibrun, supra, at 356.
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondents have not shown such (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 1-25). See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). Furthermore, the respondents have failed to show prejudice. See Matter of Sibrun, supra, at 356-58. As noted above, to date they have not shown the pendency of any applications for relief. Id. Finally, we are not persuaded that sua sponte reopening would be appropriate in this case, where they have failed to establish due diligence in pursuing relief from removal. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (party seeking reopening bears heavy burden); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (requirements for filing motion to reopen based on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 We also agree with the Immigration Judge deeming all applications for relief abandoned (I.J. at 2). A potential applicant must file all application forms on or before a filing deadline set by the Immigration Court. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The respondents were represented by the same attorney below and on appeal, who was informed of the filing deadline of July 18, 2016 on the record (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 17). To date, counsel for the respondents has not proffered a complete Form I-589 or supporting documents, and has not submitted evidence that the application was timely filed.3
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcelle Anne Rice, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrew J. Hewitt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. On January 22, 2001, the Board summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge. Over 15 years later, on November 4, 2016, the respondent filed the current motion to reopen. The motion to reopen is untimely. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent alleges that proceedings should be reopened and remanded due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Alternatively, the respondent seeks sua sponte reopening or reissuance of our January 22, 2001, decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes reopening. The motion is denied.
 
Equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel generally requires a litigant to show (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way. Avila-Santoyo v. Atty Gen., 713 F.3d. 1357, 1363 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2013). The respondent’s former attorney has been disbarred. The respondent claims that his former attorney was ineffective because she did not file an appeal brief on his behalf, and, therefore, the Board summarily dismissed his appeal. This argument is inaccurate because the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision under former 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(a)(7).1 See Mendoza v. Atty Gen., 327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent also asserts that under the circumstances, he acted diligently in filing the present motion (Motion at p. 15). The respondent claims that he consulted with a law firm in 2011, but he did not pursue his rights because he was ashamed, embarrassed and discouraged (Motion, Exh. B). The respondent’s explanation is insufficient to show either that he has been pursuing his rights diligently since his appeal was dismissed in 2001, or that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way since that time. During the intervening years, the DHS deported him several times (DHS Opposition, Exhs. A-D), which placed the respondent on notice, but he still did not pursue his immigration rights diligently. As such, we find that equitable tolling does not apply here.
 
The respondent also seeks sua sponte reopening. He argues that he is no longer removable as charged, and that his family would be upset if he were deported. However, the respondent was properly removable as charged in 2001, and his reliance on precedent from the Ninth Circuit is not binding on the Board as this proceeding is governed by Eleventh Circuit precedent. Moreover, although it appears that he voluntarily departed during the pendency of his appeal (DHS Opposition, Exh. A), the Board considered his appeal, and summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. Further, the respondent was removed on at least one other occasion during the intervening years (DHS Opposition, Exh. D). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our sua sponte discretionary authority to reopen proceedings because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*2 Last, the respondent requests that we reissue our January 22, 2001, decision so that he may file a petition for review with the Eleventh Circuit (Motion, p. 19). We decline to reissue our January 22, 2001, because the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence. Although not argued by respondent, we note that he has highlighted certain items in his exhibits as if to imply that the Board erroneously mailed our decision to the physical location of his former attorney’s office, as opposed to a P.O. Box (Motion, Exh. W). The record of proceeding indicates that the decision was properly mailed to the address listed on the Notice of Entry of Appearance filed by the respondent’s former attorney, and there is no indication that our decision was returned as undeliverable. See Motion, Exh. W. Last, due to the respondent’s interactions with DHS since issuance of the 2001 decision, he was on notice that a final Board decision had been issued in this case. For the forgoing reasons, the motion will be denied.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aaron Chenault, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 8, 2016, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served personally on the respondent on January 22, 2016 (Exh. 1). At a hearing on February 29, 2016, the Immigration Judge informed the respondent and her attorney that her failure to appear for her next scheduled hearing and to meet the filing deadline for her application for relief would result in an order of removal (I.J. at 2). On March 8, 2016, the respondent filed a motion for a change of venue. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion and specifically noted that the application for relief was still due by March 10, 2016. Id. As the respondent did not appear for her hearing on March 10, 2016, and did not file an application for relief, the Immigration Judge ordered that all claims for relief were deemed abandoned and ordered the respondent removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c).
 
On July 26, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The respondent argued that exceptional circumstances caused her failure to appear for her hearing, as she did not believe she was required to appear for it or that she was required to submit her application by that date due to her release from immigration custody (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not demonstrated that exceptional circumstances caused her to miss her filing deadline and that the record did not warrant sua sponte reopening (I.J. at 3).1
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. A failure to request relief in accordance with a schedule set by the Immigration Judge constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to file for such relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (stating that if an application is not filed within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed abandoned). The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979).
 
*2 The administrative record reflects that the Immigration Judge informed both the respondent and her attorney that she must file the application for relief by her next hearing on March 10, 2016, or her application for relief would be deemed abandoned and she would be ordered removed (I.J. at 2). See Respondent’s Motion to Change Venue at 1. The respondent and her attorney did not file any applications for relief by the filing deadline. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent’s claims for relief were deemed abandoned.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent and her counsel’s “““purported ignorance” do not warrant reopening of her proceedings (I.J. at 2). The respondent argued that her counsel’s clerk informed her that she did not need to appear for her March 10, 2016, hearing, and that she was unaware she was required to adhere to a filing deadline. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-3. The respondent’s counsel argued that he understood the Immigration Judge’s instructions to mean that the respondent must adhere to the filing deadline if she were still detained and on the detained docket. Id. at 6.
 
An attorney’s administrative error is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998); see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board). The respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to timely file her applications for relief. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit setting forth the facts and her agreement with her counsel, nor has she provided any evidence that her counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before she filed her brief to the Board, nor did she indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against that attorney. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, supra, at 647. Thus, reopening is not warranted in this matter, as the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Lozada. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In his decision dated March 10, 2016, the Immigration Judge did not issue an in absentia order of removal. As the Immigration Judge did not actually order the respondent removed in absentia, the respondent’s motion to reopen on the basis of exceptional circumstances for failure to appear is inapplicable. Moreover, in a deportation case pursuant to section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that where an alien failed to appear for a hearing and the Immigration Judge issued an order stating that all claims for relief were deemed abandoned, the hearing was not held in absentia. See Williams-Igwonobe v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 453 (5th Cir. 2006).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board to reconsider its September 22, 2016, decision dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2016, decision denying his untimely motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006); section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent was found removable as charged on November 17, 2005, and removed thereafter to Mexico. The respondent then returned to the United States, and was removed a second time in September 2012. On December 18, 2014, the respondent moved to reopen the removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent asserted that pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47 (2006), his conviction for possession of a controlled substance was no longer considered an aggravated felony, thus rendering him eligible to apply for cancellation of removal. He further asserted that he was not precluded from filing a motion to reopen his removal proceedings because the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (“circuit court”) had abrogated the departure bars at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d) and 1003.23(b)(1). See Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257 (5th Cir. 2012). In a decision dated February 4, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely, and the respondent appealed.
 
On November 17, 2015, the Board remanded the respondent’s case to the Immigration Judge to consider whether equitable tolling of the filing deadline applied to the respondent’s motion to reopen. In remanded proceedings, the respondent argued that equitable tolling should apply because he did not learn of the decision in Garcia-Carias v. Holder, supra, until late in 2014. On January 13, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely, and on September 22, 2016, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that decision.1 The respondent now seeks our reconsideration.
 
The dispositive issue before the Board on appeal was whether the Immigration Judge properly determined that the equitable tolling of the filing deadline imposed on the motion to reopen was not warranted. In our decision, we found no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s attorney filed a Notice of Entry of Appearance (Form EOIR-28) on the respondent’s behalf on October 22, 2012, and we agreed with the conclusion that the respondent did not demonstrate his diligence or an extraordinary circumstance following the issuance of Garcia-Carias v. Holder, supra, on September 27, 2012, to warrant equitable tolling. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016). In the instant motion, the respondent asserts that he was unaware of his attorney’s representation at that time. The respondent’s assertion, however, does not alter the fact that he was represented by counsel in October 22, 2012, and that the motion to reopen was not filed until December 18, 2014. Further, the respondent has not raised any allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 The respondent also contests the Board’s finding that his contentions on appeal regarding the fairness of the proceedings before the Immigration Judge lacked merit. The respondent argued on appeal that the Immigration Judge acted in a biased and impartial manner because he admonished the respondent’s attorney for failing to disclose information pertinent to the respondent’s second removal from the United States. In this motion to reconsider, the respondent argues that such information was irrelevant to the issue of equitable tolling. The respondent, however, has offered no persuasive argument that the Immigration Judge’s criticism of the respondent’s attorney prejudiced the outcome of this case in any way. See generally Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982).
 
In sum, we find no error of fact or law in our prior order to warrant reconsideration.2 See Matter of O-S-G-, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

The respondent’s petition for judicial review of the Board’s September 22, 2016, decision is currently pending. Guerrero-Soto v. Lynch, No. 16-60693 (5th Cir., filed 19 Oct. 2016).

2

To the extent that the respondent argues that the Board and the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening the proceedings sua sponte, we emphasize that the circuit court has upheld the application of the departure bar to untimely motions to reopen removal proceedings. See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 296-98 (5th Cir. 2009); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672, 675-76 (5th Cir. 2003). This Board and the Immigration Judge thus lack jurisdiction to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte in light of the departure bars at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d) and § 1003.23(b)(1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray David Hilts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elly Laff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 26, 2016, denying his motion to reopen the instant removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent contended that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 3-4; Mot. dated May 24, 2016, at 4-8). Specifically, the respondent alleged that he was pro se in the prior proceedings and would have applied for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a),1 but for the Immigration Judge’s erroneous advisal that his conviction for possession of a controlled substance, to wit: marijuana, in violation of CAL. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 11350(a), was for an aggravated felony, and thereby rendered him ineligible for any form of relief from removal. He further argued that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled because he did not learn of the error until 2015, after he consulted with present counsel. The respondent further argued in the alternative that the proceedings should be reopened in the exercise of the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte authority.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the motion, holding that it was untimely filed and was not subject to the one of the regulatory exceptions to the filing deadline (I.J. at 4) and, moreover, that the respondent did not establish that a due process violation warranted reopening (I.J. at 4-5). The Immigration Judge also declined to reopen the proceedings sua sponte (I.J. at 5-7).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he was properly advised of his eligibility for relief based on the law at the time of the hearing (Resp’t Br. at 5-10). On this point, he argues that the Immigration Judge conducting the 2004 hearing should have found that the respondent’s state crime did not fall under the first or the second prong of the definition of aggravated felony set forth in section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). The respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in refusing to toll the filing deadline for his motion, asserting that the Immigration Judge considered tolling in the context of considering reopening in the exercise of his sua sponte authority but not on the basis of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and overlooked the equities in the record (Resp’t Br. at 2-3, 10-13). The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge should have reopened the proceedings in the exercise of his sua sponte authority (Resp’t Br. at 13-14).
 
*2 On review, we are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s decision should be reversed. First, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion was untimely filed, see section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and that the motion did not fall within the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the motions time limits in removal proceedings, see sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).
 
Second, while an Immigration Judge has a duty “to inform an alien of “‘apparent eligibility’ for relief,” see, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, 629 F.3d 894, 896-97 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(a)(2)), the respondent has not cited any authority supporting his contention that an Immigration Judge performing this duty is to be regarded as the respondent’s attorney, and that a deficiency in the performance of this duty is redressed by a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We are thus not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate contention that the Immigration Judge rendered ineffective assistance of counsel and that the motions time limits may be equitably tolled consistent with the standards applicable to motions premised on a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel. Rather, we agree with the Immigration Judge that such a claim sounds in due process, and that the respondent has not established that he was denied due process of law.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, we find that the Immigration Judge’s actions were consistent with a fair hearing, and find no support for the respondent’s claims as to a denial of due process. The Immigration Judge in 2004 evaluated the relief available under the law then applicable, which did not establish the respondent’s apparent eligibility for relief. See Valencia v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 1261 (9th Cir. 2008) (alien lacking apparent eligibility for relief from removal did not have due process right to notice of such relief). As DHS contended below, the Immigration Judge reasonably explained to the respondent that he did not have an opportunity to apply for relief because his conviction was considered to be for an aggravated felony under then-current law (DHS Opp. dated June 7, 2016, at 6), and the respondent knowingly and voluntarily accepted his removal order and waived his right to appeal (I.J. at 5).
 
Moreover, even assuming the respondent was apparently eligible for cancellation of removal in 2004, he has not carried his burden of showing that he was prejudiced by the violation because he has not made a “‘plausible showing’ that an IJ presented with all of the facts would exercise discretion in the alien’s favor.” See United States v. Gonzalez-Flores, 804 F.3d 920 (9th Cir. 2015) (citing United States v. Rojas-Pedroza, 716 F.3d 1253, 1263-64 (9th Cir. 2013)).
 
*3 We are also not persuaded that the proceeding should be reopened in the exercise of sua sponte authority. The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the subsequent decisions in Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 1678 (2013), and Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47 (2006), holding that simple possession convictions were not felonies under the federal Controlled Substances Act, could be a fundamental change in law, see Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec, 1132 (BIA 1999), but he concluded that the respondent did not demonstrate that he acted with due diligence after the decisions were issued, see Matter of G-C-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 359 (BIA 2002) (setting forth reasons for no longer sua sponte reopening cases a reasonable period of time had passed from fundamental change in law). On this point, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent waited 3 years after the decision in Moncrieffe, and 10 years after the decision in Lopez, to file his motion to reopen, and he did not demonstrate why he waited 12 years before having counsel review his removal proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Monica N. Ganjoo, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)] - Conditional resident status terminated
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Iran, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 23, 2016, denying his motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him on February 22, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent received proper notice of his removal hearing because he was personally served with notice of the time, date, and place of the hearing. Section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). The respondent’s motion is untimely with respect to a claim of exceptional circumstances because he did not file his motion within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the applicable filing requirements based on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The doctrine of equitable estoppel applies when “despite all due diligence, [the party invoking equitable tolling] is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). Here, the respondent had been put on notice that he was in removal proceedings and was scheduled to appear for a hearing on February 22, 2011. Although the respondent states that former counsel did not inform him of the consequences of failure to attend the hearing, the respondent was informed of such both by the Notice to Appear which had been served on him by regular mail at his home address and by the Notice of Hearing. Sections 239(a)(1)(G)(ii) and 239(a)(2)(ii) of the Act.
 
*2 Additionally, he does not claim that former counsel instructed him not to appear for the hearing. Rather, he asserts that prior to the hearing, he had a falling out with counsel after discovering counsel had been suspended from practice, and he did not want to attend the hearing without representation. The respondent’s decision not to attend a scheduled hearing does not constitute an exceptional circumstance, nor is equitable tolling of the deadline warranted where the respondent has not shown that he was “unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Id. Finally, the respondent has not presented an “exceptional” situation sufficient to warrant sua sponte reopening of the proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Suraj R. Singh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rod Wolthoff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s May 26, 2016, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served personally on the respondent on February 16, 2016 (Exh. 1). A Notice of Hearing (NOH) dated March 11, 2016, was sent to the respondent’s former counsel scheduling a hearing for April 6, 2016. As the respondent did not appear for his hearing on April 6, 2016, the Immigration Judge ordered him removed in absentia.
 
On May 9, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, alleging lack of notice of his April 6, 2016, hearing. The respondent claimed that he did not receive an NOH and that his prior attorney told him that his case would automatically change venue from Harlingen, Texas, to New York, New York, upon the respondent’s release from immigration custody (I.J. at unnumbered 1). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent received constructive notice of the hearing, as the record showed that the Immigration Court mailed the respondent’s prior attorney an NOH informing him of his April 6, 2016, hearing. Id.
 
The respondent filed his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 19, 2016. On appeal, through new counsel, the respondent admits that he was aware of his scheduled hearing date of April 6, 2016, but asserts that the Immigration Judge did not properly consider his claim that his former counsel gave him wrong advice not to appear for that hearing. See Respondent’s Brief at unnumbered 3-4. In addition, the respondent alleges that his prior attorney’s misleading advice constituted exceptional circumstances that caused his failure to appear. See Respondent’s Brief at unnumbered 4.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. As the respondent’s attorney received notice of the hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that proper notice was provided to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent did not establish that he failed to appear for the hearing due to “““exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986).
 
*2 We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996).
 
An attorney’s administrative error or his failure to advise a client that a change of venue motion had not been granted and that he must appear for the hearing is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with Lozada; see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in not properly considering his claim of ineffective assistance concerning his former counsel. The respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit describing the facts and his agreement with his former counsel, nor has he provided any evidence that his former counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before he filed his brief to the Board, nor did he indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against his prior attorney. See id. Thus, reopening is not warranted in this matter, as the respondent has made no attempt to comply with the requirements set forth in Lozada. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yasmine Chahkar Farhang, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the decision of the Immigration Judge of May 11, 2016, denying his motion to reopen proceedings to rescind the in absentia removal order entered in the case based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal.
 
Considering the totality of circumstances presented, and given the evidence not previously available when these proceedings were last before the Immigration Judge, as well as the lack of opposition from the DHS, we will sustain the respondent’s appeal. Accordingly, the proceedings are reopened sua sponte under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge. The respondent is to be provided an opportunity to seek any relief for which he may be eligible on an updated record. We express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of this case.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision and entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Katherine Owen, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 14, 2016, when we dismissed as untimely the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent now seeks reconsideration of that decision. The respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent asserts that he was experiencing extreme financial hardship when his appeal was due and that he did not understand the consequences of failing to appeal in a timely manner. The respondent raised the claim of financial hardship when he submitted his appeal, and we considered that argument at that time. Further, the respondent appears to have been represented by counsel both in the filing of his motion to reopen and in filing an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of that motion. The respondent has not made a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has not explained why he was unable to file a fee waiver request with a timely appeal.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent has not established that reconsideration of our decision dated September 14, 2016, is warranted. We therefore deny his motion to reconsider.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

January 30, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. Oscar Shaw, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Petition to remove conditional basis of permanent residence
 
*1 This case is before us pursuant to an order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dated August 2, 2016, which denied the petition for review in part but remanded for the Board “to address [the petitioner’s] contention that her former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to pursue a hardship waiver.” We will again dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In our decision dated October 10, 2014, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent relief from removal. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was not credible and that she had not provided sufficient evidence to meet her burden of establishing that she entered into a “““good faith marriage” for purposes of a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B) (I.J. at 2-4). The Ninth Circuit dismissed the petition for review insofar as it challenged those findings. However, the Ninth Circuit remanded on the issue of whether the respondent’s prior counsel provided ineffective assistance because she did not file for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Act.
 
We conclude that the respondent did not establish that her former counsel provided ineffective assistance. Even assuming that failure to file an application for a waiver before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services could constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings, the respondent has not presented evidence that she substantially complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v. Lopez-Chavez, 757 F.3d 1033, 1044 (9th Cir. 2014); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 213 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent’s mere assertion of what action her former counsel should have taken is not sufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. Id.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that she suffered any prejudice as a result of the purported ineffective assistance of her former counsel. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that despite a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, prejudice had not been demonstrated and relief was correctly denied); United States v. Lopez-Chavez, supra, at 1043 (explaining that it is not only necessary to demonstrate that counsel’s ineffective assistance rendered proceedings unfair, but also that such deficient performance resulted in prejudice). She did not provide any evidence to demonstrate that she was eligible for and had a reasonable likelihood of receiving the waiver. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 827 (explaining that it is necessary to establish both eligibility for relief and a plausibility that relief could have been granted to substantiate a finding of prejudice).
 
The respondent represented that she would file the waiver application and associated receipt with the Board with a motion to remand (Respondent’s Brief at 16). In our prior decision, we noted that we had not received any supplemental filings and to date we have not received evidence that such a waiver application was filed (BIA Dec. dated Oct. 10, 2014, at 3 n.1). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2016. On appeal the respondent contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his former counsel conceded that his June 2, 2015, conviction for Indecency with a Child in violation of Texas Penal Code § 21.11(a)(1) qualifies as a sexual abuse of a minor aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A). See generally Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). However, the respondent’s conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony. See United States v. Najera-Najera, 519 F.3d 509, 511 (5th Cir. 2008); see also United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, 214 F.3d 601 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 22 I&N Dec. 991 (BIA 1999).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vinesh Patel, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
On September 30, 2015, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s oral motion for continuance, and found the respondent removable as charged. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, now appeals. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). An Immigration Judge also has broad discretionary authority in determining whether an alien has demonstrated good cause. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983).
 
On November 8, 2012, the respondent pled guilty to theft under TEX. PENAL CODE § 31.03(e)(4)(A). The respondent sought a continuance to provide an opportunity for his attorney in his criminal case to file a motion for a new trial based on a claim that his prior criminal attorney was ineffective. The respondent claimed that the prior attorney was ineffective because he did not warn the respondent of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea (Respondent’s Br. at unnumbered 2; Tr. at 8).
 
The respondent’s desire to seek post-conviction relief does not amount to “““good cause” for a continuance. The fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on a conviction in state criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). The respondent’s speculation that his conviction might be invalid, including for reasons related to ineffective assistance of counsel as in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br. at unnumbered 2). See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996); see also Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011); Milton v. Holder, 425 F. App’x. 407, 409 (5th Cir. 2011) (stating that “Padilla also does not suggest that immigration proceedings must be stayed while a Padilla-type claim is being pursued in post[-]conviction proceedings.”). Moreover, the respondent acknowledged at the September 30, 2015, hearing that the attorney for his criminal case had not yet filed the motion for a new trial, and he has not provided any evidence of such filing on appeal (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 8, 12).
 
*2 The respondent argues that his case is distinguished from Cabral v. Holder, supra. In that case, the alien sought to hold his appeal before the Board in abeyance so that he could pursue a motion to vacate state convictions upon which his removability was based. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, held that the Board properly denied the respondent’s request because it was speculative to conclude that the state court will vacate a state court conviction for reasons that remove it for immigration purposes. The respondent argues that his case is distinguishable because unlike in his case the alien in Cabral v. Holder, supra, did not collaterally attack his state conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and the court did not analyze the request under Padilla v. Kentucky, supra (Respondent’s Br. at unnumbered 2). This, however, is a distinction without a difference because the action underlying both the respondent’s motion for a continuance and Cabral’s request to hold the appeal in abeyance was a collateral attack on the alien’s state court conviction.
 
For these reasons we conclude that the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for a continuance. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s ruling in this case.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Richard Wenfeng Chen, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document (lead respondent)
 
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (co-respondents)
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondents have appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated February 5, 2016, denying their motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against them on May 4, 2015. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On January 1, 2015, the respondents were personally served with Notices to Appear (Exhs. 1, 1A, 1B, 1C; I.J. at 1-2). On April 21, 2015, a hearing notice was mailed to the respondents at the address provided by them informing them of a hearing scheduled for May 4, 2015 (Exh. 2; I.J. at 2). The respondents received proper notice of their removal hearing. Section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a).
 
On December 31, 2015, the respondents filed a motion to reopen and rescind the order of removal based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The two adult respondents assert in their affidavits that former counsel had told them they did not have to attend the hearing scheduled for May 4, 2015, in Seattle, Washington, because a motion to change venue to New York would be granted. They state that on October 12, 2015, they learned from current counsel that a removal order had been entered against them five months earlier.
 
An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded if, within 180 days, the alien files a motion to reopen that demonstrates that his or her absence was due to “exceptional circumstances.” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Ineffective assistance of counsel qualifies as an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia order of removal. Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2004); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 936-37 (9th Cir. 2003). Additionally, the 180-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled when an attorney’s fraudulent or ineffective performance “caus[ed] an essential action in her client’s case to be undertaken ineffectively, out of time, or not at all.” Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The party invoking equitable tolling must exercise due diligence in “obtain[ing] vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
*2 Before making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien generally must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Those requirements are as follows: (1) the alien should submit an affidavit detailing the agreement with former counsel; (2) the alien must notify former counsel of the allegations and afford counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. These requirements “are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Here, the respondents’ claims that former counsel told them they did not have to appear at the May 4, 2015 hearing and did not inform them of the removal order entered against them are not clear and obvious from the record. Therefore, they must comply with the Lozada requirements for making a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondents complied with the third Lozada requirement but did not comply with the first and second. With respect to the first Lozada requirement, the Immigration Judge stated that the respondents’ affidavits are not reflective of their own thoughts because they are nearly identical and, although they are bolstered by a cover page indicating a motion to change venue filed by their former counsel was rejected, two receipts are weaker evidence because they don’t identify the attorney’s name and are consecutively numbered despite being issued 11 days apart (I.J. at 3-4; Motion at Tabs A, B, and C). We disagree as the affidavits submitted by the respondents establish their compliance with the first Lozada requirement. The fact that the affidavits are nearly identical is neither surprising nor indicative of a lack of veracity where the respondents are a married couple who were placed in consolidated removal proceedings together, they have been represented at all times by the same attorneys, they are relying on the same set of facts, and the affidavits were prepared with the assistance of current counsel. The affidavits detailing the respondents agreement with, and interactions with, former counsel satisfy the first Lozada requirement.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondents did not satisfy the second Lozada requirement because their notification to former counsel of the filing of a complaint suggested that she should “forward all [of her] response [s] to the [Departmental Disciplinary] Committee, if any,” rather than with the Immigration Court. We agree with the Immigration Judge that this suggestion is in error, as the purpose of the second requirement is to prevent abusive practices before the Immigration Court by allowing the attorney “whose integrity or competence is being impugned to present his version of events if he so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. However, because the letter to the respondents’ former counsel specified that the complaint was filed pursuant to Matter of Lozada, she was sufficiently informed that the complaint was filed in connection with the respondent’s removal proceedings and could have filed a response with the Immigration Court if she so desired. Accordingly, the respondents complied with the second Lozada requirement.
 
*3 As we noted earlier, the Immigration Judge found that the respondents had complied with the third Lozada requirement. Additionally, the allegations made by the respondents, which are supported by documentary evidence, establish that the respondents received ineffective assistance from their former counsel. Because the respondents’ motion for rescission of the in absentia removal order is grounded on ineffective assistance of counsel, a showing of prejudice is not required. Lo v. Ashcroft, supra, at 939 n.6. Additionally, the respondents acted with due diligence in pursuing their claim after finding out that an in absentia removal order had been entered against them. Therefore, equitable tolling of the 180-day period for filing the motion is warranted. Accordingly, the respondents’ appeal will be sustained, the motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Slender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Peter Gannon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board’s decision entered on February 29, 2016, dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent filed the present untimely motion to reopen proceedings on October 19, 2016. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
In seeking untimely reopening, the motion claims ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of attorneys who represented him before the Immigration Judge. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held the time limit for filing a motion may be tolled and proceedings reopened when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case, and the alien is prejudiced. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2003). In Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003), the court held that an alien failed to show prejudice when he could not “show that his admissibility arguments might have been successful on appeal to the BIA.” In Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004), the court explained that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge, with all the attendant delays, bears a “heavy burden” of proof that new evidence would likely change the result in his case).
 
The record in this matter shows that the respondent had a full and fair opportunity to present his case. The Immigration Judge at the hearing, and the Board on de novo review, considered all relevant factors, both positive and negative, regarding the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility. See Decision of the Board, Feb. 29, 2016, at 2-3; I.J. at 4-8. With the present motion, the respondent has submitted additional evidence of hardship to his United States citizen relatives, primarily concerning their health. See Mot., Tabs F-L. But the relatives’ health conditions were considered by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 7), and the hardship together with the respondent’s other positive factors were determined not to outweigh his forgery offense involving a significant sum, lack of rehabilitation, and use of another’s identity documents for employment purposes. The additional evidence, even if it had been offered by counsel at the hearing, would not have led to a different weighing of the discretionary factors. The record indicates that the respondent’s counsel presented evidence of the positive factors and the motion does not demonstrate that counsel’s performance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
*2 As the respondent has not established that counsel failed to offer evidence with which he might have been successful upon the Board’s de novo review on appeal, we conclude that ineffective assistance and prejudice are not established. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra; see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion to reopen does not demonstrate any “exceptional situation” that would warrant reopening these proceedings under the Board’s limited sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The motion therefore will be denied as time-barred.1
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and the related request for a stay are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Conlon, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent was found subject to removal as an aggravated felon, based on November, 2010, Connecticut state convictions for Sale of Certain Illegal Drugs and Conspiracy to Commit Sale of Certain Illegal Drugs. We dismissed his appeal on March 17, 2015, and denied previous motions on July 8, 2015, and April 29, 2016. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on October 31, 2016, that was untimely filed, and exceeds numerical limitations. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. We will reopen the proceedings under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
Evidence is presented that, on June 29, 2016, a state court judge granted the respondent’s petition for habeas corpus relief, allowed withdrawal of the respondent’s guilty pleas, and vacated the judgment of convictions. This decision was based on a finding that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel as set out in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010).
 
The Board finds that the evidence presented establishes that the underlying convictions which served as the basis for the respondent being found subject to removal have been vacated due to a defect in the criminal proceedings. If a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006)(conviction vacated pursuant to Ohio law for failure of the trial court to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes). Considering the entirety of circumstances presented, the unopposed motion to terminate the removal proceedings against the respondent is granted, and these proceedings are terminated.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alex Galvez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the June 2, 2016, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his request for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance to pursue Consular processing and the filing of a waiver in conjunction with his approved I-130 visa petition filed by his citizen spouse. The Immigration Judge determined that the circumstances presented by the respondent, without more, failed to establish good cause for a continuance.
 
The decision whether to grant a continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Thus, an Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance request will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent establishes that the denial deprived him of his due process right to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996) (citing Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987)). The alien must show that actual prejudice materially affecting the outcome of the case resulted from the denial of the continuance. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).
 
In this case, the Immigration Judge considered the relevant facts and circumstances presented and concluded that the respondent had approximately 18 months to present evidence that he filed an I-601A waiver, yet none was filed. On March 20, 2014, the Immigration Judge administratively closed proceedings in order to allow the respondent to pursue the I-601A waiver. However, on October 22, 2015, the Department of Homeland Security filed a motion to re-calendar the case noting that there was no indication that the I-601A had been filed. (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge reset the case for June 2, 2016, whereupon the respondent explained that no action had been taken because of financial and family problems. (Tr. at 43).
 
On this record, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal that good cause was shown for a further continuance of proceedings. The respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request has compromised the fairness of his removal proceedings. Given the above facts, we find no good cause for the proceedings to have been continued any further.
 
To the extent the respondent contends that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, beyond his assertions he has not “““substantially” complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, the record does not demonstrate that the respondent received constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel that prejudiced his case. See Hernandez-Mendoza v. Gonzales, 537 F.3d 976, 978-79 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent raises the speculative possibility that he may have been eligible for other forms of relief, but presents no evidence or argument to support this assertion (Resp. Br. at 8-9).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Brian J. Hoffman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on August 17, 2016, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 10, 2016, decision, in which he denied the respondents’ January 8, 2016, motion to reopen.1 This timely motion to reconsider followed. The respondents’ request for a waiver of the appellate filing fee is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). Their motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider requests review based on alleged errors of law or fact in a prior decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219 n.3 (5th Cir. 2008) (defining a motion to reconsider and distinguishing such a motion from a motion to reopen); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (same). To the extent that the respondents reiterate their arguments regarding (1) their compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); (2) equitable tolling; and (3) the Board’s authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings, we are unpersuaded that the restatement of these arguments qualify as identified errors of law or fact in our prior decision. However, to the extent that the respondents raise new arguments identifying such alleged errors, we are unpersuaded that any errors exist for the reasons outlined below (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 4-20).
 
Starting with compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in our precedent for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondents urge us to adopt a test for motions filed before an Immigration Judge distinct from the test employed in Matter of Lozada, supra, and applied to a motion filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals in that specific case (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 6-14). See id. at 639. In this regard, the respondents specifically maintain that the requirement “““that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond” should be relaxed when a motion to reopen is filed before an Immigration Court, as Matter of Lozada, supra, did not involve this specific factual scenario (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 6-14). In the alternative, they argue that notice alone to prior counsel should be sufficient because to require otherwise would gut a respondent’s ability to timely file a motion before the Immigration Court or otherwise demonstrate due diligence (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 11-13).
 
*2 We are unpersuaded that an attorney’s opportunity to respond where the attorney is being accused of ineffective assistance is less important when a motion is filed directly with the Immigration Court than it is where jurisdiction over the motion lies with this Board. Moreover, imposing such a requirement does not, as the respondents suggest, force the respondents to wait indefinitely for a response from former counsel (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 8-10). It only requires that former counsel be furnished an opportunity to respond, and does not require a respondent to wait until an actual response is forthcoming. Accordingly, we thus conclude that our prior decision--following the specific language outlining procedural compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra--is not in error. See also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2014).
 
Nor are we persuaded that the respondents presented a sufficient basis for not strictly complying with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for purposes of evaluating their ineffective assistance claim (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 11-13). Instead, as we noted in our August 17, 2016, order, the lead respondent has not made clear what steps she took (and when she took such steps) in discovering the ineffective assistance alleged. As a result, we do not agree with the respondents’ assertion that the lead respondent demonstrated an adequate basis for not providing notice and an opportunity to respond for the respondents’ former counsel prior to filing their motion to reopen. In light of the foregoing, we again conclude that it is unnecessary to reach the substance of the respondents’ ineffective assistance claim, inasmuch as they maintain that the attorney’s deficient performance contributed to a notice problem and the respondents’ non-appearance at their final scheduled hearing (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 13-14).
 
Turning to the issue of equitable tolling, we acknowledge that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arises, clarified its stance on this concept during the pendency of the respondents’ original appeal (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 14-17). See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016) (explicitly explaining that the concept of equitable tolling is available within the Fifth Circuit and applies to the 90-day deadline generally applicable to motions to reopen in immigration proceedings). However, we conclude that the publication of Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, supra, and the fact that we did not cite to or apply it in our August 17, 2016, decision does not alter the outcome in these proceedings.
 
*3 In this regard, the respondents assert in their motion to reconsider that we overlooked their appellate arguments on this topic, but this is a mischaracterization of our decision (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 16-17). First, our decision noted that the respondents did not raise this issue before the Immigration Judge. The decision not to raise the issue was significant, as that is a basis for finding a waiver of the issue on appeal. See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007). However, in considering the issue raised for the first time on appeal here, and assuming the availability of equitable tolling within the Fifth Circuit, we concluded that the respondents did not persuasively establish that they benefit from such tolling. Accordingly, we conclude that Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, supra, does not alter the analysis in our August 17, 2016, decision. Nor does the absence of a citation to that decision demonstrate an error of law therein.
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondents maintain that we erred in declining to independently exercise our authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte (as opposed to reversing the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening), we are unpersuaded by their argument that the regulations accorded us such authority in the context of our August 17, 2016, decision (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 20). However, notwithstanding the jurisdictional challenge, we independently determined that sua sponte reopening was not warranted in this case when reviewing the Immigration Judge’s decision. Because we concluded de novo that no exceptional circumstances exist, we agreed with the Immigration Judge that sua sponte reopening was not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reconsider is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Russell W. Hasan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)] - Controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 6, 2016, decision denying his request for a continuance and ordering him removed from the United States to Bangladesh. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including determinations as to credibility and the likelihood of future events, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, 677 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2012); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review all other issues under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have realized that his prior attorney was “a sub-standard immigration lawyer” because he filed the wrong form to seek a waiver of inadmissibility in March 2012, and suggests that she should have granted a continuance due to “hints of facts on the record for satisfying both 212(h) and 212(c) such that an Immigration Judge should be curious to see what evidence [the] respondent could introduce if given a further opportunity to do so” (Respondent’s Brief at 13-14).
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent has been in removal proceedings for more than 5 years, and has not submitted a valid application or evidence establishing his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under either section 212(c) or section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”) (I.J. at 1-3). Absent a showing of a readily available form of relief from removal, the Immigration Judge acted properly in ordering the respondent’s removal from the United States. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (noting that once the DHS institutes proceedings, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge). Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has not established good cause for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was denied a fair hearing.
 
*2 During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based upon his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Brief at 7-13). Specifically, the respondent notes that his former attorney failed to file the appropriate form to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility in March 2012, and never corrected this mistake by filing a valid application along with supporting evidence and a copy of the filing fee receipt (Respondent’s Brief at 7-13).
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that a motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. While the respondent submitted an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his former counsel, he provided no evidence that he notified his prior counsel of the specific allegations leveled against him or filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Consequently, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. See Zheng v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2005). Moreover, the respondent has offered no evidence that he would have prevailed if his prior attorney had been more effective in his representation or had filed a valid Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility (Form I-601). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice due to his former counsel’s actions or inactions. See Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005), citing United States v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 2001).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack E. Wallace, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charlotte S. Marquez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 19, 2015, denying her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order dated February 8, 1999. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing or was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.1 Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). Exceptional circumstances include serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion was untimely, as it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia order, and that the respondent did not establish that she acted with due diligence so as to warrant equitable tolling of the filing deadline (I.J. at 3-4). See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 343-44 (5th Cir. 2016) (requiring that an alien seeking equitable tolling show that she has been pursuing her rights diligently). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on October 30, 2015, more than 15 years after she was ordered removed. Moreover, although the respondent asserts that she diligently pursued her rights because she has maintained temporary protected status since 1999, the record reflects that the respondent waited approximately 6 years to file her motion to reopen after learning that she had been ordered removed in absentia, which demonstrates a lack of diligence in pursuing her rights (I.J. at 4; Motion to Reopen, Tab E). To the extent the respondent asserts that the actions of her former attorney prevented her from filing the motion sooner, she has not complied with the procedural requirements for setting forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006). Upon review, we agree that the motion was untimely and that equitable tolling of the time limit was unwarranted.
 
*2 The respondent also did not establish that exceptional circumstances prevented her appearance at her hearing. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (stating that the Board applies a totality of the circumstances test for determining whether exceptional circumstances prevented an alien’s appearance at a hearing). Considering the totality of the circumstances, including respondent’s claim that she was only in the United States for a few months before her hearing, that she had limited notice of the hearing date, and that she had difficulty obtaining transportation, we agree with the Immigration Judge that she did not demonstrate that her failure to appear at her hearing was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as contemplated in the Act (I.J. at 4).
 
Finally, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent has not provided evidence of circumstances that would justify the extraordinary remedy of reopening her removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g., Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: NORMA MURILLO RODRIGUEZ
File: AXXX XX6 150 - El Paso, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amber Weeks, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael Pleters
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 On August 31, 2016, the respondent submitted a “motion to reopen and reconsider” in proceedings in which the Board dismissed her appeal on August 26, 2014. The Board also granted a motion to reopen on January 9, 2015, for the limited purpose of reinstating voluntary departure. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s current motion. The motion will be denied.
 
Whether treated as a motion to reopen or one seeking reconsideration, the respondent’s motion is untimely filed, and as a motion to reopen it is also number-barred. Sections 240(c)(6), (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6), (7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b), (c)(2). The respondent, however, asks that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority, also citing Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337(5th Cir. 2016) as supporting equitable tolling of the statutory time limitation.
 
As the respondent essentially concedes, a significant amount of the information in her motion was available, and could have been, but was not, presented at the time of her hearing. The respondent repeatedly states that this error on the part of her former counsel, Ms. Kretz, did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, although she also describes her representation as “inadequate [and] lukewarm” (Motion at 2, 22). The respondent has not otherwise identified any extraordinary circumstances which prevented the timely filing of her motion. Rather, she alleges numerous errors on Ms. Kretz’s part in support of her motion (Motion at 22-25). The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge committed various errors in adjudicating her claim, none of which were addressed by prior counsel either during the proceedings below, or in a timely motion to reconsider (Motion at 25-30).
 
Given this record, the basis for the equitable tolling sought by the respondent is, in fact, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, she has not complied with any of the requirements for such a claim. Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644 (5th Cir. 2014); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, as she has not shown that this evidence was previously unavailable and could not have been presented at her hearing, it is also not new for purposes of reopening. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). The respondent’s choice to not comply with the requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an exceptional situation supporting either sua sponte reopening or reconsideration. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“As a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Therefore, we find that neither reopening nor reconsideration in this regard is warranted.
 
*2 The respondent also seeks to introduce evidence that post-dates her hearing relating to medical treatment for herself, her brother and mother, and evidence that her daughter was granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, among other evidence (Motion, Tabs O-AA). However, the acquisition of equities, both positive and negative, following an order of removal is a typical, rather than exceptional, situation. Id. In this regard we note that the mother’s most recent medical records indicate that her medical conditions were chronic, and there is no evidence that they first manifested after the respondent’s hearing (Motion, Tab O). These records also reflect that the respondent’s mother was no longer experiencing anxiety related to her brother’s death in March of 2016, and that her chronic conditions were either asymptomatic or controlled with medication. The respondent’s brother’s medical issues also predated her hearing (Motion, Tabs R, S).
 
We are not unsympathetic to any worsening of the respondent’s brother’s medical issues, and recognize the medical issues faced by the respondent. However, as noted, such issues are not uncommon when a respondent remains in the United States following an order of removal. Moreover, we note that neither the respondent nor her mother or brother have mentioned what assistance other family members could provide if she was removed to Mexico. (Motion, pgs. 131 (mentioning the respondent’s “sisters and their families”), 132-34 (letters from family members referencing multiple nieces and nephews)). As we find that the respondent has not shown an exceptional situation in this regard, we decline to exercise our authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Id.; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
In sum, the respondent has not demonstrated that her motion is, or should be, exempt from the noted statutory bars. As such, we find that neither reopening nor reconsideration is warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c) 97); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent does not contend that a statutory or regulatory exception to the time bar applies. Id. Nor does the respondent contend that the time limitation should be equitably tolled based on ineffective assistance of counsel.2
 
Rather, the respondent seeks either sua sponte reopening and administrative closure or sua sponte reopening and a remand for consideration of administrative closure or a continuance pending adjudication of his application for a U visa. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We decline to exercise our sua sponte discretionary authority to reopen proceedings because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority.
 
These proceedings need not be reopened for the respondent to pursue this application. The regulations provide exclusive jurisdiction over such applications to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and specifically address applications by U visa “petitioners” under final orders of removal, as is the case here. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). The filing of the application has no effect on the Government’s authority to execute a final order, but a petitioner “may file a request for stay of removal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a) and 8 C.F.R. § 1241.6(a).” See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). The respondent does not assert that the DHS is seeking his removal while his application is pending or that he has found it necessary to file a request for a stay of removal.
 
We have considered the respondent’s arguments about conserving judicial resources. In addition, we have considered the additional administrative resources that may be expended if we grant reopening but the respondent’s U visa is not granted by USCIS, as well as the additional judicial resources that may be expended if the respondent then decides to again pursue his petition for review with the Second Circuit, or files another petition for review. Weighing these factors, we find that there is no guarantee that judicial resources will be conserved, and that there may be additional expenditures related to additional administrative resources and judicial resources if this motion is granted. As such, conserving judicial resources is not a discretionary factor weighing in the respondent’s favor.
 
*2 The respondent relies on several unpublished Board decisions, but these decisions are not binding precedent. Further, each decision rests on its own facts and the records of proceedings, including the specific factual scenarios, of these unpublished decisions are not available for review. Moreover, the unpublished decisions on which the respondent relies involved timely motions (Motion, Exhs. G-H), had nothing to do with a U visa (Motion, Exh. I), or involved consideration of whether to reopen an in absentia order of removal issued against an unaccompanied minor (Motion, Exh. J).
 
The respondent’s reliance on Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012), is misplaced. In Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, the respondent requested a continuance during his merits hearing before the Immigration Judge because his U visa petition was still pending. Here, in contrast, the respondent did not seek a continuance until September 26, 2016, when he filed his untimely motion to reopen almost one year after the Board issued its final administrative order of removal. As such, Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, supra, does not apply.3
 
Considering the governing provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 214.14, the regulatory scheme addressing aliens with final orders who are pursuing U visas, and the circumstances presented in this case, we decline to exercise our discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen this proceeding. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

This proceeding has had a lengthy procedural history involving four prior Board decisions, three previous Immigration Judge decisions, and a pending petition for review that has been fully briefed.

2

The documents attached to the motion indicate that the respondent was a crime victim in 2011, that the respondent assisted in the criminal investigation soon thereafter, and that the criminal pled guilty in 2012. He does not explain why he waited until 2015 to obtain certification from the police and then file his U visa petition and related applications with USCIS. Nor does he explain why he waited over one year after submitting the U visa petition to file this current motion to reopen with the Board.

3

As noted in footnote 2, supra, the respondent does not explain the delay in filing this motion to reopen, or why he waited so long after the conviction and his victimization to obtain the required law enforcement certification or to pursue a U visa petition. The respondent does not claim that his attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel as to this delay. Nor has the respondent complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), or demonstrated due diligence in pursuing his U visa claim.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tatiana S. Aristova, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mary C. Lee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 8, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On September 20, 2016, more than 5 years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent argues that the motion to reopen time limitations should be equitably tolled in his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney James J. Orlow, who represented him and his former spouse in filing a Form I-130 visa petition with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in January 2010. Specifically, the respondent argues that attorney Orlow provided ineffective assistance by not filing (or by not advising the respondent to file) a motion to remand based on the pending visa petition, before the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent admits, and the documents submitted with the motion indicate, that attorney Orlow stopped representing the respondent or his former spouse in early 2011. The respondent argues that, after attorney Orlow stopped representing him, he had consulted with another attorney who passed away in September 2011, and then with still other unnamed attorney in the summer of 2012, but they were not able to help him (Motion Exh. C).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that an alien seeking the equitable tolling of the motion to reopen time limitations based on ineffective assistance of counsel must show due diligence “over the entire period for which tolling is desired.” Alzaarir v. Attorney General, 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011), citing Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252 (3d Cir. 2005) (finding that equitable tolling was not appropriate where due diligence was not shown). Although the respondent argues that he has consulted with other attorneys in 2011 and 2012 after attorney Orlow stopped representing him, the evidence submitted with the motion does not show that the respondent has exercised due diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim over the entire period for which equitable tolling is necessary. The respondent’s evidence also does not show that his motion to reopen would be deemed timely even if equitable tolling were applied. Accordingly, the motion will be denied as untimely.
 
*2 In any event, the respondent did not show that he was prejudiced by the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The Third Circuit has held that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice by showing that there was “reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different” but for the claimed error. Fadiga v. U.S. Attorney General, 488 F.3d 142, 158 (3d Cir. 2007). The respondent does not dispute that he and his former spouse started having material problems and the former spouse withdrew the Form I-130 visa petition on or about March 30, 2011 (see also DHS Opp. Exh. A). Therefore, at the time of the Board’s decision on April 8, 2011, there was no longer a pending visa petition that might have served as a basis for reopening or remand under Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). The respondent also does not argue that he would have been eligible for adjustment of status if his case were remanded in April 2011, as there was no long a pending or approved v isa petition at that time.
 
The respondent argues that he would have been able to request administrative closure of his case or favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion if his case were remanded. However, in the absence of a pending visa petition in April 2011, the respondent has not shown that there was a “reasonable likelihood” that his motion to remand under Matter of Velarde, supra, would have been granted in the first place. Furthermore, in the absence of a pending visa petition or available visa, the respondent has not shown that there was a “““reasonable likelihood” that his case would have been administratively closed under the applicable standard for administrative closure. As to the possibility of a request for favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion by the DHS, this is a matter within the authority of the DHS, not of the Board or the Immigration Judge. See, e.g., Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); Matter of Singh, 21 I&N Dec. 427, 435 (BIA 1996); Matter of Yazdani, 17 I&N Dec. 626, 630 (BIA 1981)2 Based on the above, the respondent did not show that his case warrants reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), based on his personal and family circumstances (including his 2016 marriage to another United States citizen and a pending Form I-130 visa petition filed by her) and the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

We also note that the respondent did not show that the scope of representation by attorney Orlow included these removal proceedings. The record in this case shows that the respondent was not represented by attorney Orlow at his hearing, but by a different attorney, who also represented the respondent on appeal until he withdrew from the respondent’s case in January 2010. The respondent states in his statement that “I believed that Mr. Orlow would do anything and everything necessary in order to have my status adjusted” (Motion Exh. C). The respondent also submitted a copy of Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney, submitted on January 2010 with the USCIS with his Form I-130 visa petition, which indicated that his appearance was in regard to immigration matters before: “USCIS” and listing “I-130/All Immigration Matters” (Motion Exh. H Tab C-4). However, this form only covers representation before the DHS, not before the Board or the Immigration Court, and was only limited to matters before the USCIS, which was and is not a party or an adjudicator in these removal proceedings. Despite the respondent’s assertion that he “believed” that attorney Orlow’s representation covered all of his immigration matters, he did not submit a copy of a retention agreement or a similar document showing the scope of representation by attorney Orlow.

We note that a request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion may be directed to the DHS.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jonathan Willmoth, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kimberly A. Burgess
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Cameron, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 9, 2016, denying him a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The respondent claims on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance to collaterally attack his conviction pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010).1 The respondent submitted evidence that he had filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea (Tr. at 9-10; Exh. A). Though the respondent has filed a post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction, it does not render the conviction non-final. We note that the respondent’s conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See section 101(a)(48)(A) of Immigration and Nationality Act; Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009). We point out that this Board and the federal courts have consistently held that an alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of an otherwise valid state or federal criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Ponce De Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; A.G. 1997); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Olivieri Gonzalez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen; remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 21, 2016, decision denying his untimely motion to reopen his proceedings. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was ordered removed on July 14, 2000, by an Immigration Judge (I.J. at 1). The respondent waived appeal (I.J. at 1). On June 29, 2016, approximately 16 years later, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge setting forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his attorney during his prior proceedings and arguing that the motions deadline for his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled (I.J. at 1-2). In particular, the respondent argued that, during his prior proceedings, his former attorney did not advise him of his eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and failed to apply for said relief on his behalf. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed the motion (I.J. at 1-2).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion as untimely (I.J. at 1). Specifically, the Immigration Judge found the respondent did not meet his burden in establishing an exception to the 90-day regulatory motions deadline applicable to his motion (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(i)-(iv). In regard to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Immigration Judge found the respondent did not show he exercised due diligence during the interstitial period after the motions deadline had passed, as required for equitable tolling to apply (I.J. at 1-2).
 
On appeal and through his motion to remand, the respondent argues his motion is subject to equitable tolling in light of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016). See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 7-10. According to the respondent, under Lugo-Resendez, he established that he exercised due diligence because he “has been pursuing his rights diligently.” See id. at 9. The respondent claims he could not timely file the motion to reopen because he relied on his prior attorney’s “defective” assurances that he did not qualify for any relief from removal. See id. The respondent further argues that his case presents “exceptional circumstances” such that he can invoke equitable tolling. See id. at 9-12. In this regard, the respondent contends that his prior attorney was not competent, neglected her duties, and “emphatically” failed to identify or apply for relief for which he qualified. See id. at 10. The respondent argues that her “mishandling” of his case resulted in a denial of due process and that this amounts to “exceptional circumstances” justifying the reopening of his case. See id. at 11.
 
*2 There is no dispute the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely inasmuch as it was filed approximately 16 years after the regulatory due date (I.J. at 1). Further, there is no dispute that the respondent complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for purposes of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 1). Given the totality of the circumstances in this case, including the respondent’s lengthy residence in the United States, most of which was spent as a lawful permanent resident; his United States citizen wife and mother who both suffer from health problems; his United States citizen children, one with autism; and, his employment history, coupled with his Lozada compliance, we find that reopening is warranted. See Respondent’s Brief at 12.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michelle Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Drucker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the October 14, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) on March 14, 2006, which included notice of a January 11, 2007, hearing; a subsequent notice of hearing (NOH) for a June 6, 2007, hearing was mailed on March 8, 2007, to the respondent at the Florida address she provided and which is contained in the NTA, but the NOH was returned as undeliverable marked “““unclaimed, unable to forward” (I.J. at 1-2; Exhs. 1, 2). The respondent failed to appear at her June 6, 2007, hearing, and an in absentia order was properly entered against her.
 
Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. The record reflects that the NOH was mailed to the respondent at the address she provided. Due process was satisfied here because the method of service was reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reached the alien. See Dominguez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002) (notice of a removal hearing satisfies due process so long as the method of notice is conducted in a manner reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reaches the alien).
 
In the respondent’s motion to reopen, she admitted that she moved to California two months after being served the NTA, but she does not indicate that she filed a change of address with the Immigration Court. The duty to provide the immigration court with an updated address attached upon personal service of the NTA upon the respondent. See Matter of Anyelo, 25 I&N Dec. 337, 338-39 (BIA 2010). The respondent did not provide a change of address pursuant to this known duty until she filed her motion to reopen in 2015, over eight years after her removal hearing, and is therefore precluded from claiming that she did not receive notice. See Dominguez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1260 (“[N]otice [mailed] to the alien at the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice” for in absentia removal). Because the immigration court properly mailed the NOH to the most recent address provided by the respondent at the Florida address listed on the NTA, she could not rely on the fact that the NOH was returned by the Postal Service as undeliverable.
 
*2 We find without merit the respondent’s appellate contention that the Immigration Judge erred in denying sua sponte reopening. Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While the respondent has presented some positive factors, these factors either individually or in the aggregate are not so exceptional as to trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Indeed, many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances).
 
In addition, while the respondent argues that she was misled by a notario in 2007, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent has not identified the notario, she has not averred that the notario held himself out as an attorney, and she has not shown that she filed a complaint with the relevant state disciplinary agency (I.J. at 2). See generally Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2008) (suggesting that Lozada applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims rendered by non-attorneys). Moreover, contrary to the respondent’s appellate contention, she has not adequately established diligence in filing the motion to reopen, despite having personally received and signed the NTA (I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 1).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 29, 2002, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a brief. This motion, submitted on May 27, 2016, is untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent contends that reopening is warranted due to ineffective assistance of prior counsel. To support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The alien must also show that he was prejudiced by the prior counsel’s deficient representation. Id. at 640. Additionally, to establish that equitable tolling of the deadline for motions to reopen is warranted, the alien must show that he pursued his rights with reasonable diligence, and that some extraordinary circumstance beyond his control prevented timely filing. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
Equitable tolling is not warranted in this case because the respondent did not demonstrate that he exercised due diligence. The respondent was ordered removed in 1999 and his appeal was summarily dismissed in 2002. However, the evidence submitted with the motion indicates that the respondent did not inform his prior counsel of his grievances until September 1, 2015, and did not file this motion until May 27, 2016 (Respondent’s Motion, Tab F). The respondent has not explained this 13-year delay.
 
Because equitable tolling of the time limits is not warranted, the respondent’s motion is untimely. Further, the DHS’s records indicate that the respondent was removed from the United States on March 8, 2011 (DHS Opposition to Motion). Thus, the departure bar divests us of jurisdiction to consider his motion sua sponte. See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 295-97 (5th Cir. 2009); Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008); see also Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, supra, at 342-44 (holding that if an alien is entitled to equitable tolling of the time limitations for a motion to reopen, the motion is a timely statutory motion not subject to the departure bar, as opposed to a regulatory motion to sua sponte reopen that is subject to the departure bar). Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied as untimely.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Russia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 8, 2016, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has submitted a response in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On August 30, 2012, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, allowing the respondent to leave the United States voluntarily on or before December 28, 2012, before an alternate order of removal would attach. The respondent did not leave the United States during the voluntary departure period (I.J. at 1). On February 1, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in order for the Immigration Court to reopen and terminate her case because she alleges that she is not subject to removal as charged in the Notice to Appear (“NTA”), or alternatively, to rescind her voluntary departure order and issue an alternative order of removal. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, and the respondent appealed the denial. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for reopening because the respondent was given numerous continuances to await the adjudication of different Alien Relative Petitions (Form I-130) filed on her behalf by different United States citizen spouses (I.J. at 1). Moreover, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s prior counsel was not ineffective in seeking voluntary departure because the respondent was not eligible for any other relief (I.J. at 1). Finally, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent is barred from adjustment of status for not having departed the United States under the voluntary departure order (I.J. at 1).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that neither her prior counsel nor the Immigration Judge advised her of the consequences of failing to depart under a voluntary departure order (Respondent’s Brief at 6). Additionally, she alleges that but for her prior counsel’s ineffective assistance, she would be eligible to apply for adjustment of status with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) as an arriving alien (Respondent’s Brief at 6-9).
 
*2 There is no dispute that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. Furthermore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the voluntary departure admonishments were provided to the respondent in the decision dated August 30, 2012 (I.J. at 1). See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). In regards to her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during her removal proceedings, the respondent did not demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s actions (I.J. at 1). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638-40 (BIA 1988) (explaining that in order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that she was prejudiced by her counsel’s performance). At the time of the August 30, 2012, hearing, the respondent had divorced her second husband who had filed the second, now revoked, petition on her behalf. The second visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent was revoked pursuant to the bar under section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c), which also bars approval of all future visa petitions filed on her behalf. Thus, the respondent did not make a prima facie showing that she was eligible for adjustment of status or any other type of relief, except for voluntary departure (I.J. at 1).
 
The respondent on appeal asserts that but for her prior counsel’s ineffective assistance, she would be eligible to apply for adjustment of status (Respondent’s Brief at 6-9). However, we note that during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent’s third visa petition filed on February 19, 2016, by her third and current husband has been denied (Respondent’s Brief at 5). The respondent is therefore not eligible for adjustment of status, which is the relief that she seeks. See Mansour v. INS, 230 F.3d 902, 907 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that a motion to reopen will be denied if the alien fails to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, fails to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence, or is not entitled to the grant of relief which he sought); Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 258 (BIA 2007) (same).
 
Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. Because the respondent did not leave the United States voluntarily by December 28, 2012, her order of pre-conclusion voluntary departure was terminated and the alternative order of removal to Russia went into effect (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(d), (e)(2). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerald Karikari, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination; administrative closure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 8, 2015, decision denying his motion to terminate proceedings and ordering him removed to Ecuador. In the alternative, the respondent requests that we exercise our authority to administratively close proceedings, or remand the record to the Immigration Judge to terminate or administratively close proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the appeal, the request for administrative closure, or the motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed. The request for administrative closure and motion to remand will be denied.1
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On May 26, 2015, the respondent submitted written pleadings admitting to the allegations and conceding that he is subject to removal as set forth in the Notice to Appear (Exhs. 1 and 2). Based on the respondent’s admissions and concessions, the Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged (I.J. at 1, 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). On September 8, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to terminate in which he argued that an order of removal would violate his constitutional rights (Respondent’s Motion to Terminate at 2, 4-12). On that same date, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate (I.J. at 2-3).
 
On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, alleges that the Immigration Judge failed to provide a basis for denying the respondent’s motion to terminate other than the DHS’s opposition to the motion (Respondent’s Brief at 6). Accordingly, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge did not make an informed adjudication of the motion (Respondent’s Brief at 6). However, the record does not support the allegations of the respondent’s counsel (I.J. at 2-3). Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505-06 (BIA 1980) (finding that uncorroborated declarations of counsel are not evidence).
 
The Immigration Judge does not reference the DHS’s opposition position as a basis for denying the respondent’s motion to terminate (I.J. at 2-3). Rather, the Immigration Judge’s decision reflects that he considered the respondent’s arguments (I.J. at 2-3). The Immigration Judge, however, declined to reach the constitutional issues raised by the respondent and dismissed his argument that the Immigration and Nationality Act requires a proportionality review before an order of removal can be entered (I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s Motion to Terminate at 2, 4-12). See Matter of Yanez, 23 I&N Dec. 390 (BIA 2002). As the respondent does not otherwise challenge this determination, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to terminate. See Matter of J-S-, 24 I&N Dec. 520, 526 n.4 (A.G. 2008) (declining to address determinations not challenged on appeal).
 
*2 For the first time on appeal, the respondent argues that proceedings should be terminated so that he may pursue a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Form I-601A) before United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) as part of his application for consular processing based on an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed on his behalf by his United States citizen wife (Respondent’s Brief at 5-9). See generally 8 C.F.R. § 212(e)(7). We disagree.
 
The authority to terminate removal proceedings is limited by regulation to a few narrow circumstances not applicable here. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1238.1(e), 1239.2(f), 1240.10(d); cf. Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378, 1380 (BIA 2000) (requiring termination where no charge of removability is sustained). Here, the DHS did not agree to terminate proceedings and the Immigration Judge found that removability has been established by the respondent’s admissions and concessions (I.J. at 1, 3; Tr. at 17, Exh. 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). Accordingly, termination of these proceedings is not appropriate.
 
In the alternative, the respondent requests that we administratively close proceedings or remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider administrative closure based on his prima facie eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Respondent’s Brief at 7-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(v). In evaluating whether administrative closure is appropriate, we consider, among other things, the reason administrative closure is sought, the likelihood the applicant will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he is pursuing outside of removal proceedings, and the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012). Administrative closure is not appropriate for a purely speculative event or action, such as the approval of an application for which prima facie eligibility has not been established. Id.
 
To support his request for administrative closure on appeal, the respondent proffers evidence of his eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(3) (Respondent’s Brief at Tabs A-D, G). However this evidence was not provided to the Immigration Judge and the Board does not consider new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984). As the respondent has not established that he is prima facie eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility, we are not persuaded to exercise our authority to administratively close proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, supra.
 
*3 Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that proceedings should be remanded for the Immigration Judge to consider administratively closing proceedings based on the proffered evidence (Respondent’s Brief at 8-9). “A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen and will only be granted if the evidence was previously unavailable and would likely change the result in the case.” Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015) (citing Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992)).
 
However, the respondent has not established that the documents attached to his appeal were previously unavailable (Respondent’s Brief at 8-9). Rather, the proffered evidence pre-dates the Immigration Judge’s September 8, 2015, decision (Respondent’s Brief at Tabs A-D, G). Moreover, while the respondent concedes that his prior counsel did not submit this evidence to the Immigration Judge or request administrative closure based on a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility, he does not allege ineffective assistance of counsel or present evidence which meets the procedural requirements for such a claim. (Respondent’s Brief at 5, 9). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2007) (requiring substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to remand will also be denied.
 
Lastly, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s due process arguments raised on appeal. In particular, he asserts that the Immigration Judge violated his due process rights by failing to advise him of his right to request that proceedings be administratively closed based on his eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Respondent’s Brief at 9-10). To establish a due process violation, the respondent must show that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See section 240(b)(4) of the Act. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4); Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270-71 (2d Cir. 2008). He must also show prejudice, which means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation. See Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511, 518 (2d Cir. 1993) (requiring that prejudice be established to prevail on a due process claim). On appeal, the respondent has not alleged that the Immigration Judge prevented him from reasonably presenting his case, nor has he articulated how the outcome of the proceeding might have been affected by the Immigration Judge’s inaction (Respondent’s Brief at 9-10). Thus, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge violated his due process rights.
 
*4 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to administratively close is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan M. Saborio, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kimberly Hillery
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals an Immigration Judge’s July 19, 2016, order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
The record reflects that on May 15, 2006, the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served on the respondent by regular mail (Exh. 1). The record contains a Notice of Hearing (NOH) for a “March 14, 2006,” hearing, which reflects that it was personally served on the respondent on January 17, 2007 (Exh. 5). The respondent filed a motion to reopen on June 23, 2016, asserting that she was the victim of fraud by a notary insofar as when she received notices, she took them to the notary office and was told they would take care of the process. The respondent further alleges that she never received any in absentia order. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s motion alleging exceptional circumstances was not timely filed and the respondent did not establish due diligence in filing her motion to reopen.
 
We note some record irregularities which are not addressed by the Immigration Judge and for which remand is warranted. First, while the NOH reflects that it was personally served on the respondent on January 17, 2007, the record indicates that the respondent was granted a continuance of the January 17, 2007, hearing due to illness. In addition, the NOH contains an incorrect hearing date of March 14, 2006, when the in absentia order was entered on March 14, 2007. We also observe that the March 14, 2007, in absentia order does not contain a certificate of service and the Immigration Judge did not address the respondent’s assertion that she did not receive any in absentia order. Consequently, we find it appropriate to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge for further fact-finding to determine whether the respondent received adequate notice in these proceedings, and to further address the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by a notary. See Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001).
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ignatius Udeani, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura W. Trosen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to suppress evidence; termination
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to suppress evidence and terminate removal proceedings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including issues of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to suppress. Further, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to allow him to amend his pleadings.
 
Regarding the respondent’s challenge of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request to amend pleadings, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c), reads that an Immigration Judge shall require the respondent to plead to the Notice to Appear (NTA), Form I-862, and, if the Immigration Judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain, the Immigration Judge may determine that removability has been established by the admissions of the respondent. In this matter, on September 16, 2014, the respondent admitted through counsel all the factual allegations on the NTA and conceded the charge of removability (Tr. at 4). Nevertheless, at the respondent’s subsequent master calendar hearing held on September 22, 2015, the respondent through new counsel, sought to withdraw his pleadings. The respondent did not assert that the facts, as previously admitted, were incorrect. Rather, the respondent asserted before the Immigration Judge that he wished to file a motion to suppress the evidence as the information relating to his removability was obtained as a result of an unlawful detention, interrogation, and seizure. Also, the respondent suggested that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsel as she did not discuss with him the charges of removability and manner in which he was apprehended by immigration officials (Tr. at 12).
 
We concur with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request to amend his pleadings. The respondent has not shown that he was ineffectively represented or complied with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not shown egregious circumstances warranting the amendment of his pleadings. The respondent does not assert that the pleadings provided by his initial attorney were a result of coercion or duress or that the charges and factual allegation in the NTA are inaccurate. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (“Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission.”). Accordingly, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to amend his pleadings. See Perez-Mejia v. Holder, 641 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
*2 Regarding the respondent’s motion to suppress, in a written decision dated December 2, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to suppress the evidence of his inadmissibility obtained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. In an order dated January 12, 2016, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ordered him removed to Honduras. The “exclusionary rule,” which requires a court to suppress evidence that is the fruit of an unlawful arrest or of other official conduct which violates the Fourth Amendment, arose in the context of criminal proceedings. It is well-established that the exclusionary rule is generally not applicable in deportation (or removal) proceedings. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984). The Supreme Court, however, has warned that egregious violations of Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained may justify use of the exclusionary rule. Id. at 1050-51. In expressing reluctance to apply the exclusionary rule in the deportation context, the Supreme Court balanced the likely social benefits of excluding unlawfully seized evidence against the likely costs. Id. at 1050; see Lopez-Fernandez v. Holder, 735 F.3d 1043, 1046 (8th Cir. 2013).
 
In particular, the Supreme Court reasoned that the deterrent value of the exclusionary rule is low due to the availability of alternative deportation procedures, while the social cost is high because courts would be compelled to suppress reliable evidence and then “release from custody persons who would then immediately resume their commission of a crime through their continuing, unlawful presence in this country.” See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra, at 1050; Lopez-Fernandez v. Holder, supra, at 1046. “Even the objective of deterring Fourth Amendment violations should not require such a result.” See Lopez Fernandez v. Holder, supra, at 1046. In Lopez-Gabriel v. Holder, 653 F.3d 683, 686 (8th Cir. 2011), the Eighth Circuit in which this case arises noted that the case for exclusion of evidence is even weaker where the alleged misconduct was committed by an agent of a separate sovereign. The court found that if evidence were suppressed in a federal civil immigration proceeding, any deterrent effect on a local police officer would be highly attenuated. See Lopez-Gabriel v. Holder, supra, at 686; citing United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433, 457-58 (1976). The Eighth Circuit has not developed “an exhaustive list of the conduct that could constitute an egregious constitutional violation,” but looks at the totality of the circumstances. See Lopez-Fernandez v. Holder, supra, at 1047.
 
*3 In the present case, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion for suppression because the respondent’s motion did not establish a prima facie case of an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment. The respondent claimed in his motion that he was questioned, arrested, and detained by the police and ICE because of his race. However, the respondent did not offer any facts or evidence to support his assumption that he was questioned and detained based on his race. The respondent does not describe any unreasonable show or use of force, or any otherwise egregious conduct during his questioning and arrest by the police. As the record does not contain any evidence to corroborate the respondent’s assertion that he was questioned and arrested based on his race, we conclude that the Immigration Judge was correct in denying the respondent’s motion to suppress evidence. See Lopez-Gabriel v. Holder, supra, at 686-87 (evidence of police officer’s alleged egregious violation during a traffic stop of Guatemalan alien was insufficient to warrant a hearing on the alien’s motion to suppress, which was filed during removal proceedings: no facts supported the alien’s assumption that he was stopped and arrested based on his Hispanic appearance, and the unrebutted police report declared that the officer stopped the alien for driving with a heavily cracked windshield and arrested him for lack of proper identification). On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution in this matter.
 
Finally, the record reflects that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Hence, the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
*4 WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos Alberto Quichiz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William C. Padish
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 18, 2016, denying his request for a continuance but granted him the privilege of voluntary departure. The respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have filed briefs on appeal, which we have considered in adjudicating the respondent’s appeal. We will dismiss his appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent argues that he is eligible to renew his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) claim based upon exceptional circumstances.1 Specifically, the respondent claims that his criminal attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his guilty plea that resulted in a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) in 2014. (Resp. Br. at 1-3, 5-8). In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s speculation that his 2014 conviction might be invalid does not change its finality for immigration purposes, unless and until it were to be overturned by the criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). We have received no indication that the respondent’s conviction has been expunged, vacated or otherwise materially amended, and therefore the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance has compromised the fairness of his removal proceedings.
 
Moreover, on October 14, 2015, the Immigration Judge continued the respondent’s case for the DHS to adjudicate his renewed DACA request based upon exceptional circumstances. On May 18, 2016, the respondent conceded that his DACA application had been denied by the DHS (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 6-7, 11-12). The DHS also denied the respondent’s request for prosecutorial discretion (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 14). We agree with the Immigration Judge that a second continuance was not warranted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that a continuance should not be granted where it is being sought “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”). We also find that he has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice. Long-Gang Lin v. Holder, 630 F.3d 536 (7th Cir. 2010).
 
*2 To the extent the respondent contemplates applying for adjustment of status through his girlfriend, he has not provided any evidence of prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status through this individual. See Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 791 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that a continuance may be warranted where an alien has established, among other things, that he is the beneficiary of a currently pending petition and established a likelihood of success on the merits of an application for adjustment of status).
 
Moreover, we are unable to reinstate voluntary departure in this case. The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the required advisals and granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a $500 bond (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 14-16). The record before the Board, however, does not reflect that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid that bond. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3); see Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). Therefore, the voluntary departure period will not be reinstated, and the respondent is subject to removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States to Mexico, pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.

An alien’s desire to seek deferred action, which is a form of prosecutorial discretion, does not warrant a remand of these proceedings as the decision to grant an alien deferred action lies with the exclusive jurisdiction of the DHS. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 106-110 (BIA 2009); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter J. Musser, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert B. Wities
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary Departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated November 20, 2015, denying as a matter of discretion his request for voluntary departure under the provisions of section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), and ordering his removal from the United States.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but use a de novo standard of review for questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and for all other issues that may arise in an appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision and dismiss the appeal. The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with a fundamentally fair hearing wherein he was able to offer testimony in support of his application for voluntary departure.1 During that testimony, the respondent admitted that he previously had been apprehended by immigration officials and allowed to voluntarily return to Mexico (Tr. at 28). The respondent admitted that this occurred as many as eight times, most recently in 2010 (Tr. at 28, 36). He also did not immediately agree that if his application for voluntary departure were granted, he would stay in Mexico (Tr. at 34). Considering this, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that, upon a balancing of the appropriate factors, the respondent has not established that he warrants voluntary departure as a matter of discretion (I.J at 3-4). See section 240(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(ii); Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999); Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972).
 
To the extent that, on appeal, the respondent suggests that his prior voluntary returns were not conducted under sufficient procedural requirements to comply with Matter of Garcia-Ramirez, 26 I&N Dec. 674 (BIA 2015), we find this argument unavailing. See Respondent’s Brief at 4. The respondent admitted in his testimony that on multiple occasions, he departed the United States after being confronted by immigration officials about his unlawful presence, and that he thereafter unlawfully reentered the United States (Tr. at 28-36). The Immigration Judge accepted this testimony as credible and considered it in his overall analysis of whether the respondent was deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion on his application for voluntary departure. Since the respondent himself equivocated when asked if he would remain in Mexico (as would be a required condition of him accepting voluntary departure), it is clear that, regardless of the process afforded during his many voluntary returns, he did not show that he would abide by the conditions of voluntary departure. As such, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that a grant of relief in the exercise of discretion was not warranted since the record reflects the respondent’s repeated disregard for this country’s immigration laws. Matter of Arguelles-Campos, supra. We also find inadequate basis on this record to remand this record to permit the respondent to pursue a second application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, given that an application for relief on this basis already has been denied.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent admitted through counsel that he did not have the requisite 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States to qualify for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act (Tr. at 20). To the extent that he suggests otherwise on appeal, he has not argued that counsel’s admission in this regard was incorrect or that it constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose E. Perez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2015, denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen to seek a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS filed a reply to the motion1 but has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
“A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Here, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as the respondent did not establish that the evidence to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F. R 100.23(b)(3).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that he was not adequately advised to request DHS to exercise its prosecutorial discretion (Respondent’s Brief, page 8-9). Here, the respondent was represented by counsel at his hearings and a Spanish interpreter was provided. The respondent is bound by the tactical decisions of his counsel. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Nor has the respondent alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent maintains that he is eligible for relief through his United States citizen (USC) children, in anticipation of the implementation of an executive order deferring removal for parents of United States citizens or lawful permanent residents (DAPA) (Respondent’s Brief, page 6-7). If the respondent believes that he should be permitted to remain in the United States in order to apply for benefits under the yet-to-be implemented DAPA program, he is not precluded from requesting a stay of removal from the DHS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6.
 
To the extent the respondent alleges Immigration Judge error in not advising him of the DAPA program, we find no merit. In order to establish a denial of the right to due process, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s actions. See Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (“Parties claiming denial of due process in immigration cases must, in order to prevail, allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process”). Specifically, we note that on June 23, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States decided United States v. Texas, 579 U.S. ____; 136 S.Ct. 2271 (2016). That decision upheld the injunction previously entered against implementation of the DAPA program. In addition, as deferred action does not affect an alien’s removability, or his eligibility for relief from removal, the filing for prosecutorial discretion benefits does not warrant administrative closure of removal proceedings. Moreover, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is not within the jurisdiction of the Immigration Judge or this Board, but may only be exercised by the DHS. See, e.g., Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); Matter of Singh, 21 I&N Dec. 427, 435 (BIA 1996); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982) (addressing the Board’s lack of authority to grant or review the denial of deferred action status).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The reply indicates that DHS is “opposed” to the motion, but the narrative portion indicates “DHS would not oppose reopening” given the respondent’s lengthy residence and 2 United States children.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey Kyle McClain, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 22, 2015, denying his motion for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including issues of law, judgment or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge denial of his motion to continue. Also, the respondent argues that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsel and seeks to remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance of his removal proceedings. The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6.
 
In the instant case, on January 13, 2014, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a continuance of nearly two years for attorney preparation. At a hearing held on December 22, 2015, the respondent sought an additional continuance in order to petition the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) for prosecutorial discretion and to provide DHS with certified dispositions of his criminal record (Tr. at 9). However, we note that the DHS attorney specifically stated at the hearing, when asked for his position with regard to the respondent’s intention to seek prosecutorial discretion that he would not agree to a continuance or a request for prosecutorial discretion as the respondent had approximately two years to seek such relief and failed to do so (Tr. at 10-11). We observe that neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982) (stating that deferred action status is a function of DHS’s prosecutorial discretion). Furthermore, we note that the DHS may choose to exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of the respondent’s proceedings. On this record, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance.
 
*2 Regarding the respondent’s motion for remand of proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel, we will deny such motion. The respondent has not sufficiently complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2007); Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996).1 Furthermore, the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not prevail as he has not established prejudice. The record does not reflect that the alleged ineffective representation of the respondent’s former counsel affected the final outcome of the respondent’s removal hearing. The respondent made no application for relief other than voluntary departure, which the DHS did not oppose, and the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to continue. See Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that an alien should not be granted a continuance “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”). To date, the respondent has not provided any evidence to show that he is eligible for any other relief from removal. See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857 (6th Cir. 2006) (successful motion by alien to reopen immigration proceedings due to ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board must meet the Matter of Lozada requirements, and the alien must show that he was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel); Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2001) (stating that the alien carries the burden of establishing that ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him or denied him fundamental fairness in order to prove that he has suffered denial of due process); Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717 (6th Cir. 2003) (the alien will succeed on an ineffective of assistance of counsel claim in deportation proceedings if he meets his burden of showing more than mere ineffective assistance of counsel, but assistance which was so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause).
 
Finally, the record reflects that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Hence, the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*3 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.260).

In Matter of Rivera-Claros, supra, we held that an alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based on her unsuccessful communications with her attorney did not establish exceptional circumstances pursuant to former section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, where she failed to satisfy all of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set out in Matter of Lozada. The applicant in Matter of Rivera-Claros declined to file a bar complaint against her former attorney and the Board found the applicant’s explanation to be inadequate under Lozada. Id. at 603. The Board addressed the importance of the “bar complaint” and provided numerous justifications for its requirement. Id. at 605. Specifically, the Board relies on the disciplinary process of the relevant jurisdiction’s bar as the first, and ordinarily the fastest, means of identifying and correcting possible misconduct. Id. at 604. As the Board stated in Matter of Lozada, this process not only serves to deter meritless claims of ineffective assistance of counsel but also highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent aliens in immigration proceedings. Id. at 604. The filing of the complaint also increases our confidence in the validity of the particular claim, protects against collusion between the alien and counsel, and helps to prevent unnecessary delay in immigration proceedings, including by reducing the need for an evidentiary hearing on matters that are collateral to the merits of substantive immigration law determinations. Id. at 604-05.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Noemi C. Simbron, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s June 23, 2016, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed an opposition to the motion. The respondent’s proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on October 9, 2015, after failing to appear for his hearing scheduled on August 25, 2015 (I.J. Decision of October 9, 2015). On March 24, 2016, the respondent’s former attorney filed a motion to reopen proceedings alleging notice was not properly served. In a decision dated March 30, 2016, the Immigration Judge issued a decision denying the motion. On April 26, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider, noting that the Immigration Judge had not considered a filing submitted on March 31, 2016, and alleging additional grounds for reopening. On May 5, 2016, the Immigration Judge issued a new decision, acknowledging the respondent’s filing that was received on March 31, 2016, and denying the motion to reconsider and reopen.
 
On June 9, 2016, the respondent filed a new motion to reopen proceedings, filed with a new attorney, alleging he had received ineffective assistance of counsel, which had caused the original in absentia order on October 9, 2015. On June 23, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied this latest motion, finding ineffective assistance of counsel was not established. Specifically, the respondent argued that his former counsel had failed to keep the Immigration Court apprised of his changing office addresses, and therefore, had not received notice of the respondent’s hearing. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not established that his former counsel had not received notice of the hearings, and therefore, had not committed ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In this instance, under the totality of the circumstances, we find that reopening is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We note that in the several motions the respondent’s former attorney filed on the respondent’s behalf, he presents no argument that he attempted to communicate the receipt of hearing notices, or lack thereof, to the respondent. The respondent, on the contrary, submitted evidence that he maintained communication with his former attorney during the period of time when the hearing notices would have been mailed (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). We additionally note, as the Immigration Judge did in her March 30, 2016, decision, that the respondent’s former counsel did not have his most recent office address on file with the Immigration Court and that he (the former counsel) incorrectly argued that the hearing notice should have been sent directly to the respondent instead of to the respondent’s counsel of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (concluding that the mailing of notice of a removal proceeding date to the alien’s attorney of record at the correct address constitutes notice to the alien).
 
*2 In light of the evidence of some misconduct by the respondent’s former attorney, we find reopening for a hearing is warranted in this case. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s in absentia order of removal is rescinded, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jessica Rodriguez-Bell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Morris I. Onyewuchi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 12, 2015, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asks that the decision below be summarily affirmed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case, and find that reopening is warranted to allow the respondent an opportunity to apply for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Further, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was properly served. Further, the respondent’s failure to name the attorney accused of ineffective assistance of counsel made it impossible for the Immigration Judge to evaluate the substance of her ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Dec. at 2-4). See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
However, we note that the respondent was granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under section 244 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254a and appears to have renewed that status regularly before DHS. Thus, reopening is appropriate. Upon remand, the respondent shall have the opportunity to seek administrative closure or any other relief for which she may be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s November 17, 2015, decision ordering him removed from the United States to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
On July 14, 2015, the respondent admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability (Tr. at 1). The respondent’s attorney requested several continuances to try to obtain agreement with the DHS to terminate or administratively close the proceedings because he had an approved immediate relative petition and was pursuing a provisional unlawful presence waiver from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (Tr. at 6-7, 13, 15-17). At a hearing on November 17, 2015, the DHS stated that it would not agree to administrative closure because the respondent is not eligible for a provisional waiver based on his forgery conviction (Tr. at 17). The Immigration Judge stated that he would not grant administrative closure over the DHS’s objection and allowed the respondent’s attorney time off the record to talk to the respondent about either accepting a voluntary departure order or a removal order (Tr. at 19). After consulting with the respondent off the record, the respondent’s attorney stated that the respondent would accept an order of removal and would waive appeal (Tr. at 19).
 
The respondent alleges on appeal that his acceptance of a removal order and waiver of appeal was not knowing and voluntary. He states that his attorney advised him to accept a removal order so that he could appeal the decision and that he told the attorney that he wanted to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision. He further argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance by waiving his right to appeal, by improperly advising him to plead guilty to forgery, by failing to file for cancellation of removal and failing to pursue parole and a provisional waiver with the DHS.
 
We conclude that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and has stated a valid claim of ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006). Further, we find that the respondent’s waiver of appeal was not knowing and intelligent. See Narine v. Holder, 559 F.3d 246 (4th Cir. 2009). He states in his affidavit that he told his attorney he wanted to accept a removal order so that he would not have to waive his appeal rights, and he was not aware that his former attorney told the Immigration Judge that he agreed to waive his right to appeal (Tr. at 19). In addition, his former attorney has filed an affidavit stating that he mistakenly waived the respondent’s appeal rights and that the respondent did not intend to do so. Thus, we accept the respondent’s appeal on certification.
 
*2 The respondent has raised a claim on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have granted his request for administrative closure to allow for processing of his immigrant visa petition and to allow him to pursue a provisional waiver of unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9). The DHS opposed administrative closure on the grounds that the respondent has a forgery conviction and is not eligible for a provisional waiver (Tr. at 17-18).
 
Therefore, we will remand these proceedings for the parties to be given an opportunity to present further evidence regarding the respondent’s eligibility for administrative closure, and for the Immigration Judge to make findings of fact regarding the respondent’s conviction or analyze his request for administrative closure under the standards outlined in Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the issuance of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alanna M. McCoy, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 9, 2016, denying her motion to reopen and to terminate proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the Immigration Judge’s determination of credibility. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed on August 4, 2010. On April 21, 2016, she filed a motion requesting sua sponte reopening and termination of her proceedings to allow her to return to El Salvador and apply for the Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program. The Immigration Judge denied the motion and this appeal followed.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that the Immigration Judge erred by declining to sua sponte reopen her case. Specifically, the respondent claims that exceptional circumstances apply because (1) the program under which she seeks to apply did not exist at the time she accepted her order of removal and (2) she was young at the time she accepted her order of removal and her attorney did not seek to file relief.2 She further contends that without reopening and termination of these proceedings, she is ineligible for the CAM program.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s case does not warrant sua sponte reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Sua sponte reopening of proceedings is invoked sparingly and reserved for truly exceptional circumstances. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-35 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship). While the respondent has presented sympathetic circumstances, her circumstances are not sufficiently different from ordinary hardship so as to qualify as exceptional and trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
*2 Moreover, the Immigration Judge properly noted that neither the Immigration Court nor the Board have jurisdiction to adjudicate the respondent’s application. We have concluded that administratively final removal proceedings should not be reopened for matters over which neither the Immigration Judge, nor the Board, has jurisdiction. Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009). We thus affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JIAN WANG
File: AXXX XX5 735 - New York, New York
November 3, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Theodore Cox, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of China, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s May 12, 2016, decision which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The respondent entered the United States on a visitor’s visa in 1999. The Notice to Appear was mailed on January 4, 2007, to the address contained therein: 136 15 41st Avenue, #7D, Flushing, New York 11355 (Exh. 1). This was the address that also appeared in the Form I-213 (Exh. 4). On January 9, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was mailed to the same address informing him of a hearing scheduled for January 31, 2007 (Exh. 2). It was not returned by the Postal Service. The respondent failed to appear. On March 23, 2007, another Notice of Hearing informing him of a hearing scheduled for April 19, 2007, was mailed to the same address (Exh. 3).1 It was not returned by the Postal Service.
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on April 19, 2007, at which the respondent failed to appear and the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service presented evidence, the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b.
 
On February 5, 2016, the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. He claimed that he had retained an immigration agency in 2001 to file an adjustment application on his behalf, and that he did not receive the hearing notices because the agency allegedly forged his signature, and used a false address (the Flushing, New York, address as well as another address in Dallas, Texas) without his knowledge or consent.2 He indicated in an attached affidavit that he learned that the agency was a “scam” from other aliens waiting outside of the office in 2006 and that he “sort of gave up my case.” The respondent did not indicate what actions, if any, he initiated to resolve his immigration status between 2006 and 2010. He married in 2010, and, between 2010 and 2014, he alleged that he was “awaiting the result of my wife’s immigration case,” which resulted in her being granted withholding of removal in November 2014. Finally, the respondent stated that he retained an attorney in December 2014 who requested a copy of his immigration proceeding, that he received a copy of the file in May 2015, and that he retained his current attorney in September 2015.
 
*2 A presumption of adequate notice attaches when notice is properly mailed to an address provided by the alien. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) (presumption of delivery arises when hearing notice is properly addressed and sent by regular mail). In addition, an alien need not actually receive notice of a hearing to satisfy the notice requirements of due process. Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540, 542 (BIA 2002) (alien can be charged with having received Notice to Appear and notice of hearing even when they are returned as “unclaimed” by postal service). In the analogous situation involving the mailing of a Notice to Appear, an alien may be deemed to have received it even if she did not personally receive, read, and understand the Notice to Appear when it “reaches the correct address but does not reach the alien through some failure in the internal workings of the household.” Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001). In such a case, “the alien can be charged with receiving proper notice, and proper service will have been effected.” Id. If an alien does not fulfill his obligation to report his address change, notice of the hearing is not required pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). The respondent failed to establish lack of proper notice, or the existence of exceptional circumstances, to merit reopening (I.J. at 3-4). He has not established lack of notice because the hearing notice for the April 19, 2007, hearing was mailed to his last known address of record, which appeared in both the Form I-213, and the Notice to Appear (I.J. at 2). In addition, the mail sent to the Flushing, New York, address was not returned by the Postal Service. See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (presumption of regularity that public officers, in absence of clear contrary evidence, have properly discharged their duties); Matter of Rodriguez, 13 I&N Dec. 746, 748 (BIA 1971) (discussing presumption of official regularity). Furthermore, the respondent did not indicate to the Immigration Court that he was relying on a third party as an intermediary in his immigration proceeding on any occasion. Finally, the respondent has not alleged that the hearing notices were not sent to the Flushing, New York, address as it was written on the Notice to Appear and the Form I-213.
 
*3 In the alternative, to the extent that the respondent’s motion could be construed as based upon his conversion to Christianity in the United States, and changed country conditions or personal circumstances, the Immigration Judge found that he had not satisfied his burden to merit reopening on this basis as well (I.J. at 4-5). In addition, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not established due diligence to qualify for equitable tolling in view of his 10-year delay in filing a motion to reopen between the time he learned that the immigration agency was fraudulent in 2006, and when he filed his motion to reopen in 2016 (I.J. at 6-7). Finally, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s motion did not allege ineffective assistance of counsel by the immigration agency, and that, in any event, he had not satisfied the standards for ineffective assistance (I.J. at 5).
 
On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, alleges that the hearing notices were not “properly” addressed under Matter of M-R-A-, supra, because no residential apartments were located at the Flushing address during the time period at issue inasmuch as it was a commercial property. However, he has misconstrued Matter of M-R-A-, supra, and the Immigration Judge’s reliance on that case, because the Board applied a presumption of delivery for a Notice to Appear and a Notice of Hearing which is properly addressed, i.e., the address on the envelope is identical to the address provided by the alien. The respondent also alleges that the Immigration Judge erred by holding that he knew about his statutory obligation to update immigration authorities with any address changes because he did not receive the Notice to Appear or the hearing notices. However, he presumably became familiar with the requirement for an alien to report any address changes after he married in 2010, and his wife applied for withholding of removal, which was granted.
 
The respondent also has not demonstrated due diligence on this record to obtain equitable tolling of the deadline to file a motion to reopen based on his waiting 10 years between the time when he discovered that the immigration agency was fraudulent in 2006 and filing a motion to reopen in 2016. In addition, he admitted that he essentially did nothing to resolve his illegal immigration status between 2006 and 2016. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) (to equitably toll filing deadline for motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence during entire period he seeks to toll, including both before and after ineffective assistance was or should have been discovered, and period from that point until motion is filed).
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen along with new evidence to apply for asylum based upon the alleged existence of changed country conditions for Christians in China under section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Time limits do not apply to a motion to reopen to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007); section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). The respondent must meet a heavy burden of proof to demonstrate that if the proceedings were reopened with all the attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case. Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 169 (BIA 2013); see also Matter of S-Y-G-, supra; Matter of C-W-L-, 24 I&N Dec. 346 (BIA 2007).
 
*4 Initially, we note that the respondent could have requested reopening based on changed country conditions for Christians in China when he filed his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. It is inappropriate to raise it for the time on appeal and we do not consider new evidence submitted on appeal because we review the record before the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Therefore, we construe the respondent’s motion as a motion to remand and we deny the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4) (stating that a motion to reopen which is filed while an appeal is pending before the Board may be deemed a motion to remand and may be consolidated with, and considered by the Board in connection with, the appeal to the Board).
 
The respondent has not demonstrated that a remand of the record is warranted based on his newly submitted evidence. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). He has not established changed country conditions, but rather changed personal circumstances, by virtue of his baptism in a Catholic church in the United States. Even if the respondent’s evidence established at most some worsening treatment of unregistered Catholic churches in China, this is insufficient to establish changed country conditions insofar as China has restricted religious practice since the 1990s. Chen v. Holder, 331 F.App’x 50 (2d Cir. 2009) (alien’s decision to begin practicing Falun Gong in United States did not constitute changed country conditions for reopening); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of S-Y-G-, supra, Matter of C-W-L-, supra. See also Jin v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir. 2008) (aliens who have been ordered removed may not disregard their removal orders and remain in United States long enough to change their personal circumstances by having children or practicing persecuted religion); Wang v. BIA, 437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir. 2006) (“self-induced” changes cannot suffice to show changed country conditions).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge’s decision contains a typographical error because it refers to the hearing as being conducted on April 19, 2007, as well as on April 7, 2007 (I.J. at 2).

2

Although he briefly indicated in his motion that he began attending a Roman Catholic church in the United States in 2010, and was baptized in October 2015, he did not specifically request reopening based on his religion or changed country conditions in China.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Bugge, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chelsea Braden
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 8, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on April 1, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the April 1, 2015, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Antonio Bugge, Esquire, on February 9, 2015.1 The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on April 1, 2015. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on September 22, 2015, alleging that the respondent’s friend did not inform him of his hearing, and further alleging that counsel could not reach the respondent through his friend. The respondent further alleged that he has a United States citizen child and he seeks prosecutorial discretion and cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on October 8, 2015, noting that the respondent should have contacted counsel and finding that the respondent’s evidence did not establish paternity of the child he claimed is a qualifying relative for cancellation of removal.
 
Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Receipt of notice by counsel is sufficient to deny a motion to reopen based on a lack of notice. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). The respondent also failed to demonstrate that “exceptional circumstances” prevented him from appearing at the April 1, 2015, hearing. The failure in communication between the respondent and his counsel has not been shown to be an exceptional circumstance beyond his control and sufficient to excuse his failure to appear at his scheduled hearing. See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(4)(iii)(A)(1). In view of these circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. See generally Vukmirovic v. Holder, 640 F.3d 977, 978-79 (9th Cir. 2011) (alien’s failure to know about removal hearing because he had moved without advising his lawyer or immigration court of his whereabouts did not constitute exceptional circumstances).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent alleges that he and counsel were not able to communicate with one another because the respondent speaks neither Spanish nor English, and only speaks a native Guatemalan dialect (Respondent’s Brief, page 3). However, the respondent did not raise this in his motion to reopen. We further note that the respondent has not alleged or shown ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). For ineffective assistance to serve as an exceptional circumstance, an alien must prove counsel’s deficient performance resulted in prejudice and satisfy certain procedural requirements. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 371 F.3d 771, 775-76 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam). Here, while the respondent contends that he would seek cancellation of removal, as the Immigration Judge noted, he has not established that he has a qualifying relative; nor has he provided the requisite application (Form EOIR 42B). The respondent has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for any relief, and thus he has failed to establish he suffered any prejudice, even had there been ineffective representation. See Dakane v. U.S. Attorney Gen., supra, at 1274 (“Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different”).
 
The formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied in certain circumstances where the respondent is eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing and did not receive oral warnings in his native language regarding the bar to future discretionary relief that arises from a failure to appear. See generally Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). In such cases, the motion to reopen is subject to the 90-day filing deadline set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent’s in absentia removal order was entered on April 1, 2015. The September 22, 2015, motion was thus past the 90-day deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen seeking new relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Consequently, the motion is untimely. Moreover, as noted above, the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for any relief.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert B. Jobe, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen substantially complies with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in setting out a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the totality of circumstances and evidence presented, including the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of response or opposition to the pending motion, and the evidence reflecting that former counsel(s)’ representation may have affected the outcome of the respondent’s proceedings, we will reopen the proceedings under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on the respondent’s applications for relief. See also Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1133-34 (9th Cir. 2013) (explaining the prejudice results “when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.”) (citations omitted). In so remanding, we express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order and the entry of a new decision.

APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 This matter is before us on certification from the Immigration Judge, upon issuance of his decision of January 5, 2016.

The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.

We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and was prejudiced by his former attorney, who did not present his cancellation of removal application nor his request for prosecutorial discretion (Respondent’s Brief at 11-21). The respondent requests a remand to present his application for cancellation of removal and request for prosecutorial discretion (Respondent’s Brief at 22).
 
The record shows that the respondent has supported his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with the appropriate documentation required under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). However, the respondent must also demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by the ineffective assistance. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir. 1989) (stating that to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him or her which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness).
 
The respondent has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 1). To date, the respondent has not submitted his application for cancellation of removal or sufficient supporting documentation to establish his eligibility for said relief. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (assertions of counsel are not evidence). Specifically, as the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent has not submitted evidence of his qualifying relatives nor provided proof of his continuous physical presence in the United States since 2004 (I.J. at 1). Thus, the respondent has not established that he is eligible for cancellation of removal.1
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, we do not find that the ineffective assistant of counsel described by the respondent established prejudice such that the outcome of his proceedings would have been different but for the ineffective assistance. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hiba Ghalib, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, filed a motion to reopen on August 10, 2016. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the filing. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent was charged with being subject to removal under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i), in that he failed to comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status. On November 5, 2015, the Immigration Judge granted a period of pre-conclusion voluntary departure until March 4, 2016, under section 240B(a) of the Act. It was noted that the respondent had waived the right to appeal to the Board. Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (grant of voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act requires a waiver of the right to appeal); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(D).
 
Rather than depart as ordered, the respondent on March 4, 2016, filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. This was based on the fact that on February 17, 2016, the respondent married a United States citizen, and she had filed an immediate relative visa petition on his behalf with the DHS, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In a decision mailed on March 25, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and because the respondent did not present evidence indicating a strong likelihood that his recent marriage is bona fide. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and showed no prejudice from former counsel’s actions. Finally, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as a matter of discretion. We affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying reopening on July 12, 2016.
 
The respondent’s pending motion to reopen is untimely and barred by the numerical limitations on motions. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2)(subject to certain exceptions, an alien in removal proceedings may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, whether before the Board or Immigration Judge).
 
The pending time and number-barred motion to reopen also does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). The August 10, 2016, motion speculates that approval of the immediate relative visa petition filed by the respondent’s wife is imminent. A check of the USCIS case status system using the receipt number provided by the respondent with his motion shows that, instead, the visa petition is still pending before USCIS. In any event, even if approved, becoming potentially eligible for adjustment of status is not uncommon and generally not a basis for granting an untimely motion to reopen. See generally Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
*2 The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The number-barred motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Polina Tomashevsky, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43)(F))
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 19, 2015, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider.1 The record does not contain a response from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge improperly weighed the evidence in the record and, as such, erred in finding him ineligible for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (I.J.2 at 3-4, 6-8; Respondent’s Brief at 4-9). See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (stating that a motion to reconsider must include an allegation of material factual or legal error in the prior decision).2 Namely, the respondent argues that he was not convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude that bars his eligibility for this relief (Respondent’s Brief at 4-9). See section 245(a) of the Act (stating that, to be eligible for adjustment of status, an alien must be admissible to the United States for permanent residence); section 212(a)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A) of the Act (stating that an alien who has been convicted an offense that constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible).
 
The respondent pled guilty to theft on April 15, 2002, and was sentenced to probation before judgment (“PBJ”) (I.J.1 at 3-4). He does not contest the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that this offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude (I.J.2 at 6-7). However, he contends that, on November 14, 2006, his PBJ disposition was entered nolle prosequi based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings (I.J.1 at 2). As such, he argues that his judgment does not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes (I.J.1 at 2). See section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A) (defining a “conviction” under the Act); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621, 624 (BIA 2003) (stating that when a court vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the alien no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of the Act).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge properly weighed the evidence in the record in determining that the respondent was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (I.J.2 at 6-8). From the outset, we agree that the respondent bears the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for this relief (I.J.2 at 6; Respondent’s Brief at 4-6). See Salem v. Holder, 647 F.3d 111, 115 (4th Cir. 2011) (stating that the alien bears the burden of demonstrating that a mandatory bar to eligibility for relief does not apply).
 
To meet his burden, the respondent submitted a letter from a Maryland criminal attorney, stating that a PBJ disposition is only entered nolle prosequi when a case is subject to a post-conviction action that corrects a constitutional violation (I.J.2 at 6-7). The respondent also submitted a letter from his former attorney, stating that this attorney “argued and got [the respondent’s] theft conviction quashed” pursuant to a coram nobis petition (I.J.2 at 7). Finally, the respondent submitted excerpts from the Maryland Court Rules and Legislative Handbook, which provide a description of avenues for post-conviction relief (I.J.2 at 7).
 
The evidence submitted is not sufficient to meet the respondent’s burden (I.J.2 at 7). The respondent has provided no evidence or testimony establishing the grounds on which his specific PBJ disposition was entered nolle prosequi (I.J.2 at 6-7). The letter from the criminal attorney is based on the attorney’s personal experience and does not discuss the respondent’s matter (I.J.2 at 6-7). Similarly, the letter from the respondent’s former attorney does not describe the details of the case or the grounds on which he quashed the respondent’s conviction (I.J.2 at 7).3 Accordingly, these letters in combination with the excerpts from the Maryland Court Rules and Legislative Handbook do not establish that the respondent’s PBJ disposition was entered nolle prosequi based on a defect in his underlying criminal proceedings (I.J. at 7). See Matter of Pickering, supra, at 624.
 
The respondent thus has not established that the Immigration Judge erred in weighing the evidence in the record and concluding that he was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude that barred his eligibility for adjustment of status (I.J.2 at 6-8). See Matter of O-S-G-, supra. Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider and ordering him removed from the United States (I.J.2 at 9).
 
The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a continuance to allow United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) to reconsider its revocation of his Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) (Respondent’s Brief at 9-10). Nevertheless, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s denial. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983) (stating that an alien must establish that the denial of a continuance caused actual prejudice and materially affected the outcome of the case). As discussed above, the respondent has not demonstrated that he is eligible for adjustment of status, as he was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude that rendered him inadmissible. Therefore, the USCIS’s forthcoming decision regarding the respondent’s Form I-130 will not impact the outcome of his case. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s denial of voluntary departure (I.J.2 at 8-9). We thus deem this issue to be waived on appeal. See Matter of G-G-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 339, 340 n.2 (BIA 2014).

“I.J.1” refers to the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent was convicted of a theft offense for immigration purposes, dated March 19, 2015. “I.J.2” refers to the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider, dated August 19, 2015.

We also note that the respondent’s former attorney provided this letter in response to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel complaint against him, based on which the Board reopened the instant matter on October 31, 2012.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated December 5, 2014, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia removal order that was entered on June 2, 2014. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We are unable to meaningfully review the December 5, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge as that order consists of a two-sentence conclusion of law without any findings of fact or analysis (Resp. Br. at 7-8). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(iv); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 463-65 (BIA 2002) (Immigration Judges must include in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and comply with controlling law). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not met his burden to establish ineffective assistance of his former counsel in order to toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly, J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
However, the Immigration Judge did not render any findings regarding what requirements of Matter Lozada, supra, for an ineffective assistance claim, have or have not been met.1 In this regard, there is evidence of record that the respondent submitted an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his former counsel, that the respondent has informed his former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance through a complaint with a state bar, and the respondent has submitted a formal complaint against his former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authority (Resp. Br. at 12; DHS Br. at 2-4).2 Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Moreover, the Immigration Judge should determine whether the respondent has met his burden to establish that his former counsel’s ineffective assistance resulted in actual prejudice (Resp. Br. at 12-13). Id. at 640. Additionally, if the Immigration Judge finds that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim has been established, he should then determine if equitable tolling applies. Therefore, the record must be remanded for the preparation of a decision by the Immigration Judge that will permit meaningful appellate review. By remanding the record, the Board does not express any opinion on the final outcome of this matter.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ray A. Ybarra Maldonado, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to administratively close proceedings
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the April 24, 2015, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to administratively close proceedings.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s discretionary decision to deny the respondent’s request for administrative closure. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012) (outlining factors for evaluating whether administrative closure is warranted, including the likelihood of success on any underlying requests for relief).2 We observe that administrative closure is used to temporarily remove a case from an Immigration Judge’s active calendar or from the Board’s docket. See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 480 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 692. The administrative closure of a case does not result in a final order. It is merely an administrative convenience that allows cases to be removed from the calendar in appropriate situations, subject to being recalendared at a later date. See Matter of Amico, 19 I&N Dec. 652, 654 n.1 (BIA 1988).
 
In the present case, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to administratively close proceedings because she had no apparent relief available to her other than voluntary departure. The DHS opposed administrative closure in this case, and the DHS Office of the Chief Counsel had declined to exercise prosecutorial discretion (I.J. at 6; Tr. at 46). While the respondent argues that she is eligible for prosecutorial discretion, the DHS has sole authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this matter (Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). Neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982).
 
The respondent also contends that her case should be administratively closed in light of pending litigation in Puente Arizona v. Arpaio, 76 F.Supp.3d 833 (D. Ariz. 2015), or in the alternative, be held in abeyance. On January 5, 2015, the District Court for Arizona found that Arizona’s identity theft laws were facially preempted by federal immigration policy and granted the plaintiffs--an immigrant advocacy organization, individual “unauthorized aliens,” and taxpayers of Maricopa County--a preliminary injunction preventing the Arizona government defendants from enforcing the challenged provisions. Id. at 869. The respondent argues that a favorable decision in this case could result in the vacation of her conviction, where she was convicted of criminal impersonation in Arizona (Respondent’s Br. at 7; Exhs. 4-5). After the respondent submitted her brief on August 26, 2015, however, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s holding that the laws are likely facially preempted and vacated the preliminary injunction. Puente Arizona v. Arpaio, 821 F.3d 1098 (9th Cir. 2016). As such, the respondent’s argument on this issue is moot.
 
*2 Finally, to the extent the respondent asserts that her due process rights were violated in the proceedings below, we are unpersuaded. See Cruz Rendon v. Holder, 603 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that in order to prevail on a due process claim that she was denied a full and fair removal hearing, an alien must demonstrate that the challenged proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case; and that she suffered prejudice, such that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation). The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge acted in a prosecutorial manner rather than remaining neutral, and that she was questioned by the Immigration Judge, without the presence of counsel, despite appearing in court under the belief that she would be represented (Respondent’s Br. at 4-5, 11).
 
We do not find a basis to conclude that the Immigration Judge’s management of the record establishes a due process violation. We have reviewed the record and find no basis to conclude that the Immigration Judge’s questioning or comments in any way exceeded judicial bounds. An Immigration Judge has the authority to “““interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien” in removal proceedings. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1); see generally Matter of Rhee, 16 I&N Dec. 607 (BIA 1978).
 
Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent made statements without the presence of counsel, such as admitting to her convictions, the record supports those statements, and the respondent has not argued otherwise (Tr. at 19-21 (Mar. 8, 2013); Exhs. 4-5). Insofar as the respondent claims that the counsel she hired did not properly represent her, the record does not reflect that she was in fact represented at the time of her final hearing; instead, it reflects that the court granted a motion to withdraw from her former counsel, but no Notice of Appearance on her behalf was filed subsequently by another representative until her appeal to the Board (Exhs. 8-9). The respondent has also not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or demonstrated that she suffered resultant prejudice.3 Overall, we conclude that remanded proceedings are not warranted on this basis.
 
Based on the foregoing, the discretionary benefit of administrative closure was not appropriate in this case, and the motion to administrative close was properly denied. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, supra, at 505 (once the DHS institutes proceedings, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge); Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 696. The respondent provided evidence that she paid the required voluntary departure bond; therefore, we will reinstate the period of voluntary departure. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if she provides to the DHS such evidence of her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

At the final hearing on April 24, 2015, the Immigration Judge orally denied the respondent’s motion for administrative closure. In an oral decision and form order issued the same day, the Immigration Judge also granted post-conclusion voluntary departure to the respondent.

2

In Matter of Avetisyan, the Board held that, in determining whether administrative closure of proceedings is appropriate, an Immigration Judge or the Board should weigh all the relevant factors presented in the case. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the reason administrative closure is sought; (2) the basis for any opposition to administrative closure; (3) the likelihood the respondent will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he or she is pursuing outside of removal proceedings; (4) the anticipated duration of the closure; (5) the responsibility of either party, if any, in contributing to any current or anticipated delay; and (6) the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings (for example, termination of the proceedings or entry of a removal order) when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board. Id. at 695.

3

Specifically, the respondent has not presented an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her prior counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations the prior counsel did or did not make, the respondent does not indicate that her prior counsel was informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and has been given an opportunity to respond, and the respondent does not indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Additionally, because the respondent has not shown that, but for her prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, she would have obtained post-conviction relief, she has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s ineffective assistance.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth S. Levine, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 5, 2015, denying her motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for her failure to appear at the hearing on June 18, 2009. We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that she failed to appear at her removal hearing due to exceptional circumstances, specifically, the ineffective assistance of her former attorney, and because she lacked notice. In denying her motion, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent received sufficient notice and that she failed to use due diligence in filing her motion to reopen. However, the Immigration Judge did not address the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or her request for sua sponte reopening. Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of this claim and the entry of a new decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting the Board’s fact-finding ability on appeal).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul Clemente Supple, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on July 5, 2007, after not appearing at her hearing. She filed a motion to reopen on August 6, 2015, and the respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 29, 2015, denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing because it was mailed to her former address (Resp. Brief at 11). She further argues that her former attorney committed ineffective assistance of counsel by not raising the issue of lack of notice in her motion to reopen (Resp. Brief at 11-12). However, the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008) (setting forth the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, the respondent has not submitted a sworn statement attesting to lack of notice, or explaining why she did not notify the Immigration Court of her change of address from that listed on the Notice to Appear. We further note that the Notice of Hearing for July 5, 2007, was not returned as undeliverable. The statements of counsel in her appellate brief are not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Consequently, we decline to reopen or remand these proceedings based on the lack of notice.
 
In addition, the respondent argues on appeal that she established an exceptional situation to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). She states that she was not notified of her hearing and is eligible for benefits under the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. The respondent further states that she is the parent of three United States citizen children who were born subsequent to the hearing and one of whom is being treated for cancer. The respondent argues that these proceedings should be reopened based on humanitarian considerations.
 
*2 We are sympathetic to the respondent and especially to her child who is battling a serious disease. However, the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear on March 2, 2006, waited more than 9 years to file her motion to reopen, and she did not provide an explanation for her lack of due diligence. In addition, the Immigration Judge has no jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s eligibility for DAPA; the application for such a discretionary status or any similar exercise of prosecutorial discretion should be directed to the Department of Homeland Security. In light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening of these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James Bradley Rudolph, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amelia C. Anderson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 29, 2014, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand and request for stay of removal. The record will be remanded.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In considering this appeal, we note our decision in Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994). Therein, we indicated that when a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is denied, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision; otherwise, the parties are deprived of a fair opportunity to contest the Immigration Judge’s determination on appeal, and the Board is unable to meaningfully exercise its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal. See also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen on a form order, checking the box that states: “[t]he court agrees with the reasons stated in the opposition to the motion,” adding the handwritten notation “independently and cumulatively.” The Immigration Judge also checked the box that states: “[t]he motion is untimely per,” adding the handwritten notation “8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(1) and tolling is not appropriate for the reasons stated in the DHS opposition.” The Immigration Judge failed to specifically address the issues raised in the respondent’s motion, including the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding prior counsel’s conduct, and his claim that he was prejudiced by such conduct. We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision provides an insufficient basis upon which the Board can adequately conduct a meaningful review.
 
Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the record for inclusion of an appropriate decision by the Immigration Judge. The respondent and the Department of Homeland Security should be served with a copy of the decision and should thereafter be given an opportunity to submit briefs in accordance with the regulations. The record should then be forwarded to the Board for further consideration.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie Law
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 18, 2002, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) and 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), (h), and ordering him removed. On May 26, 2016, more than 13½ years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the motion, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance by attorney John Perez, who represented him before the Immigration Judge, and attorney Yalia Guerrero, who represented him on appeal. The respondent argues that the former counsels provided ineffective assistance because they did not argue that the respondent’s 2001 conviction was not an aggravated felony or a removable offense and they did not advise the respondent to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), or to terminate the proceedings
 
However, the respondent’s motion was filed more than 13/4 years after the Board’s final administrative decision, and the respondent has not addressed the untimeliness of his motion. In Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, __ F.3d __, 2016 WL 4056051 (5th Cir. July 28, 2016), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of limitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing. Whether equitable tolling is appropriate in a case depends on individual facts and circumstances of the case. Although the respondent argues that his former counsels provided ineffective assistance by failing to make certain arguments, the respondent has not explained how he has acted with due diligence in pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claims during the period of more than 13½ years since the Board’s prior decision.
 
*2 Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the respondent has shown that his former counsels provided ineffective assistance at the time of his hearing and appeal. The respondent’s arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel are based on recent development in caselaw regarding the definition of “““crime of violence” aggravated felony and divisibility of criminal statutes. Descamps v. U.S., 133 S.Ct. 2276 (2013); United States v. Gonzalez-Longoria, 813 F.3d 225 (5th Cir. 2016), on reh’g en banc, No. 15-40041, 2016 WL 4169127 (5th Cir. Aug. 5, 2016); Gomez-Perez v. Lynch, __ F.3d __, No. 14-60808, 2016 WL 3709757 (5th Cir. July 11, 2016); see also Dimaya v. Lynch, 803 F.3d 1110 (9th Cir. 2015), petition for cert. pending (No. 15-1498, Jun. 10, 2016); United States v. Vivas-Ceja, 808 F.3d 719, 720 (7th Cir. 2015). These cases had not yet been published in 2002 but were only published many years after the respondent’s proceedings were concluded. The respondent has not shown how a reasonably competent attorney should have been expected to present arguments based on these cases in 2002, or how his former counsels’ representation rose to the level of ineffective assistance for not making these arguments in 2002. The respondent argues that attorney Perez was not even clear whether the respondent was seeking a waiver under section 212(c) or 212(h) of the Act. However, the Immigration Judge considered both waivers under the legal standard applicable at the time (I.J. at 2).
 
Based on the above, the respondent has not shown that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance by his former counsels. The respondent also has not shown that his case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied as untimely. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Seth L. Reszko, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision granting him post-conclusion voluntary departure. This proceeding was previously before the Board when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal as to the merits of his adjustment of status application, but remanded the record for reconsideration of his application for voluntary departure at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The appeal is dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the Immigration Judge’s credibility determination, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). The respondent has the burden of proving his eligibility for the relief sought. Sections 208(b)(1)(B), 241(b)(3)(C) of the Act; Matter of J-B-N & S-M-, 24 I& N. Dec. 208 (BIA 2007).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent contends that, on remand, the Immigration Judge erred in declining to consider his request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act. However, the respondent waived this issue. The respondent was represented by counsel during his hearing on the merits, and his attorney only requested voluntary departure as an alternative form of relief at the end of the hearing (Tr. dated 10/6/14 at 6). Further, in his first appeal, the respondent did not argue that he was eligible for pre-conclusion voluntary departure. As such, the respondent has waived this issue. Matter of L-G-H-, 26 I&N Dec. 365, 366 n.1 (BIA 2014); Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.8 (BIA 2012).1
 
Moreover, the respondent did not demonstrate that he was eligible for pre-conclusion voluntary departure. He did not request such relief at his initial merits hearing; he made additional requests for relief, and did not withdraw such requests prior to the Immigration Judge’s original denial of relief; and he did not waive appeal of all issues (Tr. dated 6/2/14 and 10/6/14 at 1-20). Section 240B(b) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (D). Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s grant of post conclusion voluntary departure.
 
*2 The respondent also contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying a continuance because he was not eligible for adjustment of status due to a false claim to United States citizenship. We previously addressed these issues (BIA Dec. dated 1/19/16 at 2-3), and we will not revisit them.
 
The respondent’s brief erroneously requests in its conclusion certain relief that the respondent did not seek (Respondent’s Brief at 7). As such, there is no need to address this request for relief. Since the Immigration Judge granted the respondent post-conclusion voluntary departure, and the respondent attached evidence that he paid the requisite bond, we will reinstate voluntary departure on appeal. Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

His attorney does not allege that he provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, under the circumstances of this case, we find no merit to the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge had an independent obligation to pursue pre-conclusion voluntary departure on the respondent’s behalf.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sylvia L. Esparza, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 On June 8, 2015, the Board upheld an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The respondent had sought reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
This matter is now before the Board pursuant to a July 27, 2016, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted a motion to remand filed by the Government. The Government sought a remand “[b]ecause it appears that the Board may have used a more stringent standard than required by Ninth Circuit law when adjudicating [the respondent’s] motion to reopen[.]” The Government also noted that the Board may not make an adverse credibility finding on a motion to reopen but must accept evidence, and an alien’s statements, as true unless inherently unbelievable.
 
The respondent is ultimately seeking reopening, in part, to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group. Since the Immigration Judge’s original decision in this matter, the Ninth Circuit has issued intervening precedent regarding particular social group based asylum and withholding of removal claims. See Pirir-Boc v. Holder, 750 F.3d 1077 (9th Cir. 2014). The resolution of the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim will require consideration of such intervening precedent. Additionally, further fact finding may be required.
 
Given the totality of the circumstances, we deem it appropriate to remand this matter to the Immigration Judge to readjudicate the respondent’s motion to reopen, in a manner that is consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s order granting the Government’s motion to remand, as well as current Ninth Circuit precedent on particular social group claims. Upon remand, both parties shall not be precluded from proffering additional evidence, both testimonial and documentary.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Felipe D.J. Millan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rachel McDonald
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on March 28, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and reinstated the 60-day period of voluntary departure granted by the Immigration Judge. On July 20, 2016, almost 4 months after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent argues that an alien “may be entitled to reopen the case out of time” if the alien is deprived of his due process rights due to ineffective assistance of counsel and suffers prejudice (Motion, at 5-6). However, the respondent cites no caselaw from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in support of this proposition. The respondent offers no explanation on whether or why he could not file a timely motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. To the extent we construe the respondent’s argument as urging us to apply equitable tolling of the motion to reopen time limitations, the respondent has not explained the legal or factual basis of any equitable tolling in his case. The respondent also argues that time and number limitations shall not apply to a motion to reopen agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed (Motion, at 6). However, the DHS has not joined in the current motion but has opposed the motion as noted above. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is untimely, and will be denied as untimely.
 
Even if the respondent’s motion were timely filed, the respondent has not shown that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance by attorney Enrique Garcia, his former counsel. The respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance because he: (1) did not pursue his derivative citizenship claim through his father, who naturalized in 2001; (2) did not contest the false claim of citizenship charge; (3) did not pursue his adjustment of status claim based on the visa petition filed by his United States citizen spouse; (4) did not pursue benefits under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”); and (5) did not move to terminate the proceedings. We will address these claims in turn.
 
First, as to the derivative citizenship claim, contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the former counsel did make the derivative citizenship claim and submitted documents in support of this claim, as noted in the Board’s prior decision. The former counsel also stated that the respondent had previously submitted an Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shortly after his father’s naturalization, and that he was again in the process of re-applying for the certificate and to determine what happened to the initial request (Resp. App. Brief, “Argument”). Therefore, the record does not support the respondent’s assertion that the former counsel failed to file an Application for Certificate of Citizenship or pursue the derivative citizenship claim (Motion, at 9). In any event, as noted in the Board’s prior decision (fn. 3), the respondent may file a motion to reopen and to terminate, if and when he is issued a Certificate of Citizenship by the USCIS. Therefore, the respondent did not show that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s failure to pursue the derivative citizenship claim.
 
*2 Next, as to the false claim of United States citizenship issue, the respondent does not deny that in May 2005 he made a false claim of United States citizenship before immigration officers.1 However, the respondent argues that the former counsel should have argued that the respondent’s false claim falls within the exception set forth in section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act because the respondent’s father was naturalized in 2001 (Motion, at 10-11). Nevertheless, the respondent has not shown that, if the former counsel had argued that the respondent falls within this exception, such argument may have been upheld. Section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(II) of the Act requires, inter alia, that “each natural parent of the alien (emphasis added)” be a United States citizen, either by birth or naturalization. Although the record shows that the respondent’s father was a naturalized United States citizen when the respondent made the claim of citizenship, the record does not show, and the respondent has not argued, that his mother was also a United States citizen at that time. Therefore, the respondent has not shown that he falls within this exception, or that his argument would have been successful if he had made an argument that he falls within this exception. In addition, since the respondent is inadmissible based on the false claim of United States citizen citizenship, his application for adjustment of status would have been denied even if he had applied for this form of relief.
 
As to the respondent’s argument that the former counsel failed to apply for DACA, even assuming that the respondent can establish his eligibility for DACA, this is a matter within the authority of the USCIS, not the Board or the Immigration Judge. Furthermore, the respondent is not prevented from seeking DACA by the fact that he is under an order of removal.
 
The respondent next argues that the former counsel should have moved for termination of these proceedings, but we are not persuaded that a motion to terminate may have been granted based on the record of this case. As noted in the Board’s prior decision and again in this decision, if and when the respondent is issued a Certificate of Citizenship by the USCIS, he may file a motion to reopen and terminate. Based on the above, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of his former counsel. See Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595 (5th Cir. 1993).
 
The respondent also urges in his motion for stay of removal that he should be granted a stay of removal so that he can have the opportunity to file an application for cancellation of removal (Motion for Stay, at 5). The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely as noted above, and this aspect of the motion does not fall within any exception to the motion to reopen time limitations enumerated in section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). Furthermore, the respondent has not shown prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal, nor did he submit an application and supporting documents for this form of relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c)(1) (requiring that a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of applying for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation).
 
*3 Finally, we do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The DHS argues that the respondent was never charged for false claim of United States citizenship thus he could not have contested the charge (DHS Opp. at 5). However, the former counsel conceded that the respondent was inadmissible based on the false claim of United States citizen citizenship and he is not eligible for adjustment of status, therefore he will not seek adjustment of status (Tr. at 11). Section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). We therefore construe the respondent’s argument as an argument that the former counsel should have argued that the respondent is not inadmissible based on the false claim of citizenship.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Davar Yusufi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of August 4, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s July 9, 2015, motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on August 12, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen alleges that her failure to appear for her August 12, 2005, hearing was due to exceptional circumstances.1 The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by a non-attorney who held himself out to be an attorney. Specifically, the respondent asserts that she hired Paul Falcon and they were to meet across the street from the Immigration Court on August 12, 2005, but he did not show up, and when she called him, he advised her not to go to her hearing or she would be arrested and deported. A claim of “ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an ‘exceptional circumstance’ warranting the reopening of a deportation order entered in absentia.” Arts v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 596 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).
 
A motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion claiming that she did not appear at her hearing because of ineffective assistance by Mr. Falcon, was untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has recognized that equitable tolling may apply in some circumstances. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). The respondent is required to demonstrate “due diligence” in pursuing her claim during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (requiring an alien to demonstrate due diligence independent from the requirement of demonstrating ineffective assistance of former counsel).
 
*2 The respondent here has not demonstrated or even argued that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her claim (I.J. at 2-3). The respondent stated in her affidavit supporting her motion to reopen that after failing to appear at her hearing, she went to the Fasano, Madeo law firm and informed them she had an in absentia order of deportation but they asked for too much money. The respondent has not indicated that she took any other measures to secure new counsel or otherwise pursue her claim herself. Instead, the respondent waited to seek reopening until approximately 10 years after entry of her removal order. Consequently, equitable tolling is not appropriate here. See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006); Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that petitioner failed to exercise due diligence when, after he should have known of his initial counsel’s ineffectiveness, he waited fourteen months to pursue the claim).
 
When an alien brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel stemming from the actions of a non-attorney immigration consultant, he must still make an effort to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See, e.g., Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that the Board’s decision to deny the alien’s ineffective assistance claim against a non-attorney immigration consultant based on non-compliance with Lozada was “““neither arbitrary nor capricious”). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with the Lozada requirements insofar has she has not indicated that she informed Mr. Falcon of the allegations against him and she has further not indicated that she filed a complaint with the relevant state disciplinary authorities. The respondent has thus not even substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent has proffered evidence on appeal. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Maim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, the respondent has not shown that this evidence is new or previously unavailable, or that it could possibly alter the decision in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (holding that a party who seeks a remand to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Therefore, we find that a remand is not warranted.
 
*3 Lastly, we find that the approval of the respondent’s visa petition does not warrant reopening and remand under Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). That ease provides that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where he was not given oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. Neither condition is satisfied here.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e) (5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Although the record does not contain the notice of hearing for the August 12, 2005, hearing, we find no prejudice therefrom. The respondent does not allege lack of notice, and in fact asserts that she was aware of her August 12, 2005, hearing and appeared outside the Immigration Court on that date. See Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (even if inadequacies in alien’s removal proceeding amounted to fundamental procedural errors, errors did not prejudice alien); United States v. Fernandez-Antonia, 278 F.3d 150, 159-60 (2d Cir. 2002) (an alien must show prejudice, which in turn requires a showing that but for the alleged constitutional violation, the result in his case might have been different).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Caridad Pastor Cardinale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rosario Shoudy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 7, 2015, decision denying his second motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him on March 1, 2007, after he failed to appear for his scheduled hearing. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on March 1, 2007, when he failed to appear for his scheduled hearing. The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen and rescind the order on September 12, 2014, asking the Immigration Judge to exercise her sua sponte authority. On November 13, 2014, that motion was denied. The respondent then filed a motion to reconsider which was denied by the Immigration Judge on December 31, 2014. The respondent then filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, his second, on October 13, 2015.
 
Through the instant motion, the respondent claimed that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel because his prior attorney did not submit all of the documentation necessary with his first motion to reopen and failed to appeal the denial of his motion to reconsider (I.J. at 6). See Respondent’s Brief at 5-7. The respondent also, for the first time, claimed that he did not receive proper notice of his March 1, 2007, hearing. See id. at 4-5. According to the respondent, because the Notice of Hearing was returned to the Immigration Court as “undeliverable as addressed, no forwarding order on file,” the Immigration Court must have improperly addressed the notice and, thus, his non-receipt was “through no fault of his own.” See id. at 5.
 
Notwithstanding the respondent’s contentions on appeal, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his second motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order entered against him on March 1, 2007 (I.J. at 5-6). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2016) (de novo review). The respondent is not entitled to rescission of a removal order where the failure to receive actual notice of the time of the hearing is the result of his failure to comply with the obligation to keep the Immigration Court apprised of his current mailing address. The alien who evades notice cannot reopen the removal hearing. See Thompson v. Lynch, 788 F.3d 638 (6th Cir. 2015) (alien’s obligation under Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure that the government had an address at which he could be reached throughout the removal proceedings included the duty to correct the incorrect address listed on his notice to appear).
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge that service of the Notice of Hearing was properly mailed to the last address provided by the respondent. Furthermore, as is the case here, if an alien does not fulfill his obligation to report his address change, notice of the hearing is not required pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Service by mail is sufficient if the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F). Section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c).
 
The respondent does not dispute that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to his address of record at the time it was issued, and the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the address provided by the respondent as reflected in the Form I-213 (Exh. 3). Therefore, the respondent can be charged with receiving proper notice, whether or not he actually received the Notice of Hearing. Sanchez v. Holder, 627 F.3d 226 (6th Cir. 2010) (initiating deportation proceedings in absentia does not depend on whether the alien actually receives notice of a deportation hearing, but rather on whether the government properly mails the notice according to the statute).
 
Regarding the respondent’s contention that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to his first motion to reopen and the appeal of his motion to reconsider, these allegations had no bearing on the respondent’s encounters with immigration officers when he was served with the Notice to Appear and was released on his own recognizance. On both of those occasions, the respondent was advised of his address obligations. Consequently, the Notice of Hearing was properly mailed to the respondent at the address he provided, and the respondent has not established that non-delivery was not due to his own fault (I.J. at 5-6). Therefore, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] (lodged) - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2015, decision ordering him removed. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion will be denied.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges that he did not have adequate time to prepare for his hearing because on February 9, 2015, he received the court’s February 4, 2015, notice of hearing, informing him that his master calendar hearing was rescheduled to February 26, 2015, approximately 1 year sooner than his previously scheduled February 24, 2016, hearing. Specifically, the respondent alleges that he was prejudiced by the change in hearing date because he did not have adequate time to marry his fiancée or to obtain post-conviction relief. Nonetheless, the respondent did not make these arguments or request a continuance before the Immigration Judge, and we will not consider these arguments now (Tr. at 9-17). See Matter of Jimenez, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996) (providing that the Board will not consider arguments made for the first time on appeal).
 
In his motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent asserts that his former counsel erred in his representation when he sent a colleague to appear at the respondent’s master calendar hearing on February 26, 2015, without the respondent’s prior knowledge or consent (Resp. Br. at 2). He further asserts that his colleague was unfamiliar with immigration proceedings, was unaware of the type of relief for which the respondent was eligible, and because of these factors, the Immigration Judge ordered him removed (Resp. Br. at 3).
 
*2 In presenting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must comply with certain procedural requirements. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that in order to prevail on a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish and include the following: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not); Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board).
 
Here, we find that the respondent has not substantially met these procedural requirements. Although the respondent has submitted a copy of a complaint form detailing the allegations against his former counsel, he has not submitted an affidavit describing the facts and his agreement with his former counsel, nor has he provided any evidence that his former counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before he filed his brief to the Board. See id; see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984) (statements by counsel in a brief are not evidence); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). The respondent has also not explained how he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638 (describing that in order to prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must also show that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions). Thus, we decline to remand proceedings on this basis. Accordingly, the following orders wilt be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

The respondent titles his brief “Respondent’s Brief in Support of Appeal” (Resp. Br. at 1). However, the respondent’s brief does not allege that the Immigration Judge erred in her decision, and only requests remand on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. As the respondent has presented previously unavailable evidence and requests a remand, we will construe the arguments presented in this brief as a motion to remand. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), 1003.2(c)(4); see Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516 (BIA 2015).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was previously before this Board on November 17, 2015, when the record of proceedings was remanded for adjudication of the respondent’s request for equitable tolling of the deadline for filing a motion to reopen. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 13, 2016, denying his motion to reopen. On appeal, the respondent contends that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his motion to reopen and that the Immigration Judge was impermissibly biased. The Department of Homeland Security did not file a brief on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision that equitable tolling is not merited in this case to toll the deadline for filing the respondent’s motion to reopen. A “litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, -- F.3d --, 2016 WL 4056051, at *5 (5th Cir. July 28, 2016). Even if the respondent had appealed his initial removal order and had not prevailed, he has not demonstrated his diligence and an extraordinary circumstance following the issuance of Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257 (5th Cir. 2012), which is the basis for his motion to reopen.
 
The Immigration Judge found without clear error that the respondent’s current counsel filed a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) on behalf of the respondent on October 22, 2012, which was after the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued Garcia-Carias, supra, on September 27, 2012. The respondent does not contend that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has not submitted evidence to establish the nature of his attorney’s representation before the Immigration Court beginning in 2012, or otherwise demonstrated that he acted with “reasonable diligence” and that an “““‘extraordinary circumstance’ ‘beyond his control’ prevented him from complying with the applicable deadline.” See Lugo-Resendez, supra; see also Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998) (noting that “statements in a brief, motion, or Notice of Appeal are not evidence and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight”). Upon review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate that equitable tolling applies, as he has not shown due diligence in pursuing his claim.
 
*2 Moreover, we find no merit in the respondent’s contentions that the Immigration Judge was biased or acted other than impartially in conducting these removal proceedings. See Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554-56 (1994) (holding that “opinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible”); see also Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303, 306 (BIA 1982) (holding that an alien generally must show “personal, rather than judicial bias stemming from an ‘extrajudicial source’ which resulted in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the immigration judge learned from his participation in the case”).
 
The nature of the respondent’s second removal order was potentially relevant to the issue of whether he exercised due diligence in 2012 and, as the movant, it was the respondent’s burden to provide evidence in support of his motion. See section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). There is also no indication that the Immigration Judge’s criticism of the respondent’s counsel had any effect on the outcome of the case. Ultimately, the Immigration Judge’s conduct of these proceedings was fundamentally fair and does not reflect “bullying or hostile” treatment of the respondent’s counsel or the respondent.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Melinda M. Basaran, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s November 24, 2015, decision which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The respondent was personally served on June 18, 2001, with the Notice to Appear, which bears his signature (Exh. 1). It informed him of his responsibility to report any change of address to immigration authorities, and the consequences for failure to appear were explained to him in Spanish. On July 16, 2001, a hearing notice for a hearing scheduled on October 5, 2001, was mailed to the respondent’s attorney and it was not returned by the Postal Service.
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on October 5, 2001, at which the respondent failed to appear and the Department of Homeland Security presented evidence, the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b. A copy of the in absentia removal order was mailed to the respondent’s attorney, and it was not returned by the Postal Service.
 
On October 19, 2015, which was 14 years after he had been ordered removed, the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to rescind his in absentia removal order because he claimed that his attorney had not informed him about the October 5, 2001, hearing. He alleged that he had been beaten by gang members in El Salvador after he refused their recruitment efforts, he requested reopening based on changed country conditions in the form of increased violence related to gangs and drug cartels, and he indicated that he fears criminal gang violence in El Salvador.
 
*2 We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s November 24, 2015, decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). The respondent has not established that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of a lack of notice because his attorney received proper notice of the hearing (I.J. at 2). Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to alien’s counsel constitutes notice to alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). He conceded that he did not have a “stable address” after he entered the United States, and that he “traveled from place to place.” However, he does not allege that he submitted change of address forms as required, and the record does not contain any change of address forms. To the extent that he claims that his attorney did not advise him about his hearing, he has not indicated that he informed her of his new address after he moved which would enable her to notify him about his hearing. If an alien does not fulfill his obligation to report his address change, notice of the hearing is not required pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). See also Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 360-61 (5th Cir. 2009).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged or established that his prior attorney committed ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based upon her unsuccessful communications with attorney about hearing date did not establish exceptional circumstances where she failed to satisfy all of requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
In addition, the respondent has not alleged that he did not receive personal service of the Notice to Appear or that the consequences for failure to appear were not explained to him in Spanish. He has not indicated what actions, if any, he initiated to determine his immigration status after signing the Notice to Appear in 2001.
 
Finally, the respondent requested reopening to apply for asylum based upon the alleged existence of changed country conditions under section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Time limits do not apply to a motion to reopen to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007); section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). The respondent must meet a heavy burden of proof to demonstrate that if the proceedings were reopened with all the attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case. Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 169 (BIA 2013); see also Matter of S-Y-G-, supra; Matter of C-W-L-, 24 I&N Dec. 346 (BIA 2007).
 
*3 The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not established changed country conditions to qualify for reopening (I.J. at 2). We agree that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely, that the evidence submitted by the respondent in support of the motion did not establish that he qualified for any of the exceptions on the time restrictions, and that, even if his evidence established at most some worsening of conditions, it does not establish a material change in country conditions sufficient to meet the heavy burden to merit reopening inasmuch as gang violence and drug cartels have been prevalent in El Salvador for many years, Panjwani v. Gonzales, 401 F.3d 626, 633 (5th Cir. 2005) (violence between Muslims and Hindus was not uncommon in India at time of original hearing and evidence submitted with motion only indicated continuation of such violence); Matter of S-Y-G-, supra. To the extent that the respondent fears violence in El Salvador, these conditions affect the entire population of the country, and, without more, do not qualify an alien for asylum or withholding of removal in the United States. See, e.g., Matter of Sosa Ventura, 25 I&N Dec. 391, 394 (BIA 2010) (aliens fleeing general violence are not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal).
 
Moreover, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not merit sua sponte reopening under Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (I.J. at 3). We agree that he has not established that his case meets the standard of “““exceptional situations” for sua sponte reopening. Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alison Berry, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2015, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s November 13, 2014, decision, in which she denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider because the motion did not specify any error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). In her motion to reconsider, the respondent asserted that the Immigration Judge had overlooked a question of fact in her motion to reopen, specifically that she had alleged that she had received ineffective assistance of counsel from her previous representative. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider because she concluded that she had not overlooked an ineffective assistance claim in the respondent’s motion to reopen but rather that the respondent had not made such a claim in her motion to reopen.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had not set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in her motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen states that she had “reconsidered her decision to agree to an Order of Voluntary Departure,1 believes that her previous decision was ill-advised” and that she was “not previously aware of the legal ramifications of being grandfathered under her step-father’s petition.” In her affidavit in support of her motion to reopen, the respondent stated that it was “possible that [she] did not receive the proper legal advice.” These statements are insufficient to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, particularly in the absence of any indication of substantial compliance with the procedures set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005). We recognize that the respondent has since taken steps to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, but this does not alter our conclusion that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s motion to reconsider does not identify any error in her previous decision denying the motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2) (a motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority”); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, we likewise affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
*2 We acknowledge the respondent’s contention on appeal that her case should be deferred pending the possible implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”) program. A request for prosecutorial discretion lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

As the Immigration Judge noted in her November 13, 2014, decision, because the respondent filed a motion to reopen during the voluntary departure period granted pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b), the grant of voluntary departure is terminated automatically. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(iii). The respondent has not challenged this conclusion on appeal.

IN RE: RAQUEL LUZIA FERREIRA PEREIRA
File: AXXX XX2 663 - Boston, MA
September 1, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vard R. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 14, 2015, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings conducted in absentia on January 5, 2010.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file an opposition to the motion or to this appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that a Notice to Appear (NTA) was served on the respondent by regular mail on September 30, 2009, to the address2 that she provided on her application for adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen (Form I-485), dated October 22, 2004, and the NTA was not returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1, 3; Exhs. 1, 2). The respondent was subsequently sent a notice of hearing (NOH) by regular mail to that same address on December 18, 2009, informing the respondent of a January 5, 2010, hearing date, and that notice was returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1). The respondent did not appear for her hearing, and on January 5, 2010, an in absentia order of removal was entered and mailed to the respondent via regular mail, again to the same address, and it was returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1). On June 24, 2014, the respondent, through counsel Micol Mion Gordon, Esquire, filed a motion to reopen in which the respondent alleged that she was denied due process because the NTA was issued years after her Form I-485 was denied.
 
In his December 14, 2015, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent failed to rebut the presumption that the NTA was delivered to her last known address at 9 Marney Street. In particular, the Immigration Judge noted that the NTA had not been returned by the postal service, and while the NOH had been returned by the postal service, the respondent had provided no evidence to support her assertion that she had moved to a new address.
 
We first observe that the respondent has a legal obligation to provide an address at which she can be contacted. See section 239(a)(1)(F)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F)(i). In addition, we have held that an alien can be charged with receiving proper notice when notice “reaches the correct address but does not reach the alien through some failure in the internal workings of the household.” Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001).
 
*2 We presume that a properly addressed notice sent via regular mail is received by the addressee. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). The Board considers all relevant evidence in determining whether an alien has rebutted the presumption. Such includes but is not limited to factors such as affidavits from the respondent and others who are knowledgeable about whether notice was received, whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation, any prior applications for relief that would indicate an incentive to appear, and the respondent’s prior appearance at immigration proceedings, if applicable. See also Shah v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2008); Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008).
 
In the respondent’s motion to reopen of June 24, 2014, the respondent admitted in her motion that she received the DHS denial of her Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) mailed on October 15, 2005, which had been mailed to her 9 Marney Street address, and she averred that she kept receiving mail at that address even after she physically moved out. The respondent alleged that it was a denial of her due process for a NTA to be issued over a year after the Form I-485 had been denied. The respondent further alleged that she did not discover her in absentia order until she hired counsel apparently recently in furtherance of a new Form I-485 filing. No affidavit or other evidence accompanied the motion.
 
On appeal, the respondent now files a new motion to reopen predicated upon ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) by her prior counsel, Ms. Gordon. The respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent alleges that Ms. Gordon committed IAC by failing to provide the respondent’s affidavit and other evidence with the June 24, 2014, motion to reopen.
 
The respondent has proffered an affidavit, dated February 3, 2016, in which she alleges that she did not receive the NTA or the NOH, and she further alleges that she moved from 9 Marney Street in April 2005. The respondent also lists the addresses to which she purportedly moved since then. The respondent avers that she received the October 15, 2005, DHS denial of her Form I-485 mailed to the 9 Marney Street address because although she was no longer living there, a “resident at that address called” and the respondent picked it up from that resident.
 
The respondent has also proffered a statement from her prior counsel, Ms. Gordon, in response to the IAC allegations. In Ms. Gordon’s statement, she asserts that she determined that it was unwise and unethical to submit an affidavit from the respondent given her inability to conclusively tell counsel where she lived and when. Ms. Gordon also provided notes showing the list of addresses and dates provided by the respondent and they are at least in part inconsistent with the dates and addresses the respondent now provides in her IAC claim. Ms. Gordon further notes that she contacted the respondent’s friend, Cristina Lira, who continued to reside at 9 Marney Street, and Ms. Lira was unable to confirm whether she had received the NTA, and thus Ms. Gordon determined that she could not submit an affidavit from Ms. Lira. The respondent has proffered an affidavit, dated March 9, 2016, in rebuttal to Ms. Gordon’s statement. The respondent avers that Ms. Gordon never told the respondent that her information was unreliable or that evidence in support of the motion was needed.
 
*3 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen, for the reasons stated therein. Most significantly, here the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s evidence with the motion to reopen and found that the respondent had failed to rebut the presumption of proper delivery under Matter of M-R-A-, supra. The respondent has not demonstrated that she had an incentive to appear, where her application for adjustment of status had been previously denied, or that she exercised due diligence in inquiring into her immigration status. See also Matter of C-R-C-, supra (holding that the respondent overcame the presumption of delivery of a Notice to Appear sent by regular mail where he submitted an affidavit stating that he did not receive the notice, additional evidence indicating he had an incentive to appear, and by exercising due diligence in promptly obtaining counsel and requesting reopening of the proceedings).
 
We will also deny the motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent has not established deficient performance and further has failed to establish that she was prejudiced by Ms. Gordon’s representation. See Muyubisnay-Cungachi v. Holder, 734 F.3d 66 (1st Cir. 2013) (an alien bringing an ineffective assistance claim based on counsel’s performance during removal proceedings must establish both a deficient performance by counsel and a reasonable probability of prejudice resulting from his former representation); Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (stating that “to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioners must show ‘a reasonable probability of prejudice’ resulting from their former representation”).
 
First, the respondent’s counsel informs that the Office of Bar Counsel has determined that it would not go forward with the complaint against Ms. Gordon as the asserted ethical violations did not rise to the magnitude it requires for a full grievance and hearing proceeding. Second, Ms. Gordon credibly explains her actions regarding the motion to reopen she filed, and her strategic decision not to include an affidavit from the respondent or her friend. Indeed, counsel’s strategic decision in this regard is not the type of conduct typically held to be “ineffective assistance.” See Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113, 127 n. 7 (BIA 1998) (citing Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1984)) (ineffective assistance counsel claim rejected where attorney made informed, strategic decision). Third, Ms. Gordon’s statement and her notes attached establish inconsistencies in the respondent’s assertions as to where she resided since 2001. Fourth, the respondent has not provided a statement from her friend who continued to reside at 9 Marney Street, to corroborate that she did not receive the NTA; nor has she provided objective corroboration for the addresses at which she claims to have resided, with the exception of the 68 Linden Street address. Consequently, the respondent has not met her burden to overcome the presumption of delivery of the NTA.
 
*4 The formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied in certain circumstances where the respondent is eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing and did not receive oral warnings in his/her native language regarding the bar to future discretionary relief that arises from a failure to appear. See generally Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). In such cases, the motion to reopen is subject to the 90 day filing deadline set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent’s in absentia removal order was entered on January 5, 2010. The June 24, 2014, motion was thus long past the 90 day deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen seeking new relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been presented to warrant sua sponte reopening. Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tabitha Villarrubia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elizabeth Treacy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (conceded)
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 18, 2014, decision denying his motion for a continuance and ordering him removed. He also requests remand of the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider his request for a continuance of these proceedings based on new evidence. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed; and the motion to remand, denied.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for additional time to investigate possible eligibility for a derivative U nonimmigrant visa (Respondent’s Brief at 4-7; Respondent’s December 18, 2014, Motion to Continue at 2-3). See generally section 101(a)(15)(U)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(ii) (allowing certain relatives, including spouses, of the victims of qualifying crimes to establish eligibility for U nonimmigrant status as derivative beneficiaries).
 
The Immigration Judge has broad discretion to grant a continuance for good cause. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. We will not overturn an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a continuance unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). We consider the following factors when addressing continuances sought to apply for a U visa: (1) the DHS’s response to the continuance motion; (2) whether the underlying visa petition is prima facie approvable; and (3) the reason for the continuance and other procedural factors. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 812-813 (BIA 2012). Here, the DHS opposed the respondent’s motion to continue before the Immigration Judge and reaffirms the opposition on appeal (DHS Brief at 6-8; Tr. at 13-14). We, therefore, consider the remaining factors as outlined in Matter of Sanchez Sosa, supra, at 812-13.
 
*2 First, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that, based on the record as constituted before her, the respondent did not show his prima facie eligibility for derivative U visa status (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent was not then married to the potential principal U visa applicant (I.J. at 3-4; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 3). See section 101(a)(15)(U)(ii)(II) of the Act. When coupled with the fact that the respondent’s fiancée had not yet filed an application for a U visa or obtained a signed law enforcement certificate (“LEC”), the Immigration Judge reasonably concluded that the respondent’s potential U visa eligibility was speculative (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i) (noting that an applicant for a U visa must submit a signed LEC attesting that the applicant has been a victim of a qualifying crime and has been, is being, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the crime); see also Matter of Sanchez Sosa, supra, at 811.
 
Second, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge did not properly consider, when denying his continuance request, that he had obtained new counsel approximately two weeks prior to his final hearing (Respondent’s Brief at 5, 7; I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 2). The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the respondent had new counsel, and nonetheless found further continuances unwarranted (I.J. at 2-4). Specifically, the Immigration Judge considered the length of the respondent’s removal proceedings, the fact that he had been represented by counsel at all of his hearings, and the 18-month continuance granted at the previous hearing for the respondent to prepare any forms of relief for which he may have been eligible (I.J. at 2-4; Tr. at 9, 11).
 
Further, the respondent argues the Immigration Judge did not consider that his identification documents were stolen, and thus he could not marry his fiancée prior to the scheduled hearing because he was awaiting replacements (Respondent’s Brief at 5; I.J. at 3-4; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 3). Notwithstanding the respondent’s argument, we are unpersuaded by his assertion that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s continuance denial (Respondent’s Brief at 3; I.J. at 3-4). See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983) (“[A]n immigration judge’s decision denying the motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that that denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.”); see also Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra, at 434. Notably, as outlined above, even setting aside that he and his fiancée had not yet married, the respondent did not otherwise establish prima facie eligibility for derivative U visa classification.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent was not denied a full and fair hearing.1 See Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra, at 434. We, therefore, affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to continue.
 
The respondent also seeks remand based on new evidence that he is now married and his wife is the beneficiary of a signed LEC (Respondent’s Brief at 7, Tab A).2 Notably, notwithstanding the passage of time, the respondent has not otherwise presented evidence establishing his or his wife’s prima facie eligibility for U visa classification. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, supra, at 811, 814-15 (explaining that (1) the principal applicant has the burden to establish prima facie eligibility; (2) any U visa applicant must establish that he is admissible or that he has sought and qualifies for any necessary waivers of inadmissibility; and (3) as appropriate, the applicant should generally provide the Immigration Judge with any completed U visa applications and filing receipts issued by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to demonstrate that he is prosecuting his U visa application and is prima facie eligible for this benefit); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b), (c)(2), (c)(4). Because the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for a U visa, we will deny his request for remand. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992) (holding that the Board may deny a motion to remand where prima facie eligibility for relief is not established); see also 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b) (discussing requirements for a U visa).3
 
We will not address the respondent’s argument on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for voluntary departure, as the respondent specifically declined to seek this relief at his final hearing (Respondent’s Brief at 3; Tr. at 14-15). See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 457 (BIA 2011); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007). Similarly, although the respondent generally maintains he is eligible for cancellation of removal for certain non-permanent residents under section 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), we note that he has not submitted any persuasive evidence, or even made a proffer, to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for this benefit (Notice of Appeal). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*4 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

Although the respondent alleged on the Notice of Appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not pursue this argument in his brief nor did he comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), requirements (Notice of Appeal From a Decision of an Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-26)). See Guzman-Rivadeneira v. Lynch, 822 F.3d 978, 983-84 (7th Cir. 2016) (requiring compliance with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, as necessary in showing ineffective assistance of counsel). Therefore, we will not address this issue further. See Matter of G-G-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 339, 340 n.2 (BIA 2014).

We take administrative notice of the respondent’s February 20, 2015, marriage and the existence of a signed LEC executed by the Marion County Deputy Prosecutor (Respondent’s Brief at Tab A). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting our appellate fact-finding authority to “taking administrative notice of commonly known facts such as . . . the contents of official documents”); Matter of S-H-, supra, at 465-66.

The respondent also claims eligibility for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”) (Notice of Appeal). This relief is currently unavailable. See Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733 (5th Cir. 2015) (denying motion to stay preliminary injunction of DAPA); aff’d by equally divided Court per curiam, 136 S.Ct. 2271 (2016). In addition, any request for prosecutorial discretion must be directed to the DHS, as the DHS has sole authority over such a request. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Youry Ziankovich, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative order in this matter was entered by the Board on February 24, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal,1 and reinstated his 60-day period of voluntary departure that was granted by the Immigration Judge. On May 19, 2016, he filed a motion to reopen asserting eligibility for adjustment of status based on the visa petition filed by his current United States citizen wife. It is also alleged that the respondent received ineffective assistance from former counsel in his proceedings before the Immigration Judge and in conjunction with his Board appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was filed more than 90 days after we rendered the final administrative decision in his case on February 24, 2015. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). He also has not demonstrated that his motion falls within any exception to the 90-day filing deadline, as provided for under the statute and regulations. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i)-(iv).
 
In moving to reopen, it is asserted that the respondent received ineffective assistance by former counsel who, it is said, did not timely notify him that his Board appeal had been dismissed, and that his 60-day period of voluntary departure had been reinstated. Motion to Reopen (Motion) at #4, #15-16, #22-25. However, his submissions do not demonstrate satisfaction with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.2
 
We also decline to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte, as there has been no showing of exceptional circumstances warranting such action. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). Becoming eligible for adjustment of status after entry of an alien’s final administrative decision does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting reopening on our own motion. Moreover, the respondent has not shown that the visa petition filed by his current USC wife has been approved. Thus, he has not demonstrated current prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status.3
 
*2 It is also claimed that former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not pursuing an asylum application for the respondent at his removal hearing, and that this constitutes exceptional circumstances justifying sua sponte reopening. Motion at #28-32. This contention has been advanced by current counsel, not the respondent himself. It is well settled that statements by counsel do not constitute evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980); Matter of Laureano; 19 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 1983), n. 2. In any event, as noted above, there has been no showing of compliance with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance by former counsel in accordance with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
We further observe that the respondent has not requested or demonstrated eligibility for reopening to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions/circumstances arising in Tajikistan since his last hearing that materially affect his current eligibility for such relief. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).
 
Finally, we deny the request to “rescind” the respondent’s order of removal. Motion at #1. The respondent does not deny that he is removable as charged, as found by the Immigration Judge. He also has not demonstrated eligibility for relief from removal.
 
Insofar as the respondent seeks a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, or a stay of removal based on his personal circumstances, he must direct his requests to the DHS.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

On appeal, the respondent challenged the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance, which he sought so that an appeal could be filed of the denial of the second visa petition filed in his behalf by his first United States citizen wife.

2

The respondent does not argue that the 90-day filing deadline for his motion to reopen is equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance by former counsel. In addition, he has not cited any controlling circuit law establishing that the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit applies the doctrine of equitable tolling in cases such as this. In any event, he has not demonstrated compliance with Matter of Lozada, id., regarding claims of ineffective assistance by attorney Brett Davies, who last represented him at his hearing and on appeal.

3

The respondent also has not squarely addressed whether he is now precluded from adjustment of status consideration pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), due to his failure to depart the country prior to expiration of his voluntary departure period.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James A. Benzoni, Esquire
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 21, 2015, summary order, which stated that he had waived the right to appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed, based on lack of jurisdiction, as the respondent waived the right to appeal to the Board.
 
The Immigration Judge granted a period of pre-hearing voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), and. noted that the respondent had waived the right to appeal to the Board. Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (grant of voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act requires a waiver of the right to appeal); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(D). The transcript of proceedings shows that the respondent, represented by counsel, waived appeal after assuring the Immigration Judge that he had explained to the respondent that a waiver meant that the order would be final (Tr. at 10-11). On August 17, 2015, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26).1
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
The respondent fails to show that the waiver was invalid. As noted, the respondent was represented by counsel at the final hearing on July 21, 2015. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, supra, at 1322-23.
 
The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore did not knowingly waive the right to appeal to the Board. However, he fails to show prejudice resulting from the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. Valencia v. Holder, 657 F.3d 745, 749 (8th Cir. 2011), citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for any relief available to him in removal proceedings.
 
*2 At the July 21, 2015, removal hearing, counsel conceded that the respondent was ineligible for any relief in removal proceedings and was continuing to prepare his U non-immigrant visa application (Tr. at 9). Counsel for the respondent therefore pursued a grant of voluntary departure, and waived appeal (Tr. at 9-11).
 
The respondent’s brief seeks to allege ineffective assistance of counsel with regards to the respondent’s application for a U non-immigrant visa, but does not address any error in his prior counsel’s concession that the respondent’s only eligible relief in removal proceedings is voluntary departure.
 
Applicable regulations pertaining to U-visas state clearly that “USCIS has sole jurisdiction over all petitions for U nonimmigrant status.” 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). In addition, with regard to aliens subject to a final order of removal, the regulations make clear that an alien with an outstanding removal order may nevertheless pursue a petition for a U-visa with the USCIS and that the alien “may file a request for a stay of removal” with the USCIS pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a) and 8 C.F.R. § 1241.6(a). 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). Neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over a U-visa petition. Thus, the respondent has not established prejudice from prior counsel’s actions or inactions.
 
The appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and the record of proceedings is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

The respondent subsequently filed a motion to remand with the Board on October 29, 2016. However, since we lack jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal, we lack jurisdiction over his motion to remand.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anthony M. Giordano, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Fen Lu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 20, 2014, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On May 13, 2016, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent, however, argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance by attorney George Echevarria, who represented him before the Immigration Judge, on appeal, and in his prior motion to reopen. The respondent also argues that the motion should be granted because the form I-130 visa petition filed by his lawful permanent resident spouse was approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in February 2016. We will address these arguments in turn.
 
First, the respondent argues that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance. However, the respondent has not shown that he has sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s affidavit submitted in support of the motion states that the former counsel “has been provided with a copy of this affidavit and has not responded to date” (Motion Exh. H, at ¶ 5). The respondent, however, has not explained how former counsel was provided a copy of “this affidavit,” which states that former counsel was provided with a copy of the document and has not responded. The respondent also has not presented other documentary evidence showing that his statement regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claim was provided to the former counsel, or when.
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not explained how he was prejudiced by the former counsel’s performance. Although former counsel appears to have continued to represent the respondent until at least February 2016 (see Motion Exh. E), the respondent has not explained how his recent performance was inadequate or how he was prejudiced by such ineffective assistance. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel appears to be related only to the denial of a continuance by the Immigration Judge at his October 31, 2011, hearing date. The respondent has not explained why he did not file an ineffective assistance of counsel claim earlier regarding the alleged deficient performance in 2011. See, e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008) (discussing due diligence in filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*2 The respondent’s statement submitted with the motion states that on October 31, 2011, the day of his previous hearing, the former counsel “was not ready to go forward and as a result the [Immigration] Court decided to order me removed” and, although the former counsel filed a motion to continue the case and provided proof of mailing the motion, “the [Immigration] Court indicated that it did not receive the motion and also that other papers were not filed by the deadline set by the [Immigration] Court” (Motion Exh. H, at ¶¶ 3-4; see Tr. at 37). However, the respondent states that he decided not to file a bar complaint against the former counsel because he “made an innocent mistake calendaring the matter” (Motion Exh. H, at ¶ 6). The respondent further admits that, at the October 31, 2011, hearing date, he had not provided supporting documents for his cancellation of removal application that had been requested by the former counsel, and that would have been “critical” to the success of the respondent’s case (id.). The respondent, therefore, has not made “a prima facie showing that he would have been eligible for the relief and that he could have made a strong showing in support of his application,” such that he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel.1 Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994). Based on the above, the respondent has not shown that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of the former counsel.
 
We will next address the respondent’s arguments based on the approval of a Form i-130 visa petition filed by his lawful permanent resident spouse and seeking adjustment of status. This aspect of the motion does not fall within any exception to the motion to reopen time limitations enumerated in section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The respondent urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), based on the circumstances of his case, including the claim of former counsel’s ineffective assistance, the USCIS delay in adjudicating the visa petition, and other factors. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The record also shows that there was concern about the respondent’s eligibility for cancellation of removal, in light of his criminal record (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 40-41). The respondent’s motion does not address the issue of whether he would have been statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal on October 31, 2011. The respondent’s statement only suggests that a sex offense charge in 1997 has been dismissed but this was not reflected in the documentary evidence available in 2011 (Motion Exh. H, at ¶ 6.c).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan Michael Anzarouth, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. The Immigration Judge entered the final administrative order in this case on October 22, 2014, when he granted the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure in lieu of a removal order. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent filed the present motion on May 10, 2016, over 1 year after the Immigration Judge’s final decision, and a prior motion to reopen was denied by the Immigration Judge on December 19, 2014. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent urges that the time and number limits should be equitably tolled with regard to his motion because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The time and number limits for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where an alien raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). An alien must, however, demonstrate that he or she has been prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. Id.; Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); see also Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (an alien can show prejudice where counsel’s performance “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In this case, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective representation of his prior counsels. The respondent has not supported his motion with any applications for relief, including an asylum application as required by regulation nor has he articulated a basis for such relief. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1), (3)(ii). Thus, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s alleged fear of harm in Mexico is adequately supported. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988) (a motion to reopen may be denied if alien does not establish prima facie case for the relief sought); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (to prevail on a motion to reopen an alien must establish that “the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case”). Further, statements of counsel in a brief or motion are not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Consequently, the respondent has not demonstrated that the outcome might have been affected by his prior counsels. In addition, given this lack of evidence, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rahul Dev Manchanda, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, appeals from the February 11, 2016, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (Form I-862) on December 14, 1999, and was ordered removed after a hearing held in absentia on May 11, 2001 (Exhs. 1K, 2K). He filed a motion to reopen on September 11, 2015, arguing that he was previously subject to ineffective assistance of counsel. We point out, as did the Immigration Judge, that the respondent states that he met the attorney in question in 2006, many years after the in absentia order was issued (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge found that any alleged ineffective assistance in 2006 has no bearing on the legitimacy of the order of removal entered in absentia in 2001 (I.J. at 3). The respondent has not addressed the Immigration Judge’s finding in this regard.
 
In general, a motion to reopen is required to be filed within 90 days of a final decision. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). To rescind an order of removal entered in absentia, a respondent must file a motion within 180 days demonstrating that his failure to appear at the hearing was “because of exceptional circumstances.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). The motion may be filed at any time, if the respondent demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing. Id. The respondent, here, has made no claim that he did not receive notice nor has he presented any claim to exceptional circumstances that prevented him from appearing in 2001. As noted above, the respondent claims that his attorney from 2006 was ineffective, but does not address his failure to appear in 2001. See Exhs. 1K, 2K.
 
The respondent requests that the proceedings be reopened to allow him to establish eligibility for adjustment of status, and asylum and related relief and protection. As observed by the Immigration Judge, although a visa petition has apparently been filed on his behalf, there is no indication that it has been approved (I.J. at 4). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status, nor would newly available relief be a basis to reopen proceedings. Moreover, as the respondent seeks equitable tolling to remedy the untimeliness of his motion, the respondent has not met the requirement of establishing due diligence. See Mezo v. Holder, 615 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir. 2010); Tapia-Matinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417, 422-24 (6th Cir. 2007). The respondent was ordered removed in 2001, married in 2004, and has presented no reason for not contacting an attorney regarding his case until 2006. More significantly, however, is that even if his attorney in 2006 was ineffective, the respondent did not contact his current attorney until 2015. He has presented no reasons for this delay.
 
*2 A motion to reopen to apply for asylum and withholding of removal is not subject to the filing deadline if it is based on changed conditions arising within the country to which deportation has been ordered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013). However, the evidence must be new and material and not have been available for presentation at the previous hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Also, the motion must be filed within a reasonable period after the changed circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii); Matter of T-M-H- & S-W-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 193 (BIA 2010).
 
The respondent has not met this burden. As observed by the Immigration Judge, it does not appear the respondent submitted an asylum application with his motion to reopen (I.J. at 3). The record contains the respondent’s submission, numbered pages 1 through 95, but there is no asylum application. He has submitted an asylum application on appeal. However, the brief comments on the application concerning the government of Ghana, the respondent’s fear of Muslim extremists, and his claim that he knows some people who were killed, with no supporting evidence, does not establish how country conditions have materially changed since his hearing, or that he could establish a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum. The respondent has not met his heavy burden of showing reopening is warranted. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314(1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
Finally, there is no merit to the respondent’s claim that he has presented extraordinary circumstances that support our reopening the proceedings sua sponte. Sua sponte reopening is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Rais v. Holder, 768 F.3d 453, 460 (6th Cir. 2014) (sua sponte authority is available only “in exceptional situations”); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1137 (BIA 1999) (an alien’s ability to become eligible for adjustment of status due to the passage of time after a failure to voluntarily depart is not an exceptional situation); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also INS v. Doherty, supra (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien). The respondent was ordered removed in 2001, failed to appear for his hearing, and remained in this country illegally. The fact that he has equities in this country, including his family, and may potentially be eligible for relief at some point, does not present such circumstances. See Matter of G-D-, supra.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian A. Seyfried, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle M. Venci
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on November 10, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On July 13, 2016, more than VA years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent, however, argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Jorge A. Rodriguez, his former counsel who represented him at hearing and on appeal.
 
We will first address the respondent’s argument that he should be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), because the former counsel was suspended from the practice of law. The respondent argues that, because the former counsel was already suspended, he could not contact the former counsel to inform him about the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and it would be futile to file a bar complaint against him (Motion, at LA1). However, a document submitted with the motion regarding the former counsel, which appears to have been printed out on June 24, 2016, contains the former counsel’s contact information with his business address and telephone numbers (Motion Exh. C, at 8). Furthermore, although the former counsel was suspended from the practice of law for a specified period from October 16, 2013, to November 15, 2013, documents submitted by both the respondent and the DHS show that he is currently “active” and authorized to practice law (Motion Exh. C; DHS Opp. Attachment). Under these circumstances, the respondent’s explanations on why he should be deemed to have complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, are unfounded and insufficient.
 
In addition, the respondent’s motion is untimely as noted above, and the respondent has not shown how he has exercised due diligence since the Board’s final administrative decision before filing the motion to reopen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has required that, while a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel may be subject to equitable tolling of the motion time limitations, an alien must demonstrate “““due diligence” in order to succeed on a claim for equitable tolling. El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2012); Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006). The respondent’s motion prepared by the counsel suggests that the respondent was not aware of the final order of removal until he was taken into immigration custody, which occurred in 2016 (Motion, I.B). However, counsel’s statement in a motion or brief is not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Furthermore, the respondent’s statement submitted with the motion states that in 2013 he was aware of the order of removal and appealed the decision, although the appeal was unsuccessful (Motion Exh. A, at ¶ 92). Therefore, the respondent has not shown that he was not aware of the order of removal until 2016, or that he has practiced due diligence.
 
*2 Even if the respondent’s motion were to be considered timely and the respondent had complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is unsupported by the record of his case. The respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not telling him about his final hearing date at the Immigration Court, which was March 6, 2013 (Motion, I.A.1; Motion Exh. A, at ¶¶ 6-8, 11). However, the record of proceedings of this case shows that the respondent did attend his March 6, 2013, hearing with the former counsel (Tr. at 29). The record also shows that the respondent was orally advised of the Immigration Judge’s decision and his appeal rights through an interpreter (Tr. at 29, 39-40). Therefore, the respondent’s factual assertions regarding ineffective assistance of former counsel are unfounded and contradicted by the record of this case.3
 
In sum, the respondent has not shown that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not informing him of his hearing date at the Immigration Court. The respondent also has not shown that the motion to reopen time limitations should be equitably tolled in his case, or that contacting the former counsel or filing a bar complaint in compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, was impossible and/or futile. Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent’s motion was not paginated as required in Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual, § 3.3(c)(iii) at 40 (Apr. 26, 2016) (“Briefs and other submission should always be paginated”).

2

The respondent’s “Affidavit” was purported to have been made under penalties of perjury, but it contains no signature by anyone, and was not sworn to by anyone before an officer authorized to administer oaths (Motion Exh. A). Therefore, it does not qualify as an affidavit. Even if were to assume that this statement was actually from the respondent and therefore constitutes “““evidence,” it still would not support the factual assertions in the motion as noted above.

3

We also note that the respondent’s current counsel had made a request to review the respondent’s record of proceedings at the Immigration Court in June 2016, thus he would have been in a position to be apprised of the record of this case before filing the current motion to reopen (Motion Exh. B).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Romy L. Lerner, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Timothy M. Cole
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to Suppress; motion to terminate; motion to retract and substitute
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated February 25, 2015, which denied his motion to retract and amend his declaration in support of his prior motion to suppress, and ordered him removed from the United States to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a response to the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). Considering the arguments advanced on appeal and the lack of clear error in the Immigration Judge’s factual findings, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act.
 
As background, the respondent initially filed a motion to suppress before the Immigration Judge on March 24, 2014. Therein, he argued, inter alia, that the DHS’ Form I-213 arose from an illegal arrest, and he sought to terminate proceedings. However, the respondent attached a declaration to his motion which admitted that he was “born in San Geronimo de los Dolores, Mexico, on June 28, 1986.” Thereafter, on April 7, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to retract this declaration, and to substitute a similar declaration without the respondent’s admission of alienage. In a decision dated May 20, 2014, the Immigration Judge found “no just cause” to grant the motion to retract and substitute the respondent’s declarations, and, relying on the respondent’s declaration of alienage, he found the motion to suppress moot (May 20, 2014, I.J. Dec. at 2). The Immigration Judge then shifted the burden to the respondent, under section 291 of the Act, to establish time, place, and manner of entry. See 8 C/F/R. § 1240.8(c). In a pleading dated January 16, 2015, the respondent did not deny his alienage, but also declined to offer evidence on the time, place or manner of his entry. The Immigration Judge ultimately found, in a decision dated February 25, 2015, that the respondent had conceded his alienage and that he had not demonstrated that he had any lawful status in the United States (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 2-3). Inasmuch as the respondent also did not seek relief from removal, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 3).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not allowing him to retract and amend the statement in his motion to suppress which stated that the respondent was from Mexico. The respondent argues, inter alia, that the admission was a “clerical mistake” evidenced by the fact that the basis of his entire motion to suppress involved the suppression of his alienage. In support of his argument, the respondent relies heavily on the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure to argue the fairness of allowing the respondent to retract his admission.
 
In response, the DHS argues that Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) controls the outcome of the respondent’s case. We agree. In Velasquez, the Board held that an alien’s lawyer’s admissions in immigration proceedings are binding absent “egregious circumstances.” The Velasquez exception may apply to a concession that (1) was “the result of unreasonable professional judgment,” (2) was so unfair that it produced an unjust result, or (3) was untrue or incorrect. Id.; see also Guzman v. Lynch, 822 F.3d 978 (7th Cir. 2016); Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820, 831-32 (9th Cir.2011); Hanna v. Holder, 740 F.3d 379, 387-88 (6th Cir.2014) (“as a threshold matter” the alien must argue “that the factual admissions or concessions of removability are untrue or incorrect,” and that they came from unreasonable professional judgment or produced an unjust result).
 
The respondent does not allege that his admission in incorrect; in fact, as the DHS argues on appeal, the evidence sought to be suppressed by the respondent also indicates that he was born in Mexico on June 28, 1986 (DHS Exh. B). The undisputed truth of the respondent’s declaration of alienage does not unjustly result in his removal; moreover, because the respondent’s attorney explains the inclusion of the respondent’s alienage as a “clerical error”, we also find that no unreasonable professional judgment was involved in the respondent’s admission.1 As such, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s reliance on the respondent’s admission of alienage, and no egregious circumstances which would support the respondent’s request to retract this admission. As such, because alienage was established, we also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate that the respondent by clear and convincing evidence that that he is lawfully in the United States pursuant to a prior admission. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s order to remove the respondent from the United States to Mexico under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, and the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that the Seventh Circuit in Guzman v. Lynch, supra, recognized possible overlap between the Velasquez exception and the ineffective assistance of counsel requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 18 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not set forth a Lozada claim, but we note that such guidelines require a different standard of effectiveness and prejudice.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Olivieri Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James E. Manning
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case is before us pursuant to an August 28, 2015, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The court granted the government’s unopposed motion to remand the record for reconsideration of the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion to reopen proceedings. We had dismissed the appeal on August 20, 2014. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident on September 29, 1989. On September 22, 2004, he was convicted in Texas for possession of cocaine. The respondent was issued a Notice to Appear on the next day. On December 7, 2004, the respondent was ordered removed under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated felony) and 237(a)(2)(B)(i) (controlled substance violation) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i). The respondent appealed this decision to the Board, but withdrew his appeal as the Board recognized on February 3, 2005. The respondent was then removed from the United States.
 
In 2014, subsequent to his departure from the United States, the respondent filed a motion to reopen the proceedings.1 The respondent’s motion was untimely under the general rule requiring aliens to file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion because it was untimely, and he also found that he did not have jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings sua sponte due to the respondent’s departure from the United States (I.J. at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
In our decision dismissing the appeal, we found that under the law of the Fifth Circuit, any claim to equitable tolling of the motion’s deadline is construed as a challenge to the exercise of our regulatory power to reopen the proceedings sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (BIA at 2, citing, Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008)). Since the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision and our decision in this case, the Supreme Court has ruled that a request for equitable tolling of the motion’s deadline is a separate request from one for sua sponte reopening. Mata v. Lynch, 135 S.Ct. 2150 (2015). Rather, the request is grounded in the statutory right to a motion to reopen. Mata v. Lynch, supra.
 
*2 However, as discussed above, under the statute, the motion is untimely. We, therefore, consider the respondent’s separate request for equitable tolling of the filing deadline. See Mata v. Lynch, supra; Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 2016 WL 4056051 (5th Cir. July 28, 2016). There are insufficient grounds to apply equitable tolling to the case before us. The removal order in this case was final on December 7, 2004, as the respondent decided to withdraw his appeal to the Board. The changes in law he relies upon occurred in 2006 (Resp. Br. at 7). See Lopez v. Gonzalez, supra. The motion to reopen was not filed until 2014. He argues he was out of the United States and, therefore, was in a different class of individuals who were unaware of the change in law. However, the record provides little evidence of any due diligence on the part of the respondent over the many years between the change in the law and the filing of his motion, shortly after he was again detained by immigration officers. The respondent did not exercise due diligence such that equitable tolling should apply in this case. See United States v. English, 400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 2005) (noting that “equitable tolling is only appropriate in ‘rare and exceptional circumstances”DD’); Lambert v. United States, 44 F.3d 296, 299 & n. 1 (5th Cir. 1995) (requiring due diligence); see also Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, supra, at 5. In this regard, we note the strong policy interest in the finality of immigration proceedings. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988).
 
The respondent has also failed to show any past ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the respondent now argues that his crime is no longer considered an aggravated felony and he was not removable for this offense and not barred from relief under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, this was not the case. He was not ineffectively served by his previous counsel as, at the time of his hearing, the conviction was for an aggravated felony under the law of the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, his attorney properly conceded that the respondent was ineligible for relief from removal. Further, whether or not the respondent’s crime is now considered an aggravated felony, he remained removable for a controlled substance offense. Contrary to his claims on appeal (Resp. Br. at 17-19), this case does not present a gross miscarriage of justice. The respondent was removable as charged and, at that time, was not eligible for any relief from removal due to his aggravated felony conviction.
 
*3 Regardless of any change in law pertaining to the classification of the respondent’s conviction as an aggravated felony, he remains removable as charged for being convicted of an offense related to a controlled substance. See section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. The respondent’s final administrative removal order was lawfully executed upon his departure from the United States. We find, separate from the issue of whether equitable tolling should apply, that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance which would warrant sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hannah E. Stone, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 21, 2015, denying the respondent’s May 20, 2015, motion to reopen her April 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a brief in response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that a December 29, 2014, Notice of Hearing (NOH) for a February 12, 2015, hearing was served on the respondent while in DHS custody (I.J. at 3). On January 20, 2015, a NOH informing of the changed hearing date of April 21, 2015, was mailed to the Fresno, California address the respondent provided in her Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 21, 2015, when she failed to appear. Service by mail is sufficient if the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F). Section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c). As notice was properly provided, and as the respondent failed to appear for her hearing, the Immigration Judge properly issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
On May 5, 2015, the respondent filed a Form EOIR-33, Alien’s Change of Address reflecting a Manson, Washington address. On May 20, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In the respondent’s motion to reopen, she alleged in her affidavit that she filed an updated address with the Immigration Court on April 8, 2015, but “never received in the mail any information from the Immigration Court telling me when I had court” and “never knew when I had to go to court” (Respondent’s Declaration). The Immigration Judge properly denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent’s move in April 2015 did not relieve her from appearing at her hearing, noting that the NOH was not returned as undeliverable by the postal service, and concluding that the respondent failed to establish lack of proper notice and further did not establish that exceptional circumstances prevented her appearance.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent now presents a new theory, which is contradictory to the initial claim in her motion to reopen. Specifically, the respondent has proffered a sworn statement on appeal in which she concedes receipt of the NOH for the April 21, 2015, hearing, but she alleges that a “““deportation officer” advised the respondent that if she filed a change of address form with the Immigration Court, the location of her hearing would be changed, and the respondent also avers that she believed that after she filed a change of address, her court date would also change. In her appeal brief, the respondent alleges that her previous counsel erroneously filed a motion to reopen based upon lack of notice rather than exceptional circumstances.
 
The respondent has not established that the proffered statement and allegations on appeal are new and previously unavailable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Bhasin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, to the extent the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of previous counsel, she has failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the alleged ineffective assistance is not plain on the face of the record. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 594, 597-98 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting the importance of the notice and affidavit requirements in assessing the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge, a petitioner must show error and substantial prejudice). Consequently, we find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael E. Kreis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rachel Feuerhammer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen and native of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s March 23, 2016, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings held in absentia by an Immigration Judge on January 19, 2016. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
The respondent alleged that his failure to appear resulted because he mistakenly thought the hearing was for February 24, 2016, and perhaps mistakenly threw away the notice of hearing. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the respondent’s circumstances did not constitute exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear.1 See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); Acquaah v. Holder, 589 F.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir. 2009) (a mistaken belief as to the correct hearing date does not rise to the level of being an exceptional circumstance).
 
On appeal, the respondent’s reliance upon Kaweesa v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 62 (1st Cir. 2006) is misplaced. That case is not binding as it is not a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies. Kaweesa v. Gonzales, supra, is also distinguishable from the facts herein. In Kaweesa, the First Circuit concluded that the Board failed to consider the totality of circumstances and that the alien had shown she was prima facie eligible for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. However, the respondent here, unlike the alien in Kaweesa, has not shown that he has any available relief, despite his averment that he is married to a U.S. citizen and would be eligible for a provisional waiver. In particular, the respondent has provided no evidence of his U.S. citizen spouse or evidence that a Form I-130, Petition for Alien, has been filed on his behalf. In addition, unlike Kaweesa v. Gonzales, supra, here DHS opposes the motion to reopen. Considering the totality of circumstances, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent had failed to establish exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear.
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We attribute the Immigration Judge’s reference to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim to scrivener’s error (I.J. at 2). We find it harmless error, as the Immigration Judge’s analysis of the motion correctly evaluated the respondent’s alleged mistake of hearing date.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andres J. Ortiz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 10, 2016, denying her motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia on December 13, 2005, for her failure to appear for her hearing. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed no reply to the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was personally served on the respondent on June 18, 2005, and the NTA indicates that the respondent was provided oral notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of a failure to appear (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The NTA also reflects that the respondent was informed of, among other things, the statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address.
 
Two Notices of Hearing (“NOH”) dated August 10, 2005, for a December 13, 2005, hearing were mailed to the Redwood, CA address reflected in the respondent’s NTA, and both were returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1). The respondent failed to appear for that hearing. Service by mail is sufficient if the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F). Section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c). As notice was properly provided, and as the respondent failed to appear for her hearing, the Immigration Judge properly issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
The respondent admits that she never resided at the Redwood, CA address, and further admits that she never filed any corrected address with the Immigration Court. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information). As the respondent has not established that she complied with her duty to inform the Immigration Court, within 5 days, of a proper address, she is not entitled to rescission of the order of removal. See section 240 (b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). See also Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 360 (5th Cir. 2009) (an alien’s failure to receive actual notice of a removal hearing due to his neglect of his obligation to keep the immigration court apprised of his current mailing address does not mean that the alien did not receive notice).
 
*2 We find without merit the respondent’s contention that she was not provided oral advisements in the Spanish language. The NTA was personally served on the respondent and the NTA reflects that the respondent was informed of, among other things, the statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address (Exh. 1). The NTA specifically informed the respondent that if she failed to provide updated contact information “then the Government shall not be required to provide you with written notice of your hearing,” and that if she failed to appear at her hearing, which could be held at “any date and time later directed by the Immigration Court, a removal order may be made by the immigration judge in your absence, and you may be arrested and detained by the INS.” Exh. 1. Even accepting as true the respondent’s averments that Spanish oral advisals were not provided, current law does not require that the NTA be in any language other than English to constitute effective notice. See section 239 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229. Moreover, the requirement of oral notice in an alien’s native language is only necessary to trigger the sanctions in section 240(b)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7), which limits an alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief for failure to appear at removal proceedings. Consequently, the NTA and NOH complied with statutory requirements. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, supra.
 
The respondent argues that prior counsel, who filed the motion to reopen, failed to raise the issues the respondent raises in her motion to reconsider. However, the respondent has not specifically alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; nor has she complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not established that her former counsel did not employ a reasonable tactical decision, and as such is not amenable to a finding that the attorney was ineffective. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 681 (1984) (noting that counsel’s informed strategic decisions must be respected if they are based on professional judgment). Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds for reopening. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998).
 
Nor is reopening warranted under Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) as the motion was untimely for purposes of new relief. Id.
 
*3 Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While the respondent has presented some positive factors in support of sua sponte reopening, these factors either individually or in the aggregate do not trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Indeed, many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances). In reaching this conclusion we note that the respondent did not diligently pursue her immigration status as she first filed her motion to reopen proceedings almost 10 years after being ordered removed in absentia, and 2 years after discovering her in absentia order.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: WILSON ANTONIO RIVERA-TORRES
File: AXXX XX1 038 - San Antonio, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charlie E. Carrillo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of July 15, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s May 28, 2015, motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on October 24, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the October 24, 2006, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel, Jose Guerrero, Esquire, on September 18, 2006 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on October 24, 2006. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings through present counsel on May 28, 2015, alleging that he did not receive notice of his hearing. The motion further alleged that prior counsel failed to inform the respondent of his hearing and the respondent noted that he had attempted to file a change of venue request which was rejected by the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding the motion based upon exceptional circumstances was untimely and finding reopening not warranted based upon lack of notice because notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s contention in his motion to reopen, the filing of a Form EOIR-28 constitutes an entrance of appearance for all proceedings, including removal and bond. There is no “limited” appearance of counsel in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). The respondent has not contested the Immigration Judge’s finding in this regard (I.J. at 3), and therefore the issue is deemed abandoned. See Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196-197 n.4 (BIA 1990) (noting that issues not addressed on appeal are deemed waived).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues, inter alia, that it was procedural error not to send the rejection notice of the respondent’s change of venue request to the respondent. However, the record indicates that the rejection notice was indeed mailed to the respondent at the address he provided in the request. Moreover, the fact that the respondent attempted to file a change of venue does not excuse the respondent’s failure to appear at his October 24, 2006, hearing. It is well established that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent from his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. See Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 1985), aff’d, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986) (the submission of a motion for a continuance does not relieve an alien or his attorney of the responsibility to attend a deportation hearing of which they have been given notice). Nor has the respondent related how rejection of his request to change venue is relevant to whether prior counsel received notice of the hearing.
 
*2 The respondent also maintains on appeal that the Immigration Judge failed to consider equitable tolling. The respondent did not expressly argue in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge that his motion should be equitably tolled and thus the Immigration Judge did not err in not addressing this issue. We further note that even if the immigration statutes are subject to equitable tolling, the respondent has failed to show that such tolling would apply here. See Mata v. Lynch, __ U.S. __, 135 S.Ct. 2150, 2156 & n. 3 (2015) (expressing no opinion as to whether the immigration statutes allow equitable tolling). Specifically, the respondent admits that he became aware of his 2006 in absentia order when he was removed in 2010 (Respondent’s Brief, page 5). Consequently, contrary to the respondent’s contention on appeal, we find that he has not established due diligence, because he has not explained why he waited approximately 5 years after discovering his in absentia order to file a motion to reopen. See Medina-Herrera v. Gonzales, 162 Fed. Appx. 329 (5th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (although generally the determination of whether party has exercised due diligence for purposes of equitable tolling requires finding of fact, Board of Immigration Appeals may determine as a matter of law that party failed to exercise due diligence, where facts on the record are undisputed and the result is inarguable). See also Mendoza-Cortez v. Lynch, ___ F.3d ___, No. 15-60332, 2016 WL 3383417, at 1 (5th Cir. June 17, 2016) (even if the time period for filing a motion to reopen may be equitably tolled, alien has not demonstrated that she would be entitled to equitable tolling because she has not shown that she acted with due diligence).
 
An alien may raise ineffective assistance of counsel as a ground for reopening a deportation case “in ‘egregious circumstances.”DD’ Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006) (quoting Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). However, as a procedural prerequisite for the Board or Immigration Judge to consider a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must provide (1) his own affidavit attesting to the facts, including a statement of the terms of the attorney-client agreement; (2) evidence that counsel was informed of the ineffectiveness allegations and allowed an opportunity to respond; and (3) evidence of a disciplinary filing against the offending attorney or an explanation as to why a grievance was not filed.
 
Here, the respondent has not shown that he has fully complied with the Lozada requirements. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding that the Board does not abuse its discretion by requiring compliance with Lozada). First, while the respondent proffered statements regarding his fear of returning to El Salvador (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab O), none outline the terms of the attorney-client agreement he had with his former counsel. Second, while the respondent has proffered evidence on appeal that he communicated with former counsel requesting information, he has not shown that his former counsel has been informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance. Third, while the respondent avers that a complaint against his former counsel has been drafted, he has not shown that the complaint was in fact filed with the state bar. Nor has the respondent explained why the grievance has not been filed. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2014) (finding that Lozada makes clear that the second requirement is only met when counsel is informed of the charge before allegations of ineffective assistance are presented to the Board and finding the alien did not offer sufficient proof to show that his attorney was informed or had a reasonable opportunity to respond before the allegations were presented in his appeal brief to the Board; nor did the alien offer any adequate reason that his failure to follow the rules should be excused).
 
*3 While the Immigration Judge did not expressly address the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim, he found the motion based upon exceptional circumstances to be untimely. Even if there was error by the Immigration Judge, we find that the respondent has failed to show prejudice therefrom. Specifically, the respondent has not established that he is entitled to equitable tolling, and he has not complied with the Lozada procedural requirements, and thus we find the respondent has failed to show prejudice stemming from the Immigration Judge’s failure to address the ineffective assistance claim. See Ogunfuye v. Holder, 610 F.3d 303, 306-07 (5th Cir. 2010) (explaining that the respondent must make a showing of substantial prejudice before he can prevail on a due process claim); De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004) (same). See also Chen v. Gonzales, 157 Fed. Appx. 739, 741 (5th Cir. 2005) (unpublished) (finding that once the Immigration Judge held that the alien’s motion, filed more than four years after the 1999 removal order, was untimely, his discussion of the existence vel non of exceptional circumstances was unnecessary, and any error he may have committed on that score is therefore harmless).
 
Moreover, regarding the respondent’s claimed fear of persecution or torture in El Salvador, the regulations provide specific procedures through which an alien subject to reinstatement may pursue such a claim.1 See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.31, 1241.8(e) (describing procedures for those subject to reinstatement who expresses fear of returning to country of removal); Matter of W-C-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 118, 123 (BIA 2007) (denying motion to remand, noting that procedures are in place for those subject to reinstatement who claimed a fear of returning to country of removal); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1241.8(a)(1) (an immigration officer is required to determine whether “the alien is in fact an alien ...”). The respondent may pursue these applications in such proceedings.
 
Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s finding otherwise, the respondent is not barred by section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), from filing a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings when alleging a lack of notice. See Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009) (Board held that an alien’s departure from the United States while under an outstanding order of deportation or removal issued in absentia does not deprive the Immigration Judge of jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reopen to rescind the order if the motion is premised on lack of notice). Given our findings above, however, we find no prejudicial error.
 
*4 Finally, as noted above, the respondent proffers evidence on appeal. Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, the respondent has not shown that this evidence is new or previously unavailable, or that it could possibly alter the decision in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (holding that a party who seeks a remand to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Therefore, we find that a remand is not warranted.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge Guttlein, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 25, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of a motion to reconsider. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 10, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served personally on the respondent on October 10, 2005 (Exh. 1). On January 30, 2006, the Immigration Court mailed the respondent a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings (NOH) informing him that he had been scheduled for a hearing on February 22, 2006 (Exh. 5). The respondent did not appear for his hearing on February 22, 2006, and the Immigration Judge ordered him removed in absentia. On March 19, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on April 3, 2013. The respondent then filed a motion to reconsider that decision, which the Immigration Judge denied on May 22, 2013. The respondent appealed the denial of the motion to reconsider to the Board, and we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on June 25, 2014. On December 1, 2014, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on April 10, 2015. That decision is the subject of the instant appeal.
 
The respondent’s motion requested that the Immigration Judge reopen proceedings sua sponte1 so that he may pursue voluntary departure, Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, and/or an Application for a Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver (Form I-601 A) based on a recently filed, and since approved, Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130), filed by his United States citizen wife. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(3). The respondent also argued that he received ineffective assistance from prior counsel, which he claimed constitutes an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening of his proceedings.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established an exceptional situation that warrants sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). While the respondent may now be eligible for relief, becoming potentially eligible for relief from removal after a final administrative order, like the respondent has done, is common, and generally does not constitute an exceptional situation warranting our consideration of an untimely and number-barred motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992) (noting motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien).
 
*2 We also conclude that the respondent has not shown that any claimed ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes an exceptional situation that warrants sua sponte reopening. As previously noted by both the Immigration Judge and the Board, the respondent did not properly present his claims of ineffective assistance in the first instance when he filed his first motion to reopen. Moreover, as the Immigration Judge concluded, the respondent did not demonstrate that his failure to appear at his February 22, 2006, hearing was the result of ineffective assistance of prior counsel (I.J. at 4).
 
We are not unsympathetic to the situation now faced by the respondent, and the positive equities he presented in his motion. Nonetheless, sua sponte authority is invoked sparingly, and is not to be used as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, supra. In the present case, upon consideration of the totality of the record, we agree with the Immigration Judge that sua sponte reopening is not warranted (I.J. at 3-5). Accordingly, as we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s time and number-barred motion to reopen, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s motion is otherwise untimely and number-barred, and it has not been shown to qualify for an exception to the filing requirements imposed by law on motions in removal proceedings. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Damian J. Miklosovic, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wylly Jordan
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 15, 2014, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on March 19, 2002. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to credibility determinations and the likelihood of future events, under a “““clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that on January 10, 1999, the respondent’s mother was served with the Notice to Appear on behalf of the respondent, who was a minor at the time (Exhs. 1, 3). See Matter of Gomez-Gomez, 23 I&N Dec. 522 (BIA 2002) (finding that the Service had met its burden of proving a minor respondent’s removability where the father of an 8-year-old respondent signed the child’s Notice to Appear and furnished data on the Form I-213). The respondent’s mother received oral and written notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of a failure to appear and of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever she changed her address or telephone number during the proceeding (Exh. 1). The respondent did not appear for the hearing on March 19, 2002, and the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
An alien may not be entitled to receive notice of her hearing if she does not provide an address at which she may be contacted during proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B) (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. He acknowledged the respondent’s contention in her motion to reopen that she was eight years old and living with her mother when the notice of hearing was issued, and her mother never told her about a letter or an immigration hearing (I.J. Dec. at 2; Exh. 2). The notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s last known address, but it was returned to the Immigration Court as undeliverable, stamped with the notation “Not Deliverable as Addressed, Unable to Forward.” We agree with the Immigration Judge that this evidence indicates either the address provided by the respondent’s mother was inaccurate, or the respondent and her mother moved without notifying the court (I.J. Dec. at 2-3; Exh. 3). Consequently, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing. See United States v. Zelaya, 293 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that mailing a notice to the last known address is sufficient to satisfy the government’s duty to provide an alien with notice of a removal hearing).
 
*2 On appeal the respondent requests that her case be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration. However, the respondent has not submitted any evidence that she is eligible to apply for any relief, nor has she submitted any applications for relief. To the extent the respondent’s appeal implies that the attorney who assisted her in filing a motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance of counsel, she has failed to establish such a claim. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Consequently, the respondent has not submitted any evidence to address the issue further.
 
The respondent also states that she was the victim of abuse at different times in her life, and she is distressed at the prospect of returning to Honduras with her children, as crime and violence are rampant there. The time and number limits for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings if the basis of the motion is to apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions). However, the respondent has not submitted an asylum application, she does not allege or discuss any changed country conditions in Honduras to support her claim, and she has not presented any evidence of a change in country conditions which is material to her claim for asylum. Therefore, the respondent is not exempt from the 90-day time limitation because she has not shown that it is based on changed country conditions arising in Honduras since the date of her removal order.

We further find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Swaim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied. This case was last before the Board on October 23, 2015, when the Board, finding that the respondent knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal, dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On April 18, 2016, the respondent filed the present motion. However, the motion is untimely filed and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable time limits based on the respondent’s alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel(s) claim. The evidence proffered along with the respondent’s motion does not sufficiently demonstrate that further hearings on his asserted eligibility for adjustment of status are warranted. See also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-74 (BIA 1992) (recognizing that the respondent bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). To date, only minimal evidence of the bona fides of the respondent’s current marriage, which was entered into during the pendency of these removal proceedings, has been proffered and there is no evidence that the respondent’s I-130 has been approved.
 
On this record we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated patent error or prejudice stemming from former counsel(s) alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (noting that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (proving prejudice requires that the petitioner make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief the sought). Nor are we persuaded that reconsideration of the prior Board decision or reopening of these proceedings is warranted in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied as untimely filed.

IN RE: JUAN C. PACHECO VILLATORO
File: AXXX XX0 302 - Baltimore, MD

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John J. Garzon, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 22, 2014, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States to El Salvador. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed, pursuant to this Board’s authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5), for the reasons set forth therein, and the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3(i), (ii), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. On appeal, the respondent contends that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that the Immigration Judge should have continued the respondent’s October 22, 2014, hearing based upon prior counsel’s stated desire to withdraw from representing the respondent.
 
The averments of respondent’s counsel on appeal that are not present in the record are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (statements of counsel in a brief are not evidence). Furthermore, the respondent’s claim, through counsel, that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance has not been established. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the general criteria for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Finally, prior counsel’s effort to withdraw, standing alone did not establish good cause for a continuance of the respondent’s removal proceeding pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 where the record establishes that the respondent and prior counsel were aware of the scheduled hearing and the obligation to be prepared to proceed with any application for relief before the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 5-9, 11-22). In this regard, prior counsel indicated on the record that pursuing voluntary departure and withholding of removal were also being considered but were not pursued. Also, at the final hearing, respondent’s prior counsel informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent was aware of his options. Thus, good cause to continue the respondent’s hearing did not exist as the respondent had notice of the timing and purpose of the hearing and did not comply with the deadline for submission of applications set by the Immigration Judge, thereby abandoning any application for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). On appeal, the respondent does not indicate what relief he is seeking or what he was prevented from presenting to the Immigration Court. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Kathryn E. Shepherd, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher Coxe
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents are natives and citizens of Guatemala who were placed in removal proceedings. Represented by counsel, they requested an order of removal, and did not request any relief from removal. On April 5, 2016, the Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondents. The order indicated that no other application for relief was requested, and that the appeal was waived.
 
The respondents did not file a timely Notice of Appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38 (Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision). The Department of Homeland Security represents that the respondents were detained on or about May 16, 2014. Thereafter, on May 24, 2016, the respondents filed a Notice of Appeal, as well as a request for a stay. Since the Notice of Appeal was filed after expiration of the 30 day time limit for filing a Notice of Appeal, the appeal is untimely.1
 
The respondents request that we accept the untimely appeal on certification, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), and remand the record because the respondents’ former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondents have not complied with Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondents assert that they wanted to file for asylum but their attorney did not comply with their request. However, their former attorney has not been notified of this claim, or been given an opportunity to respond.
 
The respondents also contend that permitting them to file an untimely Notice of Appeal would be a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The respondents have not demonstrated any specific disabilities applicable to them, or further demonstrated that the Rehabilitation Act specifically applies to them. Given these circumstances, we decline to accept the appeal on certification. The request for a stay is denied as moot.
 
Since we find that the appeal is untimely, the Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.
